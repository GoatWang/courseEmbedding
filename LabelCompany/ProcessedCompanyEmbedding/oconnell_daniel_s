dónall ó conaill  august  –  may  often referred to as the liberator or the emancipator was an irish political leader in the first half of the th century he campaigned for catholic emancipation—including the right for catholics to sit in the westminster parliament denied for over  years—and repeal of the act of union which combined great britain and ireland contents  early life

feud with disraeli  oconnell quotations  see also  footnotes  references  further reading  external links early lifeedit oconnell was born at carhan near cahersiveen county kerry to the oconnells of derrynane a oncewealthy roman catholic family that had been dispossessed of its lands among his uncles was daniel charles count oconnell an officer in the irish brigades of the french army a famous aunt was eibhlín dubh ní chonaill while sir james oconnell st baronet was his younger brother under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle maurice hunting cap oconnell he studied at douai in france and was admitted as a barrister to lincolns inn in  transferring to dublins kings inns two years later in his early years he became acquainted with the prodemocracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country oconnells home at derrynane while in dublin studying for the law oconnell was under his uncle maurices instructions not to become involved in any militia activity when wolfe tones french invasion fleet entered bantry bay in december  oconnell found himself in a quandary politics was the cause of his unsettlement dennis gwynn in his daniel oconnell the irish liberator suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of government yet the government was intensifying its persecution of the catholic people—of which he was one he desired to enter parliament yet every allowance that the catholics had been led to anticipate two years previously was now flatly vetoed as a law student oconnell was aware of his own talents but the higher ranks of the bar were closed to him he read the jockey club as a picture of the governing class in england and was persuaded by it that vice reigns triumphant in the english court at this day the spirit of liberty shrinks to protect property from the attacks of french innovators the corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments oconnells studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of ireland and the debates of the historical society concerned the records of governments and from this he was to conclude according to one of his biographers in ireland the whole policy of the government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority on  january  in an atmosphere of alarm over the french invasion fleet in bantry bay he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and being young active healthy and single he could offer no plausible excuse later that month for the sake of expediency he joined the lawyers artillery corps on  may  oconnell was called to the irish bar and became a barrister four days later the united irishmen staged their rebellion which was put down by the british with great bloodshed oconnell did not support the rebellion he believed that the irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force he went on the munster circuit and for over a decade he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of ireland he was reputed to have the largest income of any irish barrister but due to natural extravagance and a growing family was usually in debt his brother remarked caustically that daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen although he was ultimately to inherit derrynane from his uncle maurice the old man lived to be almost  and in the event daniels inheritance did not cover his debts he also condemned robert emmets rebellion of  of emmet a protestant he wrote a man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed so many murders—and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion despite his opposition to the use of violence he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused as in the doneraile conspiracy trials of  his last notable court appearance he was noted for his fearlessness in court if he thought poorly of a judge as was very often the case he had no hesitation in making this clear most famous perhaps was his retort to baron mcclelland who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course oconnell had adopted oconnell said that mcclelland had never been his model as a barrister neither would he take directions from him as a judge he did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself in particular he was attracted by the position of master of the rolls in ireland yet although he was offered it more than once finally refused campaigning for catholic emancipationedit oconnell returned to politics in the s in  he established the catholic board which campaigned for catholic emancipation that is the opportunity for irish catholics to become members of parliament in  he set up the catholic association which embraced other aims to better irish catholics such as electoral reform reform of the church of ireland tenants rights and economic development the association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month a minimal amount designed to attract catholic peasants the subscription was highly successful and the association raised a large sum of money in its first year the money was used to campaign for catholic emancipation specifically funding proemancipation members of parliament mps standing for the british house of commons statue of daniel oconnell outside st patricks cathedral melbourne members of the association were liable to prosecution under an eighteenthcentury statute and the crown moved to suppress the association by a series of prosecutions with mixed success oconnell was often briefed for the defence and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of catholics to argue for emancipation he clashed repeatedly with william saurin the attorney general for ireland and most influential figure in the dublin administration and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy in  a serious event in his life occurred dublin corporation was considered a stronghold of the protestant ascendancy and oconnell in an  speech referred to it as a beggarly corporation its members and leaders were outraged and because oconnell would not apologise one of their number the noted duellist john desterre challenged him the duel had filled dublin castle from where the british government administered ireland with tense excitement at the prospect that oconnell would be killed they regarded oconnell as worse than a public nuisance and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time oconnell met desterre and mortally wounded him he was shot in the hip the bullet then lodging in his stomach in a duel at oughterard county kildare his conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that not only had he killed a man but he had left his family almost destitute oconnell offered to share his income with desterres widow but she declined however she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter which oconnell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death the memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life and he refused ever to fight another being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again as part of his campaign for catholic emancipation oconnell created the catholic association in  this organisation acted as a pressure group against the british government so as to achieve emancipation the catholic rent which was established in  by oconnell and the catholic church raised funds from which oconnell was able to help finance the catholic association in its push for emancipation official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation as shown by the summary dismissal of william saurin the attorney general and a bigoted opponent of religious toleration whom oconnell called our mortal foe oconnell stood in a byelection to the british house of commons in  for county clare for a seat vacated by william vesey fitzgerald another supporter of the catholic association after oconnell won election he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the oath of supremacy which was incompatible with catholicism the prime minister the duke of wellington and the home secretary sir robert peel even though they opposed catholic participation in parliament saw that denying oconnell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in ireland which was about  catholic peel and wellington managed to convince george iv that catholic emancipation and the right of catholics and presbyterians and members of all christian faiths other than the established church of ireland to sit in parliament needed to be established with the help of the whigs it became law in  however the emancipation act was not made retrospective meaning that oconnell had either to seek reelection or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy when oconnell attempted on  may to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy solicitorgeneral nicholas conyngham tindal moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered oconnell was elected unopposed on  july  he took his seat when parliament resumed in february  by which time henry charles howard th duke of norfolk and earl of surrey had already become the first roman catholic to have taken advantage of the emancipation act and sit in parliament wellington is the king of england king george iv once complained oconnell is king of ireland and i am only the dean of windsor the regal jest expressed the general admiration for oconnell at the height of his career the catholic emancipation campaign led by oconnell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of british jews the subsequent jews relief act  allowing jewish mps to omit the words in the oath of allegiance and i make this declaration upon the true faith of a christian the tithe waredit daniel oconnell as depicted on the £ note of series c banknote of ireland ironically considering oconnells dedication to peaceful methods of political agitation his greatest political achievement ushered in a period of violence in ireland there was an obligation for those working the land to support the established church ie the united church of england and ireland by payments known as tithes the fact that the vast majority of those working the land in ireland were catholic or presbyterian tenant farmers supporting what was a minority religion within that island but not the united kingdom as a whole had been causing tension for some time in december  he and several others were tried for holding a meeting as an association or assemblage in violation of the orders of the lord lieutenant of ireland but the statute expired in course of judgment and the prosecution was terminated by the judiciary an initially peaceful campaign of nonpayment turned violent in  when the newly founded irish constabulary were used to seize property in lieu of payment resulting in the tithe war of – although opposed to the use of force oconnell successfully defended participants in the battle of carrickshock and all the defendants were acquitted nonetheless oconnell rejected william sharman crawfords call for the complete abolition of tithes in  as he felt he could not embarrass the whigs the lichfield house compact secured an alliance between whigs radicals and irish mps in  in  daniel oconnell became the first roman catholic lord mayor of dublin since the reign of james ii who had been the last roman catholic monarch of england ireland and scotland campaign for repeal of the unionedit oconnell monument on oconnell street in dublin once catholic emancipation was achieved oconnell campaigned for repeal of the act of union which in  had merged the parliaments of the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland to campaign for repeal oconnell set up the repeal association he argued for the recreation of an independent kingdom of ireland to govern itself with queen victoria as the queen of ireland to push for this he held a series of monster meetings throughout much of ireland outside the protestant and unionistdominated province of ulster they were so called because each was attended by around  people these rallies concerned the british government and the prime minister sir robert peel banned one such proposed monster meeting at clontarf county dublin just outside dublin city in  this move was made after the biggest monster meeting was held at tara tara held great significance to the irish population as it was the historic seat of the high kings of ireland clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the battle of clontarf in  when the irish king brian boru defeated his rival maelmordha although brian himself died during the battle despite appeals from his supporters oconnell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others he was arrested charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a years imprisonment and a fine of £ although he was released after three months by the house of lords which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial having deprived himself of his most potent weapon the monster meeting oconnell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the repeal association legacyedit daniel oconnell is honoured on the first commemorative stamps of ireland issued in  the round tower marking oconnells mausoleum mausoleum of daniel oconnell in glasnevin cemetery oconnell died of softening of the brain cerebral softening in  in genoa italy while on a pilgrimage to rome at the age of  his term in prison had seriously weakened him and the appallingly cold weather he had to endure on his journey was probably the final blow according to his dying wish his heart was buried in rome at santagata dei goti then the chapel of the irish college and the remainder of his body in glasnevin cemetery in dublin beneath a round tower his sons are buried in his crypt on  august  charles herbert mackintosh won the gold and silver medals offered by the st patricks society during the oconnell centenary at majors hill park in ottawa ontario for a prize poem entitled the irish liberator oconnells philosophy and career have inspired leaders all over the world including mahatma gandhi – and martin luther king – he was told by william makepeace thackeray – you have done more for your nation than any man since washington ever did william gladstone – described him as the greatest popular leader the world has ever seen honoré de balzac – wrote that napoleon and oconnell were the only great men the th century had ever seen jeanhenri merle daubigné – wrote that the only man like luther in the power he wielded was oconnell william grenville – wrote that history will speak of him as one of the most remarkable men that ever lived oconnell met befriended and became a great inspiration to frederick douglass – a former american slave who became a highly influential leader of the abolitionist movement social reformer orator writer and statesman oconnells attacks on slavery were made with his usual vigour and often gave great offence especially in the united states he called george washington a hypocrite and was challenged to a duel by andrew stevenson the american minister whom he was reported to have called a slave breeder however the founder of the irish labour party and executed easter rising leader james connolly devoted a chapter in his  book labour in irish history entitled a chapter of horrors daniel o’connell and the working class in which he criticised oconnells parliamentary record accusing him of siding consistently with the interests of the propertied classes of the united kingdom and patrick pearse connollys fellow leader of the easter rising wrote the leaders in ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment o’connell recoiled before the cannon at clontarf though adding i do not blame these men you or i might have done the same it is a terrible responsibility to be cast on a man that of bidding the cannon speak and the grapeshot pour in oconnells lifetime the aims of his repeal association—an independent kingdom of ireland governing itself but keeping the british monarch as its head of state—proved too radical for the british government of the time to accept and brought upon oconnell persecution and suppression oconnell is known in ireland as the liberator or the great emancipator for his success in achieving catholic emancipation oconnell admired latin american liberator simón bolívar and one of his sons morgan oconnell was a volunteer officer in bolívars army in  aged  the principal street in the centre of dublin previously called sackville street was renamed oconnell street in his honour in the early th century after the irish free state came into being his statue made by the sculptor john henry foley who also designed the sculptures of the albert memorial in london stands at one end of the street with a statue of charles stewart parnell at the other end the main street of limerick is also named after oconnell also with a statue at the end in the centre of the crescent oconnell streets also exist in ennis sligo athlone kilkee clonmel and waterford there is a statue honouring oconnell outside st patricks cathedral in melbourne australia as until the s the archdiocese of melbourne was almost entirely made up of irish immigrants or australians of irish descent there is a museum commemorating him in derrynane house near the village of derrynane county kerry which was once owned by his family he was a member of the literary association of the friends of poland as well familyedit  portrait of daniel oconnell by george hayter in  oconnell married his third cousin mary oconnell it was a love marriage and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage since daniels uncle maurice was outraged as mary had no fortune and for a time threatened to disinherit them they had four daughters three surviving ellen – catherine  elizabeth  and rickard  and four sons the sons—maurice  morgan  john  and daniel —all sat in parliament the marriage was happy and marys death in  was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered he was a devoted father ofaoláin suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him connection with the licensed tradeedit oconnell assisted his younger son daniel junior to acquire the phoenix brewery in jamess street dublin in  the brewery produced a brand known as oconnells ale and enjoyed some popularity by  oconnell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his sons company until he was no longer a member of parliament particularly because oconnell and arthur guinness were political enemies guinness was the moderate liberal candidate oconnell was the radical liberal candidate the rivalry caused dozens of irish firms to boycott guinness during the  repeal election it was at this time that guinness was accused of supporting the orange system and its beer was known as protestant porter when the oconnell family left brewing the rights to oconnell dublin ale was sold to john darcy the brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though and after a few years was taken over by the manager john brennan while daniel junior embraced a political career brennan changed the name back to the phoenix brewery but continued to brew and sell oconnells ale when the phoenix brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the guinness complex in  the brewing of oconnells ale was carried out by john darcy and son ltd at the anchor brewery in usher street in  darcys ceased trading and the firm of watkins jameson and pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with guinness daniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to daniel oconnell in his public life some time later a quarrel arose and oconnell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of temperance during the period of fr mathews total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held the most notable being a huge rally held on st patricks day in  daniel oconnell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the rotunda hospital comments on emancipationedit oconnell is on the left edge in this painting which is of the  world antislavery convention move your cursor to identify him or click icon to enlarge michael doheny in his the felons track says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an exaggerated and false guise and that it is an error to call it emancipation he went on that it was neither the first nor the last nor even the most important in the concessions which are entitled to the name of emancipation and that no one remembered the men whose exertions wrung from the reluctant spirit of a far darker time the right of living of worship of enjoying property and exercising the franchise dohenys opinion was that the penalties of the penal laws had been long abolished and that barbarous code had been compressed into cold and stolid exclusiveness and yet mr oconnell monopolised its entire renown the view put forward by john mitchel also one of the leading members of the young ireland movement in his jail journal was that there were two distinct movements in ireland during this period which were rousing the people one was the catholic relief agitation led by oconnell which was both open and legal the other was the secret societies known as the ribbon and white—boy movements the first proposed the admission of professional and genteel catholics to parliament and to the honours of the professions all under british law—the other originating in an utter horror and defiance of british law contemplated nothing less than a social and ultimately a political revolution according to mitchel for fear of the latter great britain with a very ill grace yielded to the first mitchel agrees that sir robert peel and the duke of wellington said they brought in this measure to avert civil war but says that no british statesman ever officially tells the truth or assigns to any act its real motive their real motive was according to mitchel to buy into the british interests the landed and educated catholics these respectable catholics would then be contented and become west britons from that day political beliefs and programmeedit daniel oconnell the champion of liberty poster published in pennsylvania  a critic of violent insurrection in ireland oconnell once said that the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood and yet as late as  oconnell had whipped his mps into line to keep the opium war going in china the tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war and oconnell had to call upon his mps to support the whig government as a result of this intervention the government was saved politically he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the british crown he often warned the british establishment that if they did not reform the governance of ireland irishmen would start to listen to the counsels of violent men successive british governments continued to ignore this advice long after his death although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted ie eliminating disabilities on roman catholics ensuring that lawfully elected roman catholics could serve their constituencies in the british parliament until the irish parliament was restored and amending the oath of allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to roman catholics who could then take the oath in good conscience although a native speaker of the irish language oconnell encouraged irish people to learn english to better themselves although he is best known for the campaign for catholic emancipation he also supported similar efforts for irish jews at his insistence in  the british law de judaismo which prescribed a special dress for jews was repealed oconnell said ireland has claims on your ancient race it is the only country that i know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the jews feud with disraeliedit in april  misled by inaccurate press reports oconnell thought disraeli had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him his name shows that he is of jewish origin i do not use it as a term of reproach there are many most respectable jews but there are as in every other people some of the lowest and most disgusting grade of moral turpitude and of those i look upon mr disraeli as the worst he has just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the cross and i verily believe if mr disraelis family herald were to be examined and his genealogy traced the same personage would be discovered to be the heir at law of the exalted individual to whom i allude i forgive mr disraeli now and as the lineal descendant of the blasphemous robber who ended his career beside the founder of the christian faith i leave the gentleman to the enjoyment of his infamous distinction and family

dispossessed of its lands among his uncles was daniel charles count oconnell an officer in the irish brigades of the french army a famous aunt was eibhlín dubh ní chonaill while sir james oconnell st baronet was his younger brother under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle maurice hunting cap oconnell he studied at douai in france and was admitted as a barrister to lincolns inn in  transferring to dublins kings inns two years later in his early years he became acquainted with the prodemocracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country oconnells home at derrynane while in dublin studying for the law oconnell was under his uncle maurices instructions not to become involved in any militia activity when wolfe tones french invasion fleet entered bantry bay in december  oconnell found himself in a quandary politics was the cause of his unsettlement dennis gwynn in his daniel oconnell the irish liberator suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of government yet the government was intensifying its persecution of the catholic people—of which he was one he desired to enter parliament yet every allowance that the catholics had been led to anticipate two years previously was now flatly vetoed as a law student oconnell was aware of his own talents but the higher ranks of the bar were closed to him he read the jockey club as a picture of the governing class in england and was persuaded by it that vice reigns triumphant in the english court at this day the spirit of liberty shrinks to protect property from the attacks of french innovators the corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments oconnells studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of ireland and the debates of the historical society concerned the records of governments and from this he was to conclude according to one of his biographers in ireland the whole policy of the government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority on  january  in an atmosphere of alarm over the french invasion fleet in bantry bay he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and being young active healthy and single he could offer no plausible excuse later that month for the sake of expediency he joined the lawyers artillery corps on  may  oconnell was called to the irish bar and became a barrister four days later the united irishmen staged their rebellion which was put down by the british with great bloodshed oconnell did not support the rebellion he believed that the irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force he went on the munster circuit and for over a decade he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of ireland he was reputed to have the largest income of any irish barrister but due to natural extravagance and a growing family was usually in debt his brother remarked caustically that daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen although he was ultimately to inherit derrynane from his uncle maurice the old man lived to be almost  and in the event daniels inheritance did not cover his debts he also condemned robert emmets rebellion of  of emmet a protestant he wrote a man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed so many murders—and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion despite his opposition to the use of violence he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused as in the doneraile conspiracy trials of  his last notable court appearance he was noted for his fearlessness in court if he thought poorly of a judge as was very often the case he had no hesitation in making this clear most famous perhaps was his retort to baron mcclelland who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course oconnell had adopted oconnell said that mcclelland had never been his model as a barrister neither would he take directions from him as a judge he did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself in particular he was attracted by the position of master of the rolls in ireland yet although he was offered it more than once finally refused campaigning for catholic emancipationedit oconnell returned to politics in the s in  he established the catholic board which campaigned for catholic emancipation that is the opportunity for irish catholics to become members of parliament in  he set up the catholic association which embraced other aims to better irish catholics such as electoral reform reform of the church of ireland tenants rights and economic development the association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month a minimal amount designed to attract catholic peasants the subscription was highly successful and the association raised a large sum of money in its first year the money was used to campaign for catholic emancipation specifically funding proemancipation members of parliament mps standing for the british house of commons statue of daniel oconnell outside st patricks cathedral melbourne members of the association were liable to prosecution under an eighteenthcentury statute and the crown moved to suppress the association by a series of prosecutions with mixed success oconnell was often briefed for the defence and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of catholics to argue for emancipation he clashed repeatedly with william saurin the attorney general for ireland and most influential figure in the dublin administration and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy in  a serious event in his life occurred dublin corporation was considered a stronghold of the protestant ascendancy and oconnell in an  speech referred to it as a beggarly corporation its members and leaders were outraged and because oconnell would not apologise one of their number the noted duellist john desterre challenged him the duel had filled dublin castle from where the british government administered ireland with tense excitement at the prospect that oconnell would be killed they regarded oconnell as worse than a public nuisance and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time oconnell met desterre and mortally wounded him he was shot in the hip the bullet then lodging in his stomach in a duel at oughterard county kildare his conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that not only had he killed a man but he had left his family almost destitute oconnell offered to share his income with desterres widow but she declined however she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter which oconnell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death the memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life and he refused ever to fight another being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again as part of his campaign for catholic emancipation oconnell created the catholic association in  this organisation acted as a pressure group against the british government so as to achieve emancipation the catholic rent which was established in  by oconnell and the catholic church raised funds from which oconnell was able to help finance the catholic association in its push for emancipation official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation as shown by the summary dismissal of william saurin the attorney general and a bigoted opponent of religious toleration whom oconnell called our mortal foe oconnell stood in a byelection to the british house of commons in  for county clare for a seat vacated by william vesey fitzgerald another supporter of the catholic association after oconnell won election he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the oath of supremacy which was incompatible with catholicism the prime minister the duke of wellington and the home secretary sir robert peel even though they opposed catholic participation in parliament saw that denying oconnell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in ireland which was about  catholic peel and wellington managed to convince george iv that catholic emancipation and the right of catholics and presbyterians and members of all christian faiths other than the established church of ireland to sit in parliament needed to be established with the help of the whigs it became law in  however the emancipation act was not made retrospective meaning that oconnell had either to seek reelection or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy when oconnell attempted on  may to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy solicitorgeneral nicholas conyngham tindal moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered oconnell was elected unopposed on  july  he took his seat when parliament resumed in february  by which time henry charles howard th duke of norfolk and earl of surrey had already become the first roman catholic to have taken advantage of the emancipation act and sit in parliament wellington is the king of england king george iv once complained oconnell is king of ireland and i am only the dean of windsor the regal jest expressed the general admiration for oconnell at the height of his career the catholic emancipation campaign led by oconnell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of british jews the subsequent jews relief act  allowing jewish mps to omit the words in the oath of allegiance and i make this declaration upon the true faith of a christian the tithe waredit daniel oconnell as depicted on the £ note of series c banknote of ireland ironically considering oconnells dedication to peaceful methods of political agitation his greatest political achievement ushered in a period of violence in ireland there was an obligation for those working the land to support the established church ie the united church of england and ireland by payments known as tithes the fact that the vast majority of those working the land in ireland were catholic or presbyterian tenant farmers supporting what was a minority religion within that island but not the united kingdom as a whole had been causing tension for some time in december  he and several others were tried for holding a meeting as an association or assemblage in violation of the orders of the lord lieutenant of ireland but the statute expired in course of judgment and the prosecution was terminated by the judiciary an initially peaceful campaign of nonpayment turned violent in  when the newly founded irish constabulary were used to seize property in lieu of payment resulting in the tithe war of – although opposed to the use of force oconnell successfully defended participants in the battle of carrickshock and all the defendants were acquitted nonetheless oconnell rejected william sharman crawfords call for the complete abolition of tithes in  as he felt he could not embarrass the whigs the lichfield house compact secured an alliance between whigs radicals and irish mps in  in  daniel oconnell became the first roman catholic lord mayor of dublin since the reign of james ii who had been the last roman catholic monarch of england ireland and scotland campaign for repeal of the unionedit oconnell monument on oconnell street in dublin once catholic emancipation was achieved oconnell campaigned for repeal of the act of union which in  had merged the parliaments of the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland to campaign for repeal oconnell set up the repeal association he argued for the recreation of an independent kingdom of ireland to govern itself with queen victoria as the queen of ireland to push for this he held a series of monster meetings throughout much of ireland outside the protestant and unionistdominated province of ulster they were so called because each was attended by around  people these rallies concerned the british government and the prime minister sir robert peel banned one such proposed monster meeting at clontarf county dublin just outside dublin city in  this move was made after the biggest monster meeting was held at tara tara held great significance to the irish population as it was the historic seat of the high kings of ireland clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the battle of clontarf in  when the irish king brian boru defeated his rival maelmordha although brian himself died during the battle despite appeals from his supporters oconnell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others he was arrested charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a years imprisonment and a fine of £ although he was released after three months by the house of lords which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial having deprived himself of his most potent weapon the monster meeting oconnell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the repeal association legacyedit daniel oconnell is honoured on the first commemorative stamps of ireland issued in  the round tower marking oconnells mausoleum mausoleum of daniel oconnell in glasnevin cemetery oconnell died of softening of the brain cerebral softening in  in genoa italy while on a pilgrimage to rome at the age of  his term in prison had seriously weakened him and the appallingly cold weather he had to endure on his journey was probably the final blow according to his dying wish his heart was buried in rome at santagata dei goti then the chapel of the irish college and the remainder of his body in glasnevin cemetery in dublin beneath a round tower his sons are buried in his crypt on  august  charles herbert mackintosh won the gold and silver medals offered by the st patricks society during the oconnell centenary at majors hill park in ottawa ontario for a prize poem entitled the irish liberator oconnells philosophy and career have inspired leaders all over the world including mahatma gandhi – and martin luther king – he was told by william makepeace thackeray – you have done more for your nation than any man since washington ever did william gladstone – described him as the greatest popular leader the world has ever seen honoré de balzac – wrote that napoleon and oconnell were the only great men the th century had ever seen jeanhenri merle daubigné – wrote that the only man like luther in the power he wielded was oconnell william grenville – wrote that history will speak of him as one of the most remarkable men that ever lived oconnell met befriended and became a great inspiration to frederick douglass – a former american slave who became a highly influential leader of the abolitionist movement social reformer orator writer and statesman oconnells attacks on slavery were made with his usual vigour and often gave great offence especially in the united states he called george washington a hypocrite and was challenged to a duel by andrew stevenson the american minister whom he was reported to have called a slave breeder however the founder of the irish labour party and executed easter rising leader james connolly devoted a chapter in his  book labour in irish history entitled a chapter of horrors daniel o’connell and the working class in which he criticised oconnells parliamentary record accusing him of siding consistently with the interests of the propertied classes of the united kingdom and patrick pearse connollys fellow leader of the easter rising wrote the leaders in ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment o’connell recoiled before the cannon at clontarf though adding i do not blame these men you or i might have done the same it is a terrible responsibility to be cast on a man that of bidding the cannon speak and the grapeshot pour in oconnells lifetime the aims of his repeal association—an independent kingdom of ireland governing itself but keeping the british monarch as its head of state—proved too radical for the british government of the time to accept and brought upon oconnell persecution and suppression oconnell is known in ireland as the liberator or the great emancipator for his success in achieving catholic emancipation oconnell admired latin american liberator simón bolívar and one of his sons morgan oconnell was a volunteer officer in bolívars army in  aged  the principal street in the centre of dublin previously called sackville street was renamed oconnell street in his honour in the early th century after the irish free state came into being his statue made by the sculptor john henry foley who also designed the sculptures of the albert memorial in london stands at one end of the street with a statue of charles stewart parnell at the other end the main street of limerick is also named after oconnell also with a statue at the end in the centre of the crescent oconnell streets also exist in ennis sligo athlone kilkee clonmel and waterford there is a statue honouring oconnell outside st patricks cathedral in melbourne australia as until the s the archdiocese of melbourne was almost entirely made up of irish immigrants or australians of irish descent there is a museum commemorating him in derrynane house near the village of derrynane county kerry which was once owned by his family he was a member of the literary association of the friends of poland as well familyedit  portrait of daniel oconnell by george hayter in  oconnell married his third cousin mary oconnell it was a love marriage and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage since daniels uncle maurice was outraged as mary had no fortune and for a time threatened to disinherit them they had four daughters three surviving ellen – catherine  elizabeth  and rickard  and four sons the sons—maurice  morgan  john  and daniel —all sat in parliament the marriage was happy and marys death in  was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered he was a devoted father ofaoláin suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him connection with the licensed tradeedit oconnell assisted his younger son daniel junior to acquire the phoenix brewery in jamess street dublin in  the brewery produced a brand known as oconnells ale and enjoyed some popularity by  oconnell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his sons company until he was no longer a member of parliament particularly because oconnell and arthur guinness were political enemies guinness was the moderate liberal candidate oconnell was the radical liberal candidate the rivalry caused dozens of irish firms to boycott guinness during the  repeal election it was at this time that guinness was accused of supporting the orange system and its beer was known as protestant porter when the oconnell family left brewing the rights to oconnell dublin ale was sold to john darcy the brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though and after a few years was taken over by the manager john brennan while daniel junior embraced a political career brennan changed the name back to the phoenix brewery but continued to brew and sell oconnells ale when the phoenix brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the guinness complex in  the brewing of oconnells ale was carried out by john darcy and son ltd at the anchor brewery in usher street in  darcys ceased trading and the firm of watkins jameson and pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with guinness daniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to daniel oconnell in his public life some time later a quarrel arose and oconnell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of temperance during the period of fr mathews total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held the most notable being a huge rally held on st patricks day in  daniel oconnell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the rotunda hospital comments on emancipationedit oconnell is on the left edge in this painting which is of the  world antislavery convention move your cursor to identify him or click icon to enlarge michael doheny in his the felons track says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an exaggerated and false guise and that it is an error to call it emancipation he went on that it was neither the first nor the last nor even the most important in the concessions which are entitled to the name of emancipation and that no one remembered the men whose exertions wrung from the reluctant spirit of a far darker time the right of living of worship of enjoying property and exercising the franchise dohenys opinion was that the penalties of the penal laws had been long abolished and that barbarous code had been compressed into cold and stolid exclusiveness and yet mr oconnell monopolised its entire renown the view put forward by john mitchel also one of the leading members of the young ireland movement in his jail journal was that there were two distinct movements in ireland during this period which were rousing the people one was the catholic relief agitation led by oconnell which was both open and legal the other was the secret societies known as the ribbon and white—boy movements the first proposed the admission of professional and genteel catholics to parliament and to the honours of the professions all under british law—the other originating in an utter horror and defiance of british law contemplated nothing less than a social and ultimately a political revolution according to mitchel for fear of the latter great britain with a very ill grace yielded to the first mitchel agrees that sir robert peel and the duke of wellington said they brought in this measure to avert civil war but says that no british statesman ever officially tells the truth or assigns to any act its real motive their real motive was according to mitchel to buy into the british interests the landed and educated catholics these respectable catholics would then be contented and become west britons from that day political beliefs and programmeedit daniel oconnell the champion of liberty poster published in pennsylvania  a critic of violent insurrection in ireland oconnell once said that the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood and yet as late as  oconnell had whipped his mps into line to keep the opium war going in china the tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war and oconnell had to call upon his mps to support the whig government as a result of this intervention the government was saved politically he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the british crown he often warned the british establishment that if they did not reform the governance of ireland irishmen would start to listen to the counsels of violent men successive british governments continued to ignore this advice long after his death although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted ie eliminating disabilities on roman catholics ensuring that lawfully elected roman catholics could serve their constituencies in the british parliament until the irish parliament was restored and amending the oath of allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to roman catholics who could then take the oath in good conscience although a native speaker of the irish language oconnell encouraged irish people to learn english to better themselves although he is best known for the campaign for catholic emancipation he also supported similar efforts for irish jews at his insistence in  the british law de judaismo which prescribed a special dress for jews was repealed oconnell said ireland has claims on your ancient race it is the only country that i know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the jews feud with disraeliedit in april  misled by inaccurate press reports oconnell thought disraeli had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him his name shows that he is of jewish origin i do not use it as a term of reproach there are many most respectable jews but there are as in every other people some of the lowest and most disgusting grade of moral turpitude and of those i look upon mr disraeli as the worst he has just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the cross and i verily believe if mr disraelis family herald were to be examined and his genealogy traced the same personage would be discovered to be the heir at law of the exalted individual to whom i allude i forgive mr disraeli now and as the lineal descendant of the blasphemous robber who ended his career beside the founder of the christian faith i leave the gentleman to the enjoyment of his infamous distinction and family honours disraeli sought satisfaction by challenging oconnells son morgan to a duel daniel

dispossessed of its lands among his uncles was daniel charles count oconnell an officer in the irish brigades of the french army a famous aunt was eibhlín dubh ní chonaill while sir james oconnell st baronet was his younger brother under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle maurice hunting cap oconnell he studied at douai in france and was admitted as a barrister to lincolns inn in  transferring to dublins kings inns two years later in his early years he became acquainted with the prodemocracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country oconnells home at derrynane while in dublin studying for the law oconnell was under his uncle maurices instructions not to become involved in any militia activity when wolfe tones french invasion fleet entered bantry bay in december  oconnell found himself in a quandary politics was the cause of his unsettlement dennis gwynn in his daniel oconnell the irish liberator suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of government yet the government was intensifying its persecution of the catholic people—of which he was one he desired to enter parliament yet every allowance that the catholics had been led to anticipate two years previously was now flatly vetoed as a law student oconnell was aware of his own talents but the higher ranks of the bar were closed to him he read the jockey club as a picture of the governing class in england and was persuaded by it that vice reigns triumphant in the english court at this day the spirit of liberty shrinks to protect property from the attacks of french innovators the corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments oconnells studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of ireland and the debates of the historical society concerned the records of governments and from this he was to conclude according to one of his biographers in ireland the whole policy of the government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority on  january  in an atmosphere of alarm over the french invasion fleet in bantry bay he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and being young active healthy and single he could offer no plausible excuse later that month for the sake of expediency he joined the lawyers artillery corps on  may  oconnell was called to the irish bar and became a barrister four days later the united irishmen staged their rebellion which was put down by the british with great bloodshed oconnell did not support the rebellion he believed that the irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force he went on the munster circuit and for over a decade he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of ireland he was reputed to have the largest income of any irish barrister but due to natural extravagance and a growing family was usually in debt his brother remarked caustically that daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen although he was ultimately to inherit derrynane from his uncle maurice the old man lived to be almost  and in the event daniels inheritance did not cover his debts he also condemned robert emmets rebellion of  of emmet a protestant he wrote a man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed so many murders—and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion despite his opposition to the use of violence he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused as in the doneraile conspiracy trials of  his last notable court appearance he was noted for his fearlessness in court if he thought poorly of a judge as was very often the case he had no hesitation in making this clear most famous perhaps was his retort to baron mcclelland who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course oconnell had adopted oconnell said that mcclelland had never been his model as a barrister neither would he take directions from him as a judge he did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself in particular he was attracted by the position of master of the rolls in ireland yet although he was offered it more than once finally refused campaigning for catholic emancipationedit oconnell returned to politics in the s in  he established the catholic board which campaigned for catholic emancipation that is the opportunity for irish catholics to become members of parliament in  he set up the catholic association which embraced other aims to better irish catholics such as electoral reform reform of the church of ireland tenants rights and economic development the association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month a minimal amount designed to attract catholic peasants the subscription was highly successful and the association raised a large sum of money in its first year the money was used to campaign for catholic emancipation specifically funding proemancipation members of parliament mps standing for the british house of commons statue of daniel oconnell outside st patricks cathedral melbourne members of the association were liable to prosecution under an eighteenthcentury statute and the crown moved to suppress the association by a series of prosecutions with mixed success oconnell was often briefed for the defence and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of catholics to argue for emancipation he clashed repeatedly with william saurin the attorney general for ireland and most influential figure in the dublin administration and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy in  a serious event in his life occurred dublin corporation was considered a stronghold of the protestant ascendancy and oconnell in an  speech referred to it as a beggarly corporation its members and leaders were outraged and because oconnell would not apologise one of their number the noted duellist john desterre challenged him the duel had filled dublin castle from where the british government administered ireland with tense excitement at the prospect that oconnell would be killed they regarded oconnell as worse than a public nuisance and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time oconnell met desterre and mortally wounded him he was shot in the hip the bullet then lodging in his stomach in a duel at oughterard county kildare his conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that not only had he killed a man but he had left his family almost destitute oconnell offered to share his income with desterres widow but she declined however she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter which oconnell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death the memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life and he refused ever to fight another being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again as part of his campaign for catholic emancipation oconnell created the catholic association in  this organisation acted as a pressure group against the british government so as to achieve emancipation the catholic rent which was established in  by oconnell and the catholic church raised funds from which oconnell was able to help finance the catholic association in its push for emancipation official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation as shown by the summary dismissal of william saurin the attorney general and a bigoted opponent of religious toleration whom oconnell called our mortal foe oconnell stood in a byelection to the british house of commons in  for county clare for a seat vacated by william vesey fitzgerald another supporter of the catholic association after oconnell won election he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the oath of supremacy which was incompatible with catholicism the prime minister the duke of wellington and the home secretary sir robert peel even though they opposed catholic participation in parliament saw that denying oconnell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in ireland which was about  catholic peel and wellington managed to convince george iv that catholic emancipation and the right of catholics and presbyterians and members of all christian faiths other than the established church of ireland to sit in parliament needed to be established with the help of the whigs it became law in  however the emancipation act was not made retrospective meaning that oconnell had either to seek reelection or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy when oconnell attempted on  may to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy solicitorgeneral nicholas conyngham tindal moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered oconnell was elected unopposed on  july  he took his seat when parliament resumed in february  by which time henry charles howard th duke of norfolk and earl of surrey had already become the first roman catholic to have taken advantage of the emancipation act and sit in parliament wellington is the king of england king george iv once complained oconnell is king of ireland and i am only the dean of windsor the regal jest expressed the general admiration for oconnell at the height of his career the catholic emancipation campaign led by oconnell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of british jews the subsequent jews relief act  allowing jewish mps to omit the words in the oath of allegiance and i make this declaration upon the true faith of a christian the tithe waredit daniel oconnell as depicted on the £ note of series c banknote of ireland ironically considering oconnells dedication to peaceful methods of political agitation his greatest political achievement ushered in a period of violence in ireland there was an obligation for those working the land to support the established church ie the united church of england and ireland by payments known as tithes the fact that the vast majority of those working the land in ireland were catholic or presbyterian tenant farmers supporting what was a minority religion within that island but not the united kingdom as a whole had been causing tension for some time in december  he and several others were tried for holding a meeting as an association or assemblage in violation of the orders of the lord lieutenant of ireland but the statute expired in course of judgment and the prosecution was terminated by the judiciary an initially peaceful campaign of nonpayment turned violent in  when the newly founded irish constabulary were used to seize property in lieu of payment resulting in the tithe war of – although opposed to the use of force oconnell successfully defended participants in the battle of carrickshock and all the defendants were acquitted nonetheless oconnell rejected william sharman crawfords call for the complete abolition of tithes in  as he felt he could not embarrass the whigs the lichfield house compact secured an alliance between whigs radicals and irish mps in  in  daniel oconnell became the first roman catholic lord mayor of dublin since the reign of james ii who had been the last roman catholic monarch of england ireland and scotland campaign for repeal of the unionedit oconnell monument on oconnell street in dublin once catholic emancipation was achieved oconnell campaigned for repeal of the act of union which in  had merged the parliaments of the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland to campaign for repeal oconnell set up the repeal association he argued for the recreation of an independent kingdom of ireland to govern itself with queen victoria as the queen of ireland to push for this he held a series of monster meetings throughout much of ireland outside the protestant and unionistdominated province of ulster they were so called because each was attended by around  people these rallies concerned the british government and the prime minister sir robert peel banned one such proposed monster meeting at clontarf county dublin just outside dublin city in  this move was made after the biggest monster meeting was held at tara tara held great significance to the irish population as it was the historic seat of the high kings of ireland clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the battle of clontarf in  when the irish king brian boru defeated his rival maelmordha although brian himself died during the battle despite appeals from his supporters oconnell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others he was arrested charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a years imprisonment and a fine of £ although he was released after three months by the house of lords which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial having deprived himself of his most potent weapon the monster meeting oconnell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the repeal association legacyedit daniel oconnell is honoured on the first commemorative stamps of ireland issued in  the round tower marking oconnells mausoleum mausoleum of daniel oconnell in glasnevin cemetery oconnell died of softening of the brain cerebral softening in  in genoa italy while on a pilgrimage to rome at the age of  his term in prison had seriously weakened him and the appallingly cold weather he had to endure on his journey was probably the final blow according to his dying wish his heart was buried in rome at santagata dei goti then the chapel of the irish college and the remainder of his body in glasnevin cemetery in dublin beneath a round tower his sons are buried in his crypt on  august  charles herbert mackintosh won the gold and silver medals offered by the st patricks society during the oconnell centenary at majors hill park in ottawa ontario for a prize poem entitled the irish liberator oconnells philosophy and career have inspired leaders all over the world including mahatma gandhi – and martin luther king – he was told by william makepeace thackeray – you have done more for your nation than any man since washington ever did william gladstone – described him as the greatest popular leader the world has ever seen honoré de balzac – wrote that napoleon and oconnell were the only great men the th century had ever seen jeanhenri merle daubigné – wrote that the only man like luther in the power he wielded was oconnell william grenville – wrote that history will speak of him as one of the most remarkable men that ever lived oconnell met befriended and became a great inspiration to frederick douglass – a former american slave who became a highly influential leader of the abolitionist movement social reformer orator writer and statesman oconnells attacks on slavery were made with his usual vigour and often gave great offence especially in the united states he called george washington a hypocrite and was challenged to a duel by andrew stevenson the american minister whom he was reported to have called a slave breeder however the founder of the irish labour party and executed easter rising leader james connolly devoted a chapter in his  book labour in irish history entitled a chapter of horrors daniel o’connell and the working class in which he criticised oconnells parliamentary record accusing him of siding consistently with the interests of the propertied classes of the united kingdom and patrick pearse connollys fellow leader of the easter rising wrote the leaders in ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment o’connell recoiled before the cannon at clontarf though adding i do not blame these men you or i might have done the same it is a terrible responsibility to be cast on a man that of bidding the cannon speak and the grapeshot pour in oconnells lifetime the aims of his repeal association—an independent kingdom of ireland governing itself but keeping the british monarch as its head of state—proved too radical for the british government of the time to accept and brought upon oconnell persecution and suppression oconnell is known in ireland as the liberator or the great emancipator for his success in achieving catholic emancipation oconnell admired latin american liberator simón bolívar and one of his sons morgan oconnell was a volunteer officer in bolívars army in  aged  the principal street in the centre of dublin previously called sackville street was renamed oconnell street in his honour in the early th century after the irish free state came into being his statue made by the sculptor john henry foley who also designed the sculptures of the albert memorial in london stands at one end of the street with a statue of charles stewart parnell at the other end the main street of limerick is also named after oconnell also with a statue at the end in the centre of the crescent oconnell streets also exist in ennis sligo athlone kilkee clonmel and waterford there is a statue honouring oconnell outside st patricks cathedral in melbourne australia as until the s the archdiocese of melbourne was almost entirely made up of irish immigrants or australians of irish descent there is a museum commemorating him in derrynane house near the village of derrynane county kerry which was once owned by his family he was a member of the literary association of the friends of poland as well familyedit  portrait of daniel oconnell by george hayter in  oconnell married his third cousin mary oconnell it was a love marriage and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage since daniels uncle maurice was outraged as mary had no fortune and for a time threatened to disinherit them they had four daughters three surviving ellen – catherine  elizabeth  and rickard  and four sons the sons—maurice  morgan  john  and daniel —all sat in parliament the marriage was happy and marys death in  was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered he was a devoted father ofaoláin suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him connection with the licensed tradeedit oconnell assisted his younger son daniel junior to acquire the phoenix brewery in jamess street dublin in  the brewery produced a brand known as oconnells ale and enjoyed some popularity by  oconnell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his sons company until he was no longer a member of parliament particularly because oconnell and arthur guinness were political enemies guinness was the moderate liberal candidate oconnell was the radical liberal candidate the rivalry caused dozens of irish firms to boycott guinness during the  repeal election it was at this time that guinness was accused of supporting the orange system and its beer was known as protestant porter when the oconnell family left brewing the rights to oconnell dublin ale was sold to john darcy the brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though and after a few years was taken over by the manager john brennan while daniel junior embraced a political career brennan changed the name back to the phoenix brewery but continued to brew and sell oconnells ale when the phoenix brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the guinness complex in  the brewing of oconnells ale was carried out by john darcy and son ltd at the anchor brewery in usher street in  darcys ceased trading and the firm of watkins jameson and pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with guinness daniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to daniel oconnell in his public life some time later a quarrel arose and oconnell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of temperance during the period of fr mathews total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held the most notable being a huge rally held on st patricks day in  daniel oconnell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the rotunda hospital comments on emancipationedit oconnell is on the left edge in this painting which is of the  world antislavery convention move your cursor to identify him or click icon to enlarge michael doheny in his the felons track says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an exaggerated and false guise and that it is an error to call it emancipation he went on that it was neither the first nor the last nor even the most important in the concessions which are entitled to the name of emancipation and that no one remembered the men whose exertions wrung from the reluctant spirit of a far darker time the right of living of worship of enjoying property and exercising the franchise dohenys opinion was that the penalties of the penal laws had been long abolished and that barbarous code had been compressed into cold and stolid exclusiveness and yet mr oconnell monopolised its entire renown the view put forward by john mitchel also one of the leading members of the young ireland movement in his jail journal was that there were two distinct movements in ireland during this period which were rousing the people one was the catholic relief agitation led by oconnell which was both open and legal the other was the secret societies known as the ribbon and white—boy movements the first proposed the admission of professional and genteel catholics to parliament and to the honours of the professions all under british law—the other originating in an utter horror and defiance of british law contemplated nothing less than a social and ultimately a political revolution according to mitchel for fear of the latter great britain with a very ill grace yielded to the first mitchel agrees that sir robert peel and the duke of wellington said they brought in this measure to avert civil war but says that no british statesman ever officially tells the truth or assigns to any act its real motive their real motive was according to mitchel to buy into the british interests the landed and educated catholics these respectable catholics would then be contented and become west britons from that day political beliefs and programmeedit daniel oconnell the champion of liberty poster published in pennsylvania  a critic of violent insurrection in ireland oconnell once said that the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood and yet as late as  oconnell had whipped his mps into line to keep the opium war going in china the tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war and oconnell had to call upon his mps to support the whig government as a result of this intervention the government was saved politically he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the british crown he often warned the british establishment that if they did not reform the governance of ireland irishmen would start to listen to the counsels of violent men successive british governments continued to ignore this advice long after his death although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted ie eliminating disabilities on roman catholics ensuring that lawfully elected roman catholics could serve their constituencies in the british parliament until the irish parliament was restored and amending the oath of allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to roman catholics who could then take the oath in good conscience although a native speaker of the irish language oconnell encouraged irish people to learn english to better themselves although he is best known for the campaign for catholic emancipation he also supported similar efforts for irish jews at his insistence in  the british law de judaismo which prescribed a special dress for jews was repealed oconnell said ireland has claims on your ancient race it is the only country that i know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the jews feud with disraeliedit in april  misled by inaccurate press reports oconnell thought disraeli had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him his name shows that he is of jewish origin i do not use it as a term of reproach there are many most respectable jews but there are as in every other people some of the lowest and most disgusting grade of moral turpitude and of those i look upon mr disraeli as the worst he has just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the cross and i verily believe if mr disraelis family herald were to be examined and his genealogy traced the same personage would be discovered to be the heir at law of the exalted individual to whom i allude i forgive mr disraeli now and as the lineal descendant of the blasphemous robber who ended his career beside the founder of the christian faith i leave the gentleman to the enjoyment of his infamous distinction and family honours disraeli sought satisfaction by challenging oconnells son morgan to a duel daniel having sworn never to duel again after previously killing a man morgan declined replying he was not responsible for his fathers words oconnell quotationsedit oconnnells last wish wikiquote has

dispossessed of its lands among his uncles was daniel charles count oconnell an officer in the irish brigades of the french army a famous aunt was eibhlín dubh ní chonaill while sir james oconnell st baronet was his younger brother under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle maurice hunting cap oconnell he studied at douai in france and was admitted as a barrister to lincolns inn in  transferring to dublins kings inns two years later in his early years he became acquainted with the prodemocracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country oconnells home at derrynane while in dublin studying for the law oconnell was under his uncle maurices instructions not to become involved in any militia activity when wolfe tones french invasion fleet entered bantry bay in december  oconnell found himself in a quandary politics was the cause of his unsettlement dennis gwynn in his daniel oconnell the irish liberator suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of government yet the government was intensifying its persecution of the catholic people—of which he was one he desired to enter parliament yet every allowance that the catholics had been led to anticipate two years previously was now flatly vetoed as a law student oconnell was aware of his own talents but the higher ranks of the bar were closed to him he read the jockey club as a picture of the governing class in england and was persuaded by it that vice reigns triumphant in the english court at this day the spirit of liberty shrinks to protect property from the attacks of french innovators the corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments oconnells studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of ireland and the debates of the historical society concerned the records of governments and from this he was to conclude according to one of his biographers in ireland the whole policy of the government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority on  january  in an atmosphere of alarm over the french invasion fleet in bantry bay he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and being young active healthy and single he could offer no plausible excuse later that month for the sake of expediency he joined the lawyers artillery corps on  may  oconnell was called to the irish bar and became a barrister four days later the united irishmen staged their rebellion which was put down by the british with great bloodshed oconnell did not support the rebellion he believed that the irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force he went on the munster circuit and for over a decade he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of ireland he was reputed to have the largest income of any irish barrister but due to natural extravagance and a growing family was usually in debt his brother remarked caustically that daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen although he was ultimately to inherit derrynane from his uncle maurice the old man lived to be almost  and in the event daniels inheritance did not cover his debts he also condemned robert emmets rebellion of  of emmet a protestant he wrote a man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed so many murders—and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion despite his opposition to the use of violence he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused as in the doneraile conspiracy trials of  his last notable court appearance he was noted for his fearlessness in court if he thought poorly of a judge as was very often the case he had no hesitation in making this clear most famous perhaps was his retort to baron mcclelland who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course oconnell had adopted oconnell said that mcclelland had never been his model as a barrister neither would he take directions from him as a judge he did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself in particular he was attracted by the position of master of the rolls in ireland yet although he was offered it more than once finally refused campaigning for catholic emancipationedit oconnell returned to politics in the s in  he established the catholic board which campaigned for catholic emancipation that is the opportunity for irish catholics to become members of parliament in  he set up the catholic association which embraced other aims to better irish catholics such as electoral reform reform of the church of ireland tenants rights and economic development the association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month a minimal amount designed to attract catholic peasants the subscription was highly successful and the association raised a large sum of money in its first year the money was used to campaign for catholic emancipation specifically funding proemancipation members of parliament mps standing for the british house of commons statue of daniel oconnell outside st patricks cathedral melbourne members of the association were liable to prosecution under an eighteenthcentury statute and the crown moved to suppress the association by a series of prosecutions with mixed success oconnell was often briefed for the defence and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of catholics to argue for emancipation he clashed repeatedly with william saurin the attorney general for ireland and most influential figure in the dublin administration and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy in  a serious event in his life occurred dublin corporation was considered a stronghold of the protestant ascendancy and oconnell in an  speech referred to it as a beggarly corporation its members and leaders were outraged and because oconnell would not apologise one of their number the noted duellist john desterre challenged him the duel had filled dublin castle from where the british government administered ireland with tense excitement at the prospect that oconnell would be killed they regarded oconnell as worse than a public nuisance and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time oconnell met desterre and mortally wounded him he was shot in the hip the bullet then lodging in his stomach in a duel at oughterard county kildare his conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that not only had he killed a man but he had left his family almost destitute oconnell offered to share his income with desterres widow but she declined however she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter which oconnell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death the memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life and he refused ever to fight another being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again as part of his campaign for catholic emancipation oconnell created the catholic association in  this organisation acted as a pressure group against the british government so as to achieve emancipation the catholic rent which was established in  by oconnell and the catholic church raised funds from which oconnell was able to help finance the catholic association in its push for emancipation official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation as shown by the summary dismissal of william saurin the attorney general and a bigoted opponent of religious toleration whom oconnell called our mortal foe oconnell stood in a byelection to the british house of commons in  for county clare for a seat vacated by william vesey fitzgerald another supporter of the catholic association after oconnell won election he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the oath of supremacy which was incompatible with catholicism the prime minister the duke of wellington and the home secretary sir robert peel even though they opposed catholic participation in parliament saw that denying oconnell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in ireland which was about  catholic peel and wellington managed to convince george iv that catholic emancipation and the right of catholics and presbyterians and members of all christian faiths other than the established church of ireland to sit in parliament needed to be established with the help of the whigs it became law in  however the emancipation act was not made retrospective meaning that oconnell had either to seek reelection or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy when oconnell attempted on  may to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy solicitorgeneral nicholas conyngham tindal moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered oconnell was elected unopposed on  july  he took his seat when parliament resumed in february  by which time henry charles howard th duke of norfolk and earl of surrey had already become the first roman catholic to have taken advantage of the emancipation act and sit in parliament wellington is the king of england king george iv once complained oconnell is king of ireland and i am only the dean of windsor the regal jest expressed the general admiration for oconnell at the height of his career the catholic emancipation campaign led by oconnell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of british jews the subsequent jews relief act  allowing jewish mps to omit the words in the oath of allegiance and i make this declaration upon the true faith of a christian the tithe waredit daniel oconnell as depicted on the £ note of series c banknote of ireland ironically considering oconnells dedication to peaceful methods of political agitation his greatest political achievement ushered in a period of violence in ireland there was an obligation for those working the land to support the established church ie the united church of england and ireland by payments known as tithes the fact that the vast majority of those working the land in ireland were catholic or presbyterian tenant farmers supporting what was a minority religion within that island but not the united kingdom as a whole had been causing tension for some time in december  he and several others were tried for holding a meeting as an association or assemblage in violation of the orders of the lord lieutenant of ireland but the statute expired in course of judgment and the prosecution was terminated by the judiciary an initially peaceful campaign of nonpayment turned violent in  when the newly founded irish constabulary were used to seize property in lieu of payment resulting in the tithe war of – although opposed to the use of force oconnell successfully defended participants in the battle of carrickshock and all the defendants were acquitted nonetheless oconnell rejected william sharman crawfords call for the complete abolition of tithes in  as he felt he could not embarrass the whigs the lichfield house compact secured an alliance between whigs radicals and irish mps in  in  daniel oconnell became the first roman catholic lord mayor of dublin since the reign of james ii who had been the last roman catholic monarch of england ireland and scotland campaign for repeal of the unionedit oconnell monument on oconnell street in dublin once catholic emancipation was achieved oconnell campaigned for repeal of the act of union which in  had merged the parliaments of the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland to campaign for repeal oconnell set up the repeal association he argued for the recreation of an independent kingdom of ireland to govern itself with queen victoria as the queen of ireland to push for this he held a series of monster meetings throughout much of ireland outside the protestant and unionistdominated province of ulster they were so called because each was attended by around  people these rallies concerned the british government and the prime minister sir robert peel banned one such proposed monster meeting at clontarf county dublin just outside dublin city in  this move was made after the biggest monster meeting was held at tara tara held great significance to the irish population as it was the historic seat of the high kings of ireland clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the battle of clontarf in  when the irish king brian boru defeated his rival maelmordha although brian himself died during the battle despite appeals from his supporters oconnell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others he was arrested charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a years imprisonment and a fine of £ although he was released after three months by the house of lords which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial having deprived himself of his most potent weapon the monster meeting oconnell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the repeal association legacyedit daniel oconnell is honoured on the first commemorative stamps of ireland issued in  the round tower marking oconnells mausoleum mausoleum of daniel oconnell in glasnevin cemetery oconnell died of softening of the brain cerebral softening in  in genoa italy while on a pilgrimage to rome at the age of  his term in prison had seriously weakened him and the appallingly cold weather he had to endure on his journey was probably the final blow according to his dying wish his heart was buried in rome at santagata dei goti then the chapel of the irish college and the remainder of his body in glasnevin cemetery in dublin beneath a round tower his sons are buried in his crypt on  august  charles herbert mackintosh won the gold and silver medals offered by the st patricks society during the oconnell centenary at majors hill park in ottawa ontario for a prize poem entitled the irish liberator oconnells philosophy and career have inspired leaders all over the world including mahatma gandhi – and martin luther king – he was told by william makepeace thackeray – you have done more for your nation than any man since washington ever did william gladstone – described him as the greatest popular leader the world has ever seen honoré de balzac – wrote that napoleon and oconnell were the only great men the th century had ever seen jeanhenri merle daubigné – wrote that the only man like luther in the power he wielded was oconnell william grenville – wrote that history will speak of him as one of the most remarkable men that ever lived oconnell met befriended and became a great inspiration to frederick douglass – a former american slave who became a highly influential leader of the abolitionist movement social reformer orator writer and statesman oconnells attacks on slavery were made with his usual vigour and often gave great offence especially in the united states he called george washington a hypocrite and was challenged to a duel by andrew stevenson the american minister whom he was reported to have called a slave breeder however the founder of the irish labour party and executed easter rising leader james connolly devoted a chapter in his  book labour in irish history entitled a chapter of horrors daniel o’connell and the working class in which he criticised oconnells parliamentary record accusing him of siding consistently with the interests of the propertied classes of the united kingdom and patrick pearse connollys fellow leader of the easter rising wrote the leaders in ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment o’connell recoiled before the cannon at clontarf though adding i do not blame these men you or i might have done the same it is a terrible responsibility to be cast on a man that of bidding the cannon speak and the grapeshot pour in oconnells lifetime the aims of his repeal association—an independent kingdom of ireland governing itself but keeping the british monarch as its head of state—proved too radical for the british government of the time to accept and brought upon oconnell persecution and suppression oconnell is known in ireland as the liberator or the great emancipator for his success in achieving catholic emancipation oconnell admired latin american liberator simón bolívar and one of his sons morgan oconnell was a volunteer officer in bolívars army in  aged  the principal street in the centre of dublin previously called sackville street was renamed oconnell street in his honour in the early th century after the irish free state came into being his statue made by the sculptor john henry foley who also designed the sculptures of the albert memorial in london stands at one end of the street with a statue of charles stewart parnell at the other end the main street of limerick is also named after oconnell also with a statue at the end in the centre of the crescent oconnell streets also exist in ennis sligo athlone kilkee clonmel and waterford there is a statue honouring oconnell outside st patricks cathedral in melbourne australia as until the s the archdiocese of melbourne was almost entirely made up of irish immigrants or australians of irish descent there is a museum commemorating him in derrynane house near the village of derrynane county kerry which was once owned by his family he was a member of the literary association of the friends of poland as well familyedit  portrait of daniel oconnell by george hayter in  oconnell married his third cousin mary oconnell it was a love marriage and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage since daniels uncle maurice was outraged as mary had no fortune and for a time threatened to disinherit them they had four daughters three surviving ellen – catherine  elizabeth  and rickard  and four sons the sons—maurice  morgan  john  and daniel —all sat in parliament the marriage was happy and marys death in  was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered he was a devoted father ofaoláin suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him connection with the licensed tradeedit oconnell assisted his younger son daniel junior to acquire the phoenix brewery in jamess street dublin in  the brewery produced a brand known as oconnells ale and enjoyed some popularity by  oconnell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his sons company until he was no longer a member of parliament particularly because oconnell and arthur guinness were political enemies guinness was the moderate liberal candidate oconnell was the radical liberal candidate the rivalry caused dozens of irish firms to boycott guinness during the  repeal election it was at this time that guinness was accused of supporting the orange system and its beer was known as protestant porter when the oconnell family left brewing the rights to oconnell dublin ale was sold to john darcy the brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though and after a few years was taken over by the manager john brennan while daniel junior embraced a political career brennan changed the name back to the phoenix brewery but continued to brew and sell oconnells ale when the phoenix brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the guinness complex in  the brewing of oconnells ale was carried out by john darcy and son ltd at the anchor brewery in usher street in  darcys ceased trading and the firm of watkins jameson and pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with guinness daniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to daniel oconnell in his public life some time later a quarrel arose and oconnell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of temperance during the period of fr mathews total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held the most notable being a huge rally held on st patricks day in  daniel oconnell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the rotunda hospital comments on emancipationedit oconnell is on the left edge in this painting which is of the  world antislavery convention move your cursor to identify him or click icon to enlarge michael doheny in his the felons track says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an exaggerated and false guise and that it is an error to call it emancipation he went on that it was neither the first nor the last nor even the most important in the concessions which are entitled to the name of emancipation and that no one remembered the men whose exertions wrung from the reluctant spirit of a far darker time the right of living of worship of enjoying property and exercising the franchise dohenys opinion was that the penalties of the penal laws had been long abolished and that barbarous code had been compressed into cold and stolid exclusiveness and yet mr oconnell monopolised its entire renown the view put forward by john mitchel also one of the leading members of the young ireland movement in his jail journal was that there were two distinct movements in ireland during this period which were rousing the people one was the catholic relief agitation led by oconnell which was both open and legal the other was the secret societies known as the ribbon and white—boy movements the first proposed the admission of professional and genteel catholics to parliament and to the honours of the professions all under british law—the other originating in an utter horror and defiance of british law contemplated nothing less than a social and ultimately a political revolution according to mitchel for fear of the latter great britain with a very ill grace yielded to the first mitchel agrees that sir robert peel and the duke of wellington said they brought in this measure to avert civil war but says that no british statesman ever officially tells the truth or assigns to any act its real motive their real motive was according to mitchel to buy into the british interests the landed and educated catholics these respectable catholics would then be contented and become west britons from that day political beliefs and programmeedit daniel oconnell the champion of liberty poster published in pennsylvania  a critic of violent insurrection in ireland oconnell once said that the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood and yet as late as  oconnell had whipped his mps into line to keep the opium war going in china the tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war and oconnell had to call upon his mps to support the whig government as a result of this intervention the government was saved politically he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the british crown he often warned the british establishment that if they did not reform the governance of ireland irishmen would start to listen to the counsels of violent men successive british governments continued to ignore this advice long after his death although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted ie eliminating disabilities on roman catholics ensuring that lawfully elected roman catholics could serve their constituencies in the british parliament until the irish parliament was restored and amending the oath of allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to roman catholics who could then take the oath in good conscience although a native speaker of the irish language oconnell encouraged irish people to learn english to better themselves although he is best known for the campaign for catholic emancipation he also supported similar efforts for irish jews at his insistence in  the british law de judaismo which prescribed a special dress for jews was repealed oconnell said ireland has claims on your ancient race it is the only country that i know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the jews feud with disraeliedit in april  misled by inaccurate press reports oconnell thought disraeli had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him his name shows that he is of jewish origin i do not use it as a term of reproach there are many most respectable jews but there are as in every other people some of the lowest and most disgusting grade of moral turpitude and of those i look upon mr disraeli as the worst he has just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the cross and i verily believe if mr disraelis family herald were to be examined and his genealogy traced the same personage would be discovered to be the heir at law of the exalted individual to whom i allude i forgive mr disraeli now and as the lineal descendant of the blasphemous robber who ended his career beside the founder of the christian faith i leave the gentleman to the enjoyment of his infamous distinction and family honours disraeli sought satisfaction by challenging oconnells son morgan to a duel daniel

dispossessed of its lands among his uncles was daniel charles count oconnell an officer in the irish brigades of the french army a famous aunt was eibhlín dubh ní chonaill while sir james oconnell st baronet was his younger brother under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle maurice hunting cap oconnell he studied at douai in france and was admitted as a barrister to lincolns inn in  transferring to dublins kings inns two years later in his early years he became acquainted with the prodemocracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country oconnells home at derrynane while in dublin studying for the law oconnell was under his uncle maurices instructions not to become involved in any militia activity when wolfe tones french invasion fleet entered bantry bay in december  oconnell found himself in a quandary politics was the cause of his unsettlement dennis gwynn in his daniel oconnell the irish liberator suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of government yet the government was intensifying its persecution of the catholic people—of which he was one he desired to enter parliament yet every allowance that the catholics had been led to anticipate two years previously was now flatly vetoed as a law student oconnell was aware of his own talents but the higher ranks of the bar were closed to him he read the jockey club as a picture of the governing class in england and was persuaded by it that vice reigns triumphant in the english court at this day the spirit of liberty shrinks to protect property from the attacks of french innovators the corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments oconnells studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of ireland and the debates of the historical society concerned the records of governments and from this he was to conclude according to one of his biographers in ireland the whole policy of the government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority on  january  in an atmosphere of alarm over the french invasion fleet in bantry bay he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and being young active healthy and single he could offer no plausible excuse later that month for the sake of expediency he joined the lawyers artillery corps on  may  oconnell was called to the irish bar and became a barrister four days later the united irishmen staged their rebellion which was put down by the british with great bloodshed oconnell did not support the rebellion he believed that the irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force he went on the munster circuit and for over a decade he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of ireland he was reputed to have the largest income of any irish barrister but due to natural extravagance and a growing family was usually in debt his brother remarked caustically that daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen although he was ultimately to inherit derrynane from his uncle maurice the old man lived to be almost  and in the event daniels inheritance did not cover his debts he also condemned robert emmets rebellion of  of emmet a protestant he wrote a man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed so many murders—and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion despite his opposition to the use of violence he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused as in the doneraile conspiracy trials of  his last notable court appearance he was noted for his fearlessness in court if he thought poorly of a judge as was very often the case he had no hesitation in making this clear most famous perhaps was his retort to baron mcclelland who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course oconnell had adopted oconnell said that mcclelland had never been his model as a barrister neither would he take directions from him as a judge he did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself in particular he was attracted by the position of master of the rolls in ireland yet although he was offered it more than once finally refused campaigning for catholic emancipationedit oconnell returned to politics in the s in  he established the catholic board which campaigned for catholic emancipation that is the opportunity for irish catholics to become members of parliament in  he set up the catholic association which embraced other aims to better irish catholics such as electoral reform reform of the church of ireland tenants rights and economic development the association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month a minimal amount designed to attract catholic peasants the subscription was highly successful and the association raised a large sum of money in its first year the money was used to campaign for catholic emancipation specifically funding proemancipation members of parliament mps standing for the british house of commons statue of daniel oconnell outside st patricks cathedral melbourne members of the association were liable to prosecution under an eighteenthcentury statute and the crown moved to suppress the association by a series of prosecutions with mixed success oconnell was often briefed for the defence and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of catholics to argue for emancipation he clashed repeatedly with william saurin the attorney general for ireland and most influential figure in the dublin administration and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy in  a serious event in his life occurred dublin corporation was considered a stronghold of the protestant ascendancy and oconnell in an  speech referred to it as a beggarly corporation its members and leaders were outraged and because oconnell would not apologise one of their number the noted duellist john desterre challenged him the duel had filled dublin castle from where the british government administered ireland with tense excitement at the prospect that oconnell would be killed they regarded oconnell as worse than a public nuisance and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time oconnell met desterre and mortally wounded him he was shot in the hip the bullet then lodging in his stomach in a duel at oughterard county kildare his conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that not only had he killed a man but he had left his family almost destitute oconnell offered to share his income with desterres widow but she declined however she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter which oconnell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death the memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life and he refused ever to fight another being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again as part of his campaign for catholic emancipation oconnell created the catholic association in  this organisation acted as a pressure group against the british government so as to achieve emancipation the catholic rent which was established in  by oconnell and the catholic church raised funds from which oconnell was able to help finance the catholic association in its push for emancipation official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation as shown by the summary dismissal of william saurin the attorney general and a bigoted opponent of religious toleration whom oconnell called our mortal foe oconnell stood in a byelection to the british house of commons in  for county clare for a seat vacated by william vesey fitzgerald another supporter of the catholic association after oconnell won election he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the oath of supremacy which was incompatible with catholicism the prime minister the duke of wellington and the home secretary sir robert peel even though they opposed catholic participation in parliament saw that denying oconnell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in ireland which was about  catholic peel and wellington managed to convince george iv that catholic emancipation and the right of catholics and presbyterians and members of all christian faiths other than the established church of ireland to sit in parliament needed to be established with the help of the whigs it became law in  however the emancipation act was not made retrospective meaning that oconnell had either to seek reelection or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy when oconnell attempted on  may to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy solicitorgeneral nicholas conyngham tindal moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered oconnell was elected unopposed on  july  he took his seat when parliament resumed in february  by which time henry charles howard th duke of norfolk and earl of surrey had already become the first roman catholic to have taken advantage of the emancipation act and sit in parliament wellington is the king of england king george iv once complained oconnell is king of ireland and i am only the dean of windsor the regal jest expressed the general admiration for oconnell at the height of his career the catholic emancipation campaign led by oconnell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of british jews the subsequent jews relief act  allowing jewish mps to omit the words in the oath of allegiance and i make this declaration upon the true faith of a christian the tithe waredit daniel oconnell as depicted on the £ note of series c banknote of ireland ironically considering oconnells dedication to peaceful methods of political agitation his greatest political achievement ushered in a period of violence in ireland there was an obligation for those working the land to support the established church ie the united church of england and ireland by payments known as tithes the fact that the vast majority of those working the land in ireland were catholic or presbyterian tenant farmers supporting what was a minority religion within that island but not the united kingdom as a whole had been causing tension for some time in december  he and several others were tried for holding a meeting as an association or assemblage in violation of the orders of the lord lieutenant of ireland but the statute expired in course of judgment and the prosecution was terminated by the judiciary an initially peaceful campaign of nonpayment turned violent in  when the newly founded irish constabulary were used to seize property in lieu of payment resulting in the tithe war of – although opposed to the use of force oconnell successfully defended participants in the battle of carrickshock and all the defendants were acquitted nonetheless oconnell rejected william sharman crawfords call for the complete abolition of tithes in  as he felt he could not embarrass the whigs the lichfield house compact secured an alliance between whigs radicals and irish mps in  in  daniel oconnell became the first roman catholic lord mayor of dublin since the reign of james ii who had been the last roman catholic monarch of england ireland and scotland campaign for repeal of the unionedit oconnell monument on oconnell street in dublin once catholic emancipation was achieved oconnell campaigned for repeal of the act of union which in  had merged the parliaments of the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland to campaign for repeal oconnell set up the repeal association he argued for the recreation of an independent kingdom of ireland to govern itself with queen victoria as the queen of ireland to push for this he held a series of monster meetings throughout much of ireland outside the protestant and unionistdominated province of ulster they were so called because each was attended by around  people these rallies concerned the british government and the prime minister sir robert peel banned one such proposed monster meeting at clontarf county dublin just outside dublin city in  this move was made after the biggest monster meeting was held at tara tara held great significance to the irish population as it was the historic seat of the high kings of ireland clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the battle of clontarf in  when the irish king brian boru defeated his rival maelmordha although brian himself died during the battle despite appeals from his supporters oconnell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others he was arrested charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a years imprisonment and a fine of £ although he was released after three months by the house of lords which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial having deprived himself of his most potent weapon the monster meeting oconnell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the repeal association legacyedit daniel oconnell is honoured on the first commemorative stamps of ireland issued in  the round tower marking oconnells mausoleum mausoleum of daniel oconnell in glasnevin cemetery oconnell died of softening of the brain cerebral softening in  in genoa italy while on a pilgrimage to rome at the age of  his term in prison had seriously weakened him and the appallingly cold weather he had to endure on his journey was probably the final blow according to his dying wish his heart was buried in rome at santagata dei goti then the chapel of the irish college and the remainder of his body in glasnevin cemetery in dublin beneath a round tower his sons are buried in his crypt on  august  charles herbert mackintosh won the gold and silver medals offered by the st patricks society during the oconnell centenary at majors hill park in ottawa ontario for a prize poem entitled the irish liberator oconnells philosophy and career have inspired leaders all over the world including mahatma gandhi – and martin luther king – he was told by william makepeace thackeray – you have done more for your nation than any man since washington ever did william gladstone – described him as the greatest popular leader the world has ever seen honoré de balzac – wrote that napoleon and oconnell were the only great men the th century had ever seen jeanhenri merle daubigné – wrote that the only man like luther in the power he wielded was oconnell william grenville – wrote that history will speak of him as one of the most remarkable men that ever lived oconnell met befriended and became a great inspiration to frederick douglass – a former american slave who became a highly influential leader of the abolitionist movement social reformer orator writer and statesman oconnells attacks on slavery were made with his usual vigour and often gave great offence especially in the united states he called george washington a hypocrite and was challenged to a duel by andrew stevenson the american minister whom he was reported to have called a slave breeder however the founder of the irish labour party and executed easter rising leader james connolly devoted a chapter in his  book labour in irish history entitled a chapter of horrors daniel o’connell and the working class in which he criticised oconnells parliamentary record accusing him of siding consistently with the interests of the propertied classes of the united kingdom and patrick pearse connollys fellow leader of the easter rising wrote the leaders in ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment o’connell recoiled before the cannon at clontarf though adding i do not blame these men you or i might have done the same it is a terrible responsibility to be cast on a man that of bidding the cannon speak and the grapeshot pour in oconnells lifetime the aims of his repeal association—an independent kingdom of ireland governing itself but keeping the british monarch as its head of state—proved too radical for the british government of the time to accept and brought upon oconnell persecution and suppression oconnell is known in ireland as the liberator or the great emancipator for his success in achieving catholic emancipation oconnell admired latin american liberator simón bolívar and one of his sons morgan oconnell was a volunteer officer in bolívars army in  aged  the principal street in the centre of dublin previously called sackville street was renamed oconnell street in his honour in the early th century after the irish free state came into being his statue made by the sculptor john henry foley who also designed the sculptures of the albert memorial in london stands at one end of the street with a statue of charles stewart parnell at the other end the main street of limerick is also named after oconnell also with a statue at the end in the centre of the crescent oconnell streets also exist in ennis sligo athlone kilkee clonmel and waterford there is a statue honouring oconnell outside st patricks cathedral in melbourne australia as until the s the archdiocese of melbourne was almost entirely made up of irish immigrants or australians of irish descent there is a museum commemorating him in derrynane house near the village of derrynane county kerry which was once owned by his family he was a member of the literary association of the friends of poland as well familyedit  portrait of daniel oconnell by george hayter in  oconnell married his third cousin mary oconnell it was a love marriage and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage since daniels uncle maurice was outraged as mary had no fortune and for a time threatened to disinherit them they had four daughters three surviving ellen – catherine  elizabeth  and rickard  and four sons the sons—maurice  morgan  john  and daniel —all sat in parliament the marriage was happy and marys death in  was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered he was a devoted father ofaoláin suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him connection with the licensed tradeedit oconnell assisted his younger son daniel junior to acquire the phoenix brewery in jamess street dublin in  the brewery produced a brand known as oconnells ale and enjoyed some popularity by  oconnell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his sons company until he was no longer a member of parliament particularly because oconnell and arthur guinness were political enemies guinness was the moderate liberal candidate oconnell was the radical liberal candidate the rivalry caused dozens of irish firms to boycott guinness during the  repeal election it was at this time that guinness was accused of supporting the orange system and its beer was known as protestant porter when the oconnell family left brewing the rights to oconnell dublin ale was sold to john darcy the brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though and after a few years was taken over by the manager john brennan while daniel junior embraced a political career brennan changed the name back to the phoenix brewery but continued to brew and sell oconnells ale when the phoenix brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the guinness complex in  the brewing of oconnells ale was carried out by john darcy and son ltd at the anchor brewery in usher street in  darcys ceased trading and the firm of watkins jameson and pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with guinness daniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to daniel oconnell in his public life some time later a quarrel arose and oconnell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of temperance during the period of fr mathews total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held the most notable being a huge rally held on st patricks day in  daniel oconnell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the rotunda hospital comments on emancipationedit oconnell is on the left edge in this painting which is of the  world antislavery convention move your cursor to identify him or click icon to enlarge michael doheny in his the felons track says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an exaggerated and false guise and that it is an error to call it emancipation he went on that it was neither the first nor the last nor even the most important in the concessions which are entitled to the name of emancipation and that no one remembered the men whose exertions wrung from the reluctant spirit of a far darker time the right of living of worship of enjoying property and exercising the franchise dohenys opinion was that the penalties of the penal laws had been long abolished and that barbarous code had been compressed into cold and stolid exclusiveness and yet mr oconnell monopolised its entire renown the view put forward by john mitchel also one of the leading members of the young ireland movement in his jail journal was that there were two distinct movements in ireland during this period which were rousing the people one was the catholic relief agitation led by oconnell which was both open and legal the other was the secret societies known as the ribbon and white—boy movements the first proposed the admission of professional and genteel catholics to parliament and to the honours of the professions all under british law—the other originating in an utter horror and defiance of british law contemplated nothing less than a social and ultimately a political revolution according to mitchel for fear of the latter great britain with a very ill grace yielded to the first mitchel agrees that sir robert peel and the duke of wellington said they brought in this measure to avert civil war but says that no british statesman ever officially tells the truth or assigns to any act its real motive their real motive was according to mitchel to buy into the british interests the landed and educated catholics these respectable catholics would then be contented and become west britons from that day political beliefs and programmeedit daniel oconnell the champion of liberty poster published in pennsylvania  a critic of violent insurrection in ireland oconnell once said that the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood and yet as late as  oconnell had whipped his mps into line to keep the opium war going in china the tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war and oconnell had to call upon his mps to support the whig government as a result of this intervention the government was saved politically he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the british crown he often warned the british establishment that if they did not reform the governance of ireland irishmen would start to listen to the counsels of violent men successive british governments continued to ignore this advice long after his death although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted ie eliminating disabilities on roman catholics ensuring that lawfully elected roman catholics could serve their constituencies in the british parliament until the irish parliament was restored and amending the oath of allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to roman catholics who could then take the oath in good conscience although a native speaker of the irish language oconnell encouraged irish people to learn english to better themselves although he is best known for the campaign for catholic emancipation he also supported similar efforts for irish jews at his insistence in  the british law de judaismo which prescribed a special dress for jews was repealed oconnell said ireland has claims on your ancient race it is the only country that i know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the jews feud with disraeliedit in april  misled by inaccurate press reports oconnell thought disraeli had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him his name shows that he is of jewish origin i do not use it as a term of reproach there are many most respectable jews but there are as in every other people some of the lowest and most disgusting grade of moral turpitude and of those i look upon mr disraeli as the worst he has just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the cross and i verily believe if mr disraelis family herald were to be examined and his genealogy traced the same personage would be discovered to be the heir at law of the exalted individual to whom i allude i forgive mr disraeli now and as the lineal descendant of the blasphemous robber who ended his career beside the founder of the christian faith i leave the gentleman to the enjoyment of his infamous distinction and family honours disraeli sought satisfaction by challenging oconnells son morgan to a duel daniel having sworn never to duel again after previously killing a man morgan declined replying he was not responsible for his fathers words oconnell quotationsedit oconnnells last wish wikiquote has
