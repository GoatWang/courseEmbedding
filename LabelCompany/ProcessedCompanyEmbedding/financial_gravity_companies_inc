contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from managements expectations see the sections entitled forwardlooking statements and risk factors above plan of operations financial gravity companies inc based in allen texas was formed specifically to be the parent company of several subsidiaries that provide integrated tax business and financial solutions financial gravitys clients include small businesses small business owners and high net worth individuals the companys services are focused on helping clients make more money and build wealth most often with tax savings lowering costs and improving efficiency in addition to expanding through client procurement and organic growth financial gravity intends to make a number of acquisitions the primary acquisition targets currently include accounting bookkeeping financial advisory firms in fiscal year  the company acquired two firms cloud holdings company and its subsidiary cloudbb which became financial gravity business and mdp a tulsa ok payroll processor in fiscal year  the company acquired tax coach software the company is actively identifying additional potential acquisition candidates to fuel more rapid growth financial gravitys subsidiaries financial gravity operations inc this entity was created to raise capital to take the company public it will be eliminated now that the public transaction is complete this entity integrates the delivery of financial gravity tax business and wealth solutions to our growing customer base around the country this integration impossible to do for the small business marketplace until now is what sets financial gravity apart from our peers this integration will now be handled by financial gravity companies inc financial gravity tax financial gravity has developed a precise procedure that has proven to be very successful in delivering lower taxes higher profit and greater wealth for small business owners the process begins with an extensive and comprehensive review of the clients needs this assessment sets the requirements for the program that is subsequently developed next financial gravity designs a unique tax blueprintr which identifies several strategies for lowering the clients taxes the second step is to use the clients custom tax blueprintr to build that business entity and documentation that captures the identified savings this is called their tax operating systemr tos this process is repeated as required and tuned for optimal efficiency thus ensuring that the client receives the best service and optimal solutions in the phases of the business cycle during the year clients continue to pay a monthly or weekly subscription fee as part of their tos service for ongoing tax planning tax return preparation payroll and bookkeeping services this business unit promises clients theyll pay the lowest legal moral and ethical taxes possible tax savings is the tip of the spear in all our offerings no company has ever successfully married tax wealth and business solutions together for small business owners sbos and high net worth individuals powered by our norisk x promise we guarantee to find double our initial fee in tax savings clients are quick to sign up for proactive tax planning lowering their personal tax expenses then fuels insurance wealth and business services sales these multitiered sales provide a  times multiple to a typical accounting or bookkeeping practice sbos look for two things from a typical cpa and bookkeeping firm  lower personal income taxes  numbers that help them rungrow their business better there is no national firm that provides these two services at any level our tax planning sets us apart from typical accounting and tax preparation firms we look forward to setting up a clients business to be tax efficient the typical service model employed by cpa firms is oriented more toward compliance which is the recording of historical data these providers work on historical records instead of looking forward to proactively plan sbos are growing more and more frustrated with accountants who put numbers in boxes when whats truly needed is a partner to help advise them in how to be more efficient in their business many sbos cant read an pl or balance sheet and even when the can the data is too old to act on as technology speeds up the pace of business real time data is becoming more important most cpas dont even calculate tax savings for their clients asking them to produce unique data to each client is outside the factory mentality of the industry our average tax savings is over  per year per business owner financial gravity tax is pursuing several ma andor partnership opportunities to deliver on the product bookkeeping with purposer that will help deliver the promised tax savings and producer actionable real time data financial gravity wealth after saving thousands in taxes clients are happy to trust us with managing their wealth especially when treated to a different wealth management experience financial gravity wealth is a registered investment advisory ria firm an ria is an advisor or firm engaged in financial planning and wealth management business and is registered either with the securities and exchange commission sec or state securities authorities an ria has a fiduciary duty to his or her clients which means that he or she has a fundamental obligation to provide suitable investment advice and always act in the clients best interests the recent regulatory changes where the department of labor was given power over retirement accounts enhances the rias fiduciary model over the traditional brokerdealer suitability standard while the status of this department of labor rule is uncertain following the election we are positioned to do what we have always done control advisor fees and reduce one of the biggest fees in a mutual fund and etf portfolio which is tax friction these taxes erode about  per year in performance only  of all financial planners are rias  prefer the higher fees and commissions paid to brokers and brokerdealers the advantage of the ria model is lower cost to the client also since rias are not compensated by commissions on financial products their advice is considered less biased and more accurate coupled with tax savings this makes our firm very attractive to the most profitable clients financial gravity business the complexity of advanced tax planning next fuels financial gravity business services the first product that was developed with a partner is advisor architect this product is designed to help financial advisors and accountants run their businesses better we intend to test the service offering  coaching program with the first two markets we are the most experienced with and then roll it out to other industries at a later date clients spend some of their tax savings from financial gravity tax planning for these services rendering them cost neutral we have also developed our partner programs that teach financial advisors how to serve an underserved community the small business owner financial gravity business is the only nonproduct centric business system for financial advisors that helps them serve the needs of the small business owner without needing to sell a financial services product like a life insurance policy or a k to solve the industry problem discussed in the financial gravity tax section we have created the certified tax masterr designation and partner program for cpas and eas we expect to roll this out in early  there is no business like this of its kind this was created in financial gravity business but will be sold and build revenue in the tax coach software platform financial gravity ventures employs our ma strategy to acquire talent and build wealth for financial gravity companies inc and acquired companies as mentioned earlier financial gravity is pursuing several opportunities tax coach software tax coach software tcs was a key acquisition in fiscal year  tcs supports over  cpa and enrolled agent professionals training them to add crucial tax planning services to support its clients not only did this acquisition bring highend tax planning to financial gravity but the tcs customer base adds significant business development opportunities for financial gravity wealth we developed the certified tax masterr for this group and rolled out new client systems in mid sash corporation sash corporation dba metro data processing was the companys

business significant effort and investment capital has been incurred by the company over the past few years in order to attract and maintain a qualified and capable staff develop proprietary solutions and implement systems procedures and infrastructure to execute the business plan on a large scale given the short time frame this current market opportunity has existed and due to the complexity of the model we have a significant competitive advantage over others who may try to execute the same business plan results of operations for the year ended september   compared to the year ended
