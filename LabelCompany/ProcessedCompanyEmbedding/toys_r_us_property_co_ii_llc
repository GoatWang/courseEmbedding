street toys r us bondholders retain moelis to advise on refinancing lisa allen sep    am edt new york  the deal  certain toys r us inc bondholders have hired advisers to promote their interests as the toy retailer works out its debt refinancing plan a group of investors holding  senior holding company notes due  has retained moelis  co llc to represent it in the refinancing discussions a source familiar with the situation said right now there is a difference in opinions between the private equitybacked company and its  bondholders about the priorities in a refinancing the source explained the dispute with the  holders centers on a covenant in their bond indenture that limits what toys r us can pledge as security for new debt offerings which would prevent the retailer from using the value of its real estate to secure new debt the  noteholders are trying to monetize the value of that covenant the source said explaining that they want some sort of benefit or premium for removing it one potential benefit for the  holders could be a structural move from the holdco level to unit toys r usdelaware inc the source said but the source also noted the company isnt sold on the need to give those parties a premium to remove the covenant the source anticipated toys r us is likely to refinance its debt due  before the holiday season and leave furtherout maturities to deal with later the  maturities include  million in  senior secured notes due sept   and a  million secured term loan facility a lot is riding on the companys performance during the fourth quarter since holiday toy sales are a key indicator of how the retailer is holding up in the face of competition from online retailers and behemoth walmart stores inc which has been amping up its presence in the toy space if the  holiday season goes badly for toys r us then gaining the ability to use the value of its real estate to secure new debt could become a higher priority the source said the person noted that toys r us decision to release secondquarter results early on aug  was very unusual sources see that move as a sign the company is looking to take action on its refinancing sooner rather than later sources also have perceived the companys summer hirings of new cfo michael j short and new treasurer chetan bhandari formerly a managing director at investment banking and restructuring firm glc advisors  co llc as signs that the refinancing process is heating up the early earnings release also could have been a way to give current investors access to key financial information without requiring them to go restricted the source noted the company on wednesday sept  filed its form q for the quarter ended aug  with the securities and exchange commission an aug  statement highlighted improvements in adjusted ebitda  million compared with  million during the same quarter last year and positive comparablestore sales results an inventory clearance effort however contributed to a decline in the companys margins toys r us reported a net loss of  million during the second quarter compared with a net loss of  million during the same quarter in  an increase it blames on higher income taxes the
