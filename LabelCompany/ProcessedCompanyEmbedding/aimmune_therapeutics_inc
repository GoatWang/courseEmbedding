address a growing unmet medical needaimmune therapeutics was created in response to a united call to action from an assembly of the leading minds and key stakeholders in food allergy in april  the food allergy initiative fai then the largest private funder of food allergy research brought together  of the most noted experts and contributors to the field of food allergy for a research retreat at harvard medical school the objective of the retreat was to reach consensus on the direction of food allergy researchat this landmark event prominent academic researchers senior government officials and industry and advocacy leaders agreed that safe effective fdaapproved treatments to address the growing problem of food allergies were within reach among the outcomes of the meeting the group concluded that there needed to be a large phase  registration trial of oral immunotherapy oit — which had been explored since the beginning of the th century — to establish a validated optimized oit product and protocolbut such an effort was beyond the scope and resources of academic researchers or nonprofits — it needed to happen in the professional realm of the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry dr bryan walser who had facilitated the retreat as a consultant for fai sought a corporate partner for the development work to support a trial but none emergedultimately dr walser drew from his biotech experience to put together allergen research corporation or arc now aimmune in  dedicated to oit drug development researchers from duke university the university of arkansas and stanford university also played key roles in getting the company started by licensing their data from important oit studiesin  fai merged with the food allergy  anaphylaxis network faan the most trusted source of food allergy information programs and resources to form food allergy research and education fare the nation’s leading nonprofit focused on food allergieswith a mission of ensuring the safety and inclusion of individuals with food allergies while relentlessly seeking a cure fare invested the seed money to found arc and used its extensive network to generate a total investment of m from fare and several high networth individuals connected to food allergies this funding allowed arc to advance studies of oit sufficiently to attract our first institutional investor longitude capital to complete a m series a financing and execute on a phase  clinical trial of oit for peanut allergy in  along with the successful completion of our phase  study we closed an  million series b

enrollment of its first patient in the european phase  artemis arc clinical trial of ar for treatment of peanut allergy ar is aimmune’s investigational biologic oral immunotherapy for desensitization of patients with peanut allergy the randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled artemis ar trial in europe measuring oral immunotherapy success clinical trial of ar will enroll approximately  peanutallergic children and adolescents ages  at multiple sites in several european countries the artemis trial follows aimmune’s ongoing phase  palisade trial taking place in eight countries in europe the united states and canada aimmune designed the artemis trial to expand the data on the level of and speed to clinically meaningful modulation of the immune response to ar treatment the primary efficacy endpoint for artemis is tolerating a mg single dose of peanut protein the equivalent of approximately three to four peanut kernels in a progressive exit doubleblind placebocontrolled food challenge dbpcfc after approximately nine months of treatment the enrollment criteria for artemis allow inclusion of peanutallergic patients who react to  mg or less of peanut protein in an entry dbpcfc aimmune therapeutics presents european phase  palisade screening data jun   aimmune therapeutics inc reported findings from prerandomization preliminary clinical data collected from the european screening population of the palisade trial in aimmune’s ar program in addition the company reported observations from a survey on current management and use of oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy across western europe the data were presented at the  european academy of allergy and clinical immunology eaaci congress in helsinki aimmune presented a preliminary dataset of  patients in europe who underwent a screening doubleblind placebocontrolled food challenge dbpcfc to determine eligibility for the palisade trial  ages –  ages – and  ages –  male the dbpcfc allowed a progression of doses of peanut protein up to a dose of  mg  mg  mg  mg  mg and  mg patients who reacted with doselimiting symptoms at or before the mg dose “reactors” were eligible for randomization into the trial observations from preliminary evaluable baseline characteristics results from these patients included the following  of the subjects screened were reactors who experienced doselimiting symptoms in the dbpcfc at or before the mg dose median   mg dose meaning a cumulative amount of  mg peanut protein  were “nonreactors” who consumed all doses in the dbpcfc with no doselimiting symptoms reactors had a statistically significant larger peanut skinprick test spt wheal diameters a higher peanutspecific ige psige and higher ara h –specific ige than nonreactors ara h –specific ige demonstrated greatest sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between reactors and nonreactors based on receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis of the data spt peanutspecific ige and ara h  were not associated with the severity of reactions during the screening dbpcfc aimmune also presented the results from a survey of physicians across six western european countries who offer oral immunotherapy to peanutallergic patients interviews with  physicians revealed substantial variability in approaches for peanut oral immunotherapy within and across european countries showing that there is currently no standardized approach or product for peanut oral immunotherapy in europe aimmune therapeutics reports on updosing in its ongoing phase  palisade trial of ar for peanut allergy jun   aimmune therapeutics inc announced that in the ongoing phase  palisade trial of ar more than  of patients currently on study have completed updosing ar is aimmune’s proprietary investigational biologic oral immunotherapy for desensitization of patients with peanut allergy palisade is a doubleblind placebocontrolled trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ar in peanutallergic children adolescents and adults a total of  peanutallergic patients ages  were randomized to receive either ar or placebo for approximately six months of updosing followed by six months of maintenance therapy aimmune remains blinded to data from the trial based on observations of aggregated data to date aimmune expects that the percentage of patients completing the entire study updosing and maintenance will be well ahead of the powering calculations behind the study design with the vast majority of patients now successfully through updosing in palisade aimmune estimates that

be required by law we assume no obligation to update these forwardlooking statements or the reasons that results could differ from these forwardlooking statements overview we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach including the development of proprietary product candidates for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies it is estimated that over  million people in the united states and europe have a food allergy with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and lifethreatening events there are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance when accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction rescue therapies such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine are the only recourse available our therapeutic approach which we refer to as characterized oral desensitization immunotherapy or codittm is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur codit is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by foodallergic patients and their families our lead codit product candidate ar is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy which affects approximately three million patients in the united states and three million patients in europe ar has received fast track and breakthrough therapy designations for the treatment of patients  years from the united states food and drug administration or fda our initial target patient population is in children and adolescents in the  age group which we estimate will reach approximately  million patients in the united states alone by  we have completed a doubleblind placebocontrolled phase  trial of ar in  patients ages  years have analyzed longerterm safety and efficacy data from our ongoing openlabel phase  trial and have received feedback from regulatory authorities including the fda and the european medicines agency or ema providing guidance on our phase  program in late  we initiated a phase  registration trial of ar in the united states canada and europe which we refer to as the palisade peanut allergy oral immunotherapy study of ar for desensitization in children and adults trial we completed global enrollment of  patients ages  in november  and anticipate completing the palisade trial around yearend  we have begun to enroll eligible patients who have completed palisade into a related openlabel phase  rollover trial which we refer to as the arc trial we expect to begin enrolling a realworld experience trial of ar in the united states and canada in patients ages  in the second quarter of  which we refer to as the ramses realworld ar marketsupporting experience study in peanut allergic children ages  years trial in addition we expect to initiate a european trial in the middle of  designed with a higher efficacy bar in the same age group which we refer to as the artemis ar trial in europe measuring oral immunotherapy success trial based on discussions with the fda in the beginning of  we anticipate that the safety database for a biologics license application or bla will need to include data from at least  patients ages  treated with ar at the target maintenance dose of  mg per day we expect to meet this requirement with patients from the palisade arc and ramses trials in europe we expect that data from the palisade arc and artemis trials will form the basis for a marketing authorization application or maa filing with the european medicines agency or ema we expect to have topline data from our palisade trial around yearend  and intend to file a bla in the united states and an maa in the european union in late  we maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates including ar and if approved currently intend to commercialize in the united states and europe with our own specialty sales force calling on allergists in the united states and allergyfocused clinicians in major european markets since commencing our operations in  substantially all of our efforts have been focused on research development and the advancement of our lead codit product candidate ar we have not generated any revenue from product sales and as a result we have incurred significant losses we incurred net losses of  million  million and  million for the years ended december    and  respectively as of december   our accumulated deficit was  million we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development of seek regulatory approval for and begin to commercialize ar and as we develop other product candidates we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of obtain regulatory approval for and begin to commercialize one or more of our product candidates which we expect will take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty accordingly we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our future operations until such time that we can generate substantial revenue from product sales if ever we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings and we may seek to raise additional capital through strategic collaborations however we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay limit reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop or market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations in part or in full furthermore even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations we currently utilize contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing activities in june  we entered into a lease for a manufacturing facility in clearwater florida we anticipate that this manufacturing facility will be operational by the end of  we plan to continue to rely on the contract manufacturer that is located at the same site to manage the operations of this new manufacturing facility additionally we currently utilized specialized clinical vendors clinical trial sites consultants and clinical research organizations or cros to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and we do not yet have a sales organization we expect to significantly increase our investment in costs relating to our manufacturing process and sales organization as we prepare for the filing of a bla with the fda and a maa with the ema and prepare for a possible commercial launch of ar recent developments equity investment and strategic collaboration on november   we entered into a securities purchase agreement the purchase agreement with nestle health science us holdings inc nestle health science pursuant to which we issued and sold  shares the shares of our common stock par value  to nestle health science in a private placement at a price of  per share or aggregate cash purchase price of  million the shares represented  of our outstanding common stock after giving effect to the issuance of the shares upon closing in connection with the closing of the sale and issuance of the shares on november   we entered into a registration rights agreement and standstill agreement with nestle health science in connection with the purchase agreement on november   we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement the strategic collaboration agreement with nestec ltd a limited company organized and existing under the laws of switzerland nestec nestec and nestle health science are affiliates of swiss food and wellness company nestle sa pursuant to the strategic collaboration agreement we and nestec through itself and one or more affiliated entities agreed to collaborate with one another in connection with the development of our products including by i sharing information relating to our activities directed towards the development of our products for the treatment of allergies to one or more particular types of food the development programs and ii providing us access to nestecs scientific clinical regulatory and commercial expertise relevant to such development programs the strategic collaboration agreement became effective upon the closing of the equity investment we evaluated the equity purchase agreement and strategic collaboration agreement and determined that the equity purchase by nestle health science was at fair value and therefore we accounted for the equity component under the equity purchase agreement separately from the strategic collaboration agreement the collaboration is not deemed to be a revenue generating transaction and no accounting was required critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item  of this annual report on form k accrued research and development costs we record expenses for our research and development activities conducted by thirdparty service providers which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided and work completed but not yet invoiced and in accordance with agreements established with these thirdparty service providers we include these costs in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses we estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreedupon fee to be paid for such services we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period as actual costs become known we adjust our accrued estimates although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred our understanding of the status and timing of services performed the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period our accrued expenses are dependent in part upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other thirdparty service providers to date there have been no material differences from our accrued expenses to actual expenses stockbased compensation we recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the grant date fair value using the blackscholes optionpricing model the grant date fair value of the stockbased awards is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards we recorded stockbased compensation expense of  million  million and  million for the years ended december    and  respectively prior to our ipo the fair value of our shares of common stock underlying the stock options was the responsibility of and determined by our board of directors or the board because there was no public market for our common stock the board determined the fair value of common stock at the time of grant of the option by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including independent thirdparty valuations of our common stock sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties operating and financial performance the lack of liquidity of our capital stock and general and industry specific economic outlook amongst other factors following our ipo the market traded price of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options is the closing price of our stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market on the grant date in determining the fair value of the stockbased awards used to calculate stockbased compensation expense we use the blackscholes optionpricing model and assumptions discussed below some of these inputs are subjective and require judgment to determine expected term the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to be outstanding we have opted to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term as provided by the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin or sab  as our options grants are considered plain vanilla the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average timetovesting and the contractual life of the options we plan to continue to use the simplified method under sab  until we have sufficient exercise history as a publicly traded company expected volatility the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers as we have limited trading history for our common stock industry peers consist of several public companies in the biopharmaceutical industry with comparable characteristics including enterprise value risk profiles and position within the industry we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation riskfree interest rate the riskfree interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zerocoupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option expected dividend yield we have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock therefore we used an expected dividend yield of zero for all years presented the weightedaverage assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option valuation model and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted were as follows year ended december     expected volatility       riskfree interest rate       expected dividend yield    expected term in years    weighted average grant date fair value       in addition to the blackscholes assumptions we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors the impact from any forfeiture rate adjustment would be recognized in full in the period of adjustment and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from our estimates we might be required to record adjustments to stockbased compensation in future periods we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility expected terms and forfeiture rates utilized for our stockbased compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis as of december   we had  million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over an estimated weightedaverage period of  years for stock option awards subject to ratable vesting we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the service period for the entire award in future periods our stockbased compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized stockbased compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional stockbased awards to attract and retain our employees income taxes we recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes we periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence which includes our historical operating performance reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the federal and state deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance as of december   we had generated net operating loss or nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of  million and for california income tax purposes of  million these federal and state nol carryforwards will begin to expire in  if not utilized our ability to utilize nol carryforwards or other tax attributes such as research tax credits in any taxable year may be limited if we have experienced an ownership change under section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code following issuance of the series b convertible preferred stock in january and february  we performed a preliminary section  analysis and believe that we experienced multiple ownership changes prior to june   and as a result such federal and state nol carryforwards and our tax credits are subject to limitation we have not performed a section  analysis to evaluate whether or not we experienced an ownership change as a result of either our august  ipo or the november  equity investment by nestle health science we record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to deferred tax assets offset by a change to valuation allowance in the period in which new information is available tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized upon effective settlement recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in november  the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued accounting standards update or asu  statement of cash flows  restricted cash topic  which establishes that the statement of cash flows will show the changes in cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash as a result entities will no longer have to determine how to classify transfers to and from restricted cash within the statement of cash flows an entity will be required to reconcile the total cash cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash on the statement of cash flows to the amounts in the balance sheet and disclose the nature of any restrictions on its cash cash equivalents or amounts generally described as restricted cash this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted we have not yet adopted asu  but we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures in october  the fasb issued asu  income taxes topic  in august  the fasb issued asu  statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments which will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning after

as either equity or liabilities classification on the statement of cash flows and accounting for forfeitures the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted we do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases topic  which requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease a lessee is also required to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than  months regardless of their classification leases with a term of  months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases the standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial statements and related disclosures however since we are lessee to certain leases for property whose terms exceed twelve months we expect to report assets and liabilities related to these leases on our financial statements that have not been previously reported once
