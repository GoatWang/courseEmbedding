effects throughout the world by william w sanger m d egypt was famous for her courtesans before the time of herodotus egyptian blood runs warm girls are nubile at ten under the pharaohs if ancient writers are to be believed there existed a general laxity of moral principle especially among young females their religion was only too suggestive the deities isis and osiris were the types of the sexes a statue of the latter a male image made of gold was carried by the maidens at festivals and worshiped by the whole people nor were the rites of isis more modest at the festival at bubastis says herodotus men and women go thither in boats on the nile and when the boats approach a city they are run close to the shore a frantic contest then begins between the women of the city and those in the boats each abusing the other in the most opprobrious language and the women in the boats conclude the performance by lascivious dances in the most undisguised manner in sight of the people and to the sound of flutes and other musical instruments there is little reason to doubt that the temples like those of baal were houses of prostitution on an extensive scale herodotus remarks significantly that a law in egypt forbade sexual intercourse within the walls of a temple and exacted of both sexes that intercourse should be followed by ablution before the temple was entered where piety required such sacrifices it is not surprising that public morals were loose it was not considered wholly shameful for an egyptian to make his living by the hire of his daughters person and a king is mentioned who resorted to this plan in order to discover a thief such was the astonishing appetite of the men that young and beautiful women were never delivered to the embalmer until they had been dead some days a miserable wretch having been detected in the act of defiling a recentlydeceased virgin of course in such a society there was no disgrace in being a prostitute the city of naucratis owed its wealth and fame to the beauty of its courtesans whose reputation spread throughout europe and was much celebrated in greece rhadopis a thracian by birth led the life of a prostitute in egypt with such success that she not only bought her own freedom from the slavedealer who had taken her there on speculation but if the egyptians are to be believed built a pyramid with her savings a large portion of her story is doubtless mythical but enough remains to warrant the opinion that she was though a prostitute a wealthy and highly considered person history of prostitution prostitution commercial sex whore
