mexico us and pemex activity offshore drilling in the gulf of mexico us and pemex activity feb    international energy oil and gas   comments when the obama administration announced its new fiveyear leasing plans for us waters on january  the inclusion of a portion of the atlantic garnered most of the headlines however arguably the bigger news was the decision to make gulf of mexico lease sales region wide after all any leasing let alone drilling off the coasts of virginia north carolina south carolina or georgia is on an ifcomemaybe basis facing many interim hurdles that put it years in the future at best on the other hand beginning in  the us bureau of ocean energy management boem will hold two gulf of mexico sales annually that will offer all open blocks in the western and central planning areas plus the blocks not under moratorium in the eastern gulf pardon the pun but this is a sea change since the first fiveyear plan was launched in  gulf of mexico leases sales have been divided into western gulf and central gulf offerings with a lease sale for the more heavily protected and therefore lightly explored eastern gulf thrown in every so often for good measure with the exception of the yearandahalf disruption brought about by the macondo disaster in  central gulf sales were generally held in the spring followed by a western sale late in the summer more offshore drilling opportunities so what spurred the change in a word mexico the decision to offer all open blocks in one sale was made in light of energy reforms that are opening up licensing opportunities in mexican waters acknowledging that resources no doubt straddle both sides of the usmexico maritime boundary the boem decided to offer more frequent opportunities to bid on open outer continental shelf ocs blocks to facilitate crossborder exploration “this new approach will allow for boem to more effectively balance the sales while providing greater flexibility to industry to invest in the gulf particularly given the significant energy reforms recently adopted by the mexican government” said boem director abigail ross hopper mexico is finally poised to act the opening of mexico after three quarters of a century is the single largest event on the international ep horizon today even in the face of collapsing crude oil prices ironically mexico closed and locked its doors at precisely the same time the first offshore oil well was completed drilled from a freestanding platform a mile and a half from the louisiana coastline as opposed to overwater drilling conducted earlier in the decade

course has not escaped mexico’s attention it is no coincidence that the three light oil fields found to date in mexico’s deep waters – exploratus trion and maximino – are clustered on the perdido foldbelt within  miles south of shell’s perdido development which includes the great white tobago and trident fields when perdido began producing oil in  it was hailed as a “technological tour de

these lower tertiary light oil fields are big prizes with reserves estimated between  mmbo at trion to as much as  mmbo at exploratus up to  of trion and exploratus are said to be available as well as operatorship of exploratus in addition pemex may farm out equity in maximino while reserves estimates have yet to be released for maximino pemex has called it the “jewel in the crown” needless to say shell and its partners on the us side of the border – bp and chevron – are all said to be interested in addition to the opportunity to farm into these three discoveries the mexican government will hold a bid round this year that will include deepwater blocks tom liskey drillinginfo’s northern latin american manager said the call for bids for the deepwater tranche of blocks in the staggered round  process is expected to launch in march  with registration and data rooms opening in may  awards for the deepwater sector should begin in october  the us is not standing idle image source

bod spar and producing via  miles of new oil pipeline and  miles of gas pipeline located in the keathley canyon area lucius is about  miles north of the mexican boundary some  miles due east of perdido this portion of the lower tertiary trend is very active and in  anadarko made another big discovery about  miles south of lucius that discovery known as phobos is the first well drilled in the sigsbee escarpment first oil at lucius came only a month after chevron began production at jackst malo to the east in the walker ridge area in another recent development chevron bp and conocophillips on january  announced they will jointly develop several large oil discoveries – gila guadalupe and tiber – in the northwestern keathley canyon area all of this activity underlines the synergy that will be needed to exploit resources in mexican waters in addition to drilling and development on the us side there are a number of seismic surveys currently underway that span both sides of the
