chemistry biochemistry and nanoscience  the walt groups research effort employs optical fiber microarrays for the detection and analysis of single molecules single enzyme molecules are enclosed with fluorogenic substrate in an array of thousands of individually addressable microchambers etched into a glass optical fiber bundle the large array size provides excellent statistics the substrate turnover in the microchambers can be monitored with fluorescence microscopy the results of these experiments provide mechanistic insight into enzyme mechanisms in addition to these fundamental studies they have also developed single molecule methods for high sensitivity dna and protein detection in another project the walt lab is investigating the limits to creating highdensity sensing arrays containing thousands of microsensors and nanosensors and are preparing arrays to perform high density nucleic acid and protein analysis one application of this effort is an integrated diagnostic platform for performing medical diagnostics using saliva as a sample instead of blood the arrays can also be used to study living cells both as cell populations as well as individual cells and analyze the contents of individual cells by integrating microfluidics with single molecule detection they are also studying the behavior of large numbers of cells to understand the distribution of cell

university is worldrenowned for its pioneering work in fiberoptic microarray technology which is used in solving urgent biological problems such as the detection of infectious diseases diagnostics for cancer biomarkers and in answering fundamental questions on basic biological processes such as enzymology and protein folding fiber optic bundles are used in our lab to develop beadbased assays for early and noninvasive detection of breast cancer and infectious diseases in clinical and environmental samples the high density array of femtoliter wells that can be created on the fiber optic bundle enables us to trap and detect biomolecules at the attomolar am to femtomolar fm range enabling ultrasensitive measurements single molecule analysis technology such as fiber optic arrays and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy tirfm are used to study fundamental processes such as enzyme and nanoparticle catalysis protein conformational changes enzyme inhibition and substrate specificity of enzymes at the single molecule level the lab also focuses on developing microfluidic and optical trapping methods to enable an automated investigation of single molecules and single cells our laboratory investigates new ways to measure things explains prof david r walt we create very small arrays containing thousands of features—ten thousand features can easily fit on the head of

business wire cerulean appoints david r walt phd to board of directors september    am eastern daylight time cambridge massbusiness wirecerulean pharma inc nasdaqceru a clinical stage company developing nanoparticledrug conjugates ndcs today announced the appointment of david r walt phd to its board of directors effective as of september   “we are pleased to welcome david to the cerulean board” said christopher d t guiffre president  chief executive officer of cerulean “david is a remarkable scientist and a proven companybuilder he will be invaluable to cerulean as we continue to expand our pipeline of platformgenerated ndcs” “cerulean’s platform is compelling because its ndcs are designed to target tumors and spare healthy tissue” stated dr walt “ndcs preferentially concentrate chemotherapy in tumors and slowly release it from inside tumor cells i am excited to be part of a company with such an innovative approach to treating cancer and i look forward to working with the company as it creates and develops additional ndcs” dr walt is an accomplished entrepreneur and researcher dr walt is the founding scientist of illumina inc and quanterix corporation he is a director and chairman of the scientific advisory boards of both companies he also is a founder and director of ultivue inc he currently serves as university professor robinson professor of chemistry professor of biomedical engineering professor of genetics and professor of oral medicine at tufts university and he is a howard hughes medical institute professor he also is director of the tufts institute for innovation he has received numerous national and international awards and honors for his fundamental and applied work in the field of optical sensors microwell arrays and single molecule detection dr walt is a cochair of the board on chemical sciences and technology of the us national academy of sciences he is a member of the us national academy of engineering american academy of arts and sciences a fellow of the american institute for medical and biological engineering a fellow of the national academy of inventors and a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science dr walt received a bs in chemistry from the university of michigan and a phd in chemical biology from stony brook university about crlx crlx is a nanoparticledrug conjugate ndc designed to concentrate in tumors and slowly release its anticancer payload camptothecin inside tumor cells crlx inhibits topoisomerase  topo  which is involved in cellular replication and also inhibits hypoxiainducible factorα hifα which research suggests is a master regulator of cancer cell survival mechanisms crlx has shown activity in four different tumor types both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments crlx is in phase  clinical development and has been dosed in more than  patients the us fda has granted crlx orphan drug designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer and fast track designation in combination with avastin® in metastatic renal cell carcinoma about crlx crlx is a dynamically tumortargeted ndc designed to concentrate in tumors and slowly release its anticancer payload docetaxel inside tumor cells in preclinical studies crlx delivers up to  times more docetaxel into tumors compared to an equivalent milligram dose of commercially available docetaxel and was similar to or better than docetaxel in seven of seven animal models with a statistically significant survival benefit seen in five of those seven models in addition preclinical data show that crlx had lower toxicity than has been reported with docetaxel in similar preclinical studies crlx is currently in phase a clinical development about cerulean pharma the cerulean team is committed to improving treatment for people living with cancer we apply our dynamic tumor targeting platform to create a portfolio of ndcs designed to selectively attack tumor cells reduce toxicity by sparing the body’s normal cells and enable therapeutic combinations our first platformgenerated candidate crlx is in multiple clinical trials in combination with other cancer treatments all of which aim to unlock the power of combination therapy our second platformgenerated candidate crlx is in a phase a clinical trial for more information please visit wwwceruleanrxcom about cerulean’s dynamic tumor targeting™ platform cerulean’s dynamic tumor targeting platform creates ndcs that are designed to provide safer and more effective cancer treatments we believe our ndcs concentrate their anticancer payloads inside tumors while sparing normal tissue because they are small enough to pass through the “leaky” vasculature present in tumors but are too large to pass through the wall of healthy blood vessels once inside tumors our ndcs enter tumor cells where they slowly release anticancer payloads from within the tumor cells cautionary note on forward looking statements any statements in this press release about our future expectations plans and prospects including statements about the clinical development of our product candidates statements about our

acsanalchembpublication date web january  copyright   american chemical societyemail davidwalttuftseduabstractthe cell is the basic unit of biology and protein expression drives cellular function tracking protein expression in single cells enables the study of cellular pathways and behavior but requires methodologies sensitive enough to detect low numbers of protein molecules with a wide dynamic range to distinguish unique cells and quantify population distributions this study presents an ultrasensitive and automated approach for quantifying phenotypic responses with single cell resolution using single molecule array simoa technology we demonstrate how prostate specific antigen psa expression varies over several orders of magnitude between single prostate cancer cells and how psa expression shifts with genetic drift single cell simoa introduces a straightforward process that is capable of detecting both high and low protein expression levels this technique could be useful
