present danger to the economic future of united states of americaamerica for sale recaps the amazing sometimes incredible events leading up to the sale of esmark including intense pressure from the united steelworkers and the companys major public shareholder to make a decision not in the best interest of all shareholders it also analyzes the efforts by the esmark board of directors to observe its fiduciary duty details the companys “poison pill” effort to raise its sales price and describes the actions of leo gerard and ron bloom of the united steelworkers union—which led to some surprising alliances the authors—one esmarks president and vice chairman of the board the other an esmark director preeminent american economist and former university president—then provide their own
