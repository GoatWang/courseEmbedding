joe schenk  the cheat sheet the ☰ facebook twitter linkedin google home  interviews  the inner workings of prop shop first new york securities – with copresidents donald motschwiller and joe schenk damien hoffman  google more articles june   facebook twitter linkedin googleplus stumbleupon reddit most people don’t know what really goes on behind closed doors at a proprietary trading firm so we went to premier shop first new york securities to get some answers about the business and what they look for in prospective hires … damien hoffman gentlemen what exactly does first new york do joe schenk contrary to popular belief our business is proprietary trading not day trading though we may trade intraday we are not day traders our core business is a longshort equity book which is both domestic and international we trade commodities and macro vehicles such as global interest rates global forex and treasuries we trade fixed income both taxable and tax exempt we also get diversification by having approximately  or so independent decision makers damien tell me more about those decision makers how do you determine who will thrive in your firm donald motschwiller the type of talent we generally look for are people spinning out of a bulge bracket banking firm or hedge fund the people that make the most amount of sense for us are discretionary traders  our definition of a discretionary trader is somebody who sources his ideas sizes his ideas executes his ideas manages the risk of his ideas and most importantly has been paid for his ideas when we look for new traders we look for people that bring to the table another view another skill set another style another strategy we have an enormous amount of diversification at our firm we don’t deploy a firmwide strategy we don’t have group think we also look for people who have a repeatable strategy with good historical returns and scalability so we can add size and again our business is a bottom line business so the strategy has to be profitable so we are not a healthcare fund or a tech fund we do not run a balance sheet intensive fund or strategy liquidity drives our business we need to know “is the product exchange traded is the product liquid” all the products must be marked so we can get an accurate profitandloss statement we want the ability to get out of our inventory in a relatively short period of time without impacting the market place or impacting our own portfolio joe schenk and donald motschwiller damien do you like to see experience on a resume before letting a new trader put a piece of your book at risk joe the biggest form of risk management in the firm is the fact that we trade only our own capital so we don’t have public or private money — we just have our own money however our model is a nomoneyup model unlike many other prop shops traders don’t have their capital at risk while interviewing prospects we like to ask “where did you trade and how did you trade” we like to see people trading their own money i’m not saying the guys at bulge bracket banking firms or hedge funds are coy and cavalier about somebody else’s money but perhaps we might trade our money and our family’s money a little bit differently than somebody else’s money damien that seems very psychological is there a psychological profile that one needs to have or can successful trading be taught joe there’s a lot of correlation between successful traders and athletes a trader does better when they’ve been under pressure and could live with his or her performance if i were to guess how many of our traders were better than average athletes i would say it’s a pretty high percentage donald motschwiller it’s part of the commercial dna we look for if there was a guy who was an athlete in college in a very competitive environment which positively and negatively reinforced his actions and if he can take the negative reinforcement and return the next day looking to be better that person has what it takes to do well as a trader it takes a certain kind of candidate who is able to recognize that it’s a bottomline business and thrive on a daily basis in our business there is nowhere to hide so if damien is a trader here everyday damien knows what he made or what he lost everyday the firm knows what damien made or what damien lost you can’t hide on the desk if the desk does well but you’re doing poorly it’s not as if you’re working at a hedge fund or a banking firm where you’re reporting numbers on a monthly basis while intramonth you’re not doing well there’s also no netting risk so if damien is trading and donald is trading and donald messes up it doesn’t impact damien’s ability to get paid so in many instances at other shops a stellar performer’s pay may be mitigated by another sector or somebody else having a more challenging time joe a successful trader must also have a passion for the market then we look at academics and experiences we like people that have good strong mathematical skills we rely heavily upon our interviewing process which in many instances are four to five separate individuals that challenge the new person on a wide variety of professional and personal experiences donald the biggest difference between people who have success in our field versus those who have less success is the ability to take risk the first time you trade you react to a script if the stock makes a certain move over the course of the day if you’re reacting to what has already happened you’re going to capture a very small percentage of that move as you get better you start anticipating when you start anticipating you start capturing a larger percentage of that move but the guys who truly trade the markets the best — the most talented guys in the firm — they trade the markets intuitively they’ve seen it so many times and are so confident in the decision making process that they’re not reacting they’re not anticipating they’re just intuitively going about their business damien does that lead to a darwinian natural selection where you guys are constantly bringing in new talent and replacing talent that can’t necessarily cut it on that level of the game donald if the trader is as advertised i believe we are the best place on planet earth for that person over the past few years the talent pool has become much better so we have been upgrading the talent the turnover we experience is more an issue of guys coming in and just not being as advertised i don’t recall instances when people left the firm because they weren’t given enough money to run or they weren’t making a reasonable amount of money the trader here is paid in cash not in deferred comp or toxic assets here the trader gets a formulaic way of getting paid — so there’s no subjectivity of what he’s going to make therefore this is a very entrepreneurial shop if you’re somebody who is accustomed to and ready to stand by your performance this is a great place to be if your part of a big conglomerate and your department is up a couple of million but you’re down three and you still get paid that’s a whole different thing philosophically  this is definitely a place for entrepreneurs who have a lot of confidence in their ability it’s a pure meritocracy damien back tracking a tad how did you make the decision that traders would not use their own money donald over the past five years there have been dynamic changes in market place we believe capital gives us staying power and in order for the firm to really be profitable it has to have an economic model that gives the trader as well as the firm an opportunity to profit so we have a platform of seeding propriety traders our platform provides clearance execution technology and capital and you as a proprietary trader will come in here and bolt your business model onto our platform in moneyup models there is far less control the firm can have on the trader because the trader is going to take the perspective “it’s my money and i’m going to do what i want with my money since you don’t have the risk who are you to jiggle me out of positions when the market is going against me” also generally in the moneyup model most of the traders and firms are thinly capitalized and i would say our competitive advantage in the market place is the fact we are substantially capitalized damien does that imply individual retail traders are at a disadvantage donald it’s more and more difficult to make money as a day trader i still think there’s plenty of opportunity for eventdriven catalystdriven shortterm swing type of traders but the highvolume lowmargin day trader … that business is more and more challenging because that’s what the computers do and the computers can think move react and anticipate much quicker than an individual plus access to information has become much more commoditized thus it’s more difficult for the individual to get a leg up on the pros damien well don and joe thanks for
