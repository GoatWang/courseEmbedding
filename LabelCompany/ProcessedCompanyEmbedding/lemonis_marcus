periu president proximo llc mike is a seasoned executive with experience in finance and management he is the founder of proximo llc a leading provider of small business education and training services in both english and spanish mike periu is also a leading national voice for individual empowerment through financial education and entrepreneurship he has been interviewed over  times in national and international media including nbc univision and cnn the profit cnbc’s smallbusiness tv program starring entrepreneur marcus lemonis was just renewed for a second season the realitybased series follows lemonis as he invests  million of his own money in small businesses that are struggling but have the potential for success  lemonis couples his monetary investment with handson advice to the companies founders and employees if theres one person who was made for this type of show its lemonis hes the founder chair and ceo of camping worldgood sam a national retailer of recreational vehicles and related goods and services the company generates more than  billion per year in sales and employs over  people—not bad for someone who hasn’t yet turned  lemonis’ passion for business led him to become a successful angel investor and the profit gives us a glimpse of the man in action his interactions with smallbusiness owners from across the country range from the unpredictable to the outrageous as not everyone is comfortable taking advice that may conflict with how they currently run their companies unlike other semiscripted reality shows that shoot for a happy ending however the profit is honest about the outcomes—sometimes the deals work out and sometimes they don’t   in all cases however lemonis puts his threepart evaluation process to work a process he claims has played an important role in his own companys success he breaks down any business into these three key components people product and process heres how they affect the success or failure of a business according to lemonis people throughout all the first season episodes lemonis emphasized the importance of people for smallbusiness success but making sure you have the right people working for you is common knowledge to any entrepreneur thats why lemonis takes this basic advice a step further by showing business owners why it’s not just critical to have the right people—you have to have them in the right roles as well in the episode dealing with ecome a producer of green cleaning materials the companys founder had a trusted family member in a key sales position but this person wasnt really a good fit for the sales position—the company had the right person in the wrong job it’s also important to create an enabling environment for your employees to ensure they can perform at their best for your company la dogworks was a dysfunctional dogrelated services company the owner had caring thoughtful and dedicated employees who were constantly insulted berated and belittled by the boss having the right people in place isn’t going to lead to success if theyre in an environment where theyre made to feel like failures this episode reminded me of the mantra “the beatings will continue until morale improves product lemonis second key ingredient is a companys product in each episode he carefully examines whats being sold and its key marketing characteristics including pricing packaging sizing and targeting many times smallbusiness owners assume that consumers will view their product the same way they do but that isn’t always the case in the case of ecome the company decided to name their cleaning products after people they knew but most consumers won’t clean their floors with something called “ted”—its just too odd of a name and wasnt clicking with customers in the case of planet popcorn a specialty popcorn manufacturer and retailer modifying the packaging by creating a cleaner more streamlined look allowed the company to sell its popcorn at dramatically higher margins process the final element a company’s operations is key to ensuring a businesss efficiency and opportunities to scale the most memorable episode related to failed processes was planet popcorn the company makes and sells its specialty popcorn to corporate clients such as disney as well as through county fairs this mostly cash business had absolutely no procedures in place for managing its cash flow lemonis found piles of cash lying around everywhere the end result with no process in place the company couldn’t account for  in cash profits money which had basically disappeared if your company seems stuck and cant get to the level youd like take a look at the people product and processes in place at your business lemonis threestep evaluation process is logical effective and easy to implement i recommend it the profit still has openings available for companies that want to be considered for the second season not only will you get national publicity on cnbc you may also get an infusion of fresh capital and marcus lemonis as a notsosilent partner read more articles on leadership photo getty images marcus lemonis how to sell a niche product to a mass audience visit cnbccomx

product to a mass audience    wednesday  nov    am et   shares when adelo ramirez came to america at age five with little money or resources no one suspected that he would by  open a successful critically acclaimed restaurant los gemelos in port chester new york ramirez worked three jobs slept four hours a night and saved up  of his own money so that he could use his passion for cooking to start a business by  ramirez had new ambitions to manufacture tortillas for sale in local grocery stores not long after he decided he wanted to become the biggest tortilla manufacturer in the world unfortunately that dream fell short though ramirezs revenues approached half a million dollars shortly after he launched his tortilla line by  another large tortilla brand mission had come to the east coast and knocked us out big time says ramirez sales plummeted last year ramirezs revenue was just  adelo ramirez tortilla factory in operation since  was netting the business only  each day and wasnt complying with us safety codes but on the latest episode of the profit ramirez redoubles his efforts to transform his struggling tortilleria into a major food brand with the help of entrepreneur marcus lemonis to become a global brand lemonis instructs ramirez to make some changes first he has to close his shabby tortilla factory which hasnt been complying with us safety standards and is bleeding money then he has to start a new hispanic food company the market for hispanic foods is growing according to lemonis and worth  billion in the us alone rather than focus exclusively on tortillas lemonis encourages ramirez to pick three or four products that mexican and nonmexican communities would love we want these products to be authentic but we want to make sure they appeal to everyone all over the country lemonis says we want to focus on the meat of the market right in the core not on the fringes to determine the products in the market core ramirez and lemonis meet with food distributor tapia brothers a large west coast distribution house familiar with the hispanic market based on his knowledge of distribution erik tapia vice president of sales recommends a trio of approachable widely beloved products chips salsa and tortillas lemonis and ramirez also do market research they visit the popular grocery chain gelsons in los angeles to see what mexican products make the shelves they find chips salsa and tortillas but no mole pan dulce or tamales — so lemonis encourages ramirez to stay away from those while there may be little competition there there is also little very demand lemonis explains partnering with actor and comedian george lopez and using his face on all of ta locos branding helps separate the brand from its competitors though chips salsa and tortillas are all products with lots of marketplace competition ramirezs offerings could still stand out thanks to his partnership with comedian and actor george lopez lopez has become a champion of ramirezs restaurant and food business and agreed to lend recognition to the new brand in return for equity in the business and royalties ramirez lemonis and lopez decide to name their new brand ta loco an homage to one of george lopezs sayings a cartoon of george lopezs face will adorn the packaging the ta loco team will also create their products using fresh ingredients and homemade mexican recipes – their plan is to remain authentic while also appealing to the masses ramirezs homemade salsa had a richness and kick to it “but not so much kick that it would alienate people” marcus lemonis pointed out ramirez will not manufacture the foods himself instead hell partner with labased la fortaleza a manufacturer embedded in the hispanic foods market la fortaleza already makes its tortillas with real corn and can ensure ta loco tortillas will have an authentic traditional flavor while being able to deliver high capacity too by the end of the episode after employing lemonis

video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × why a selfmade millionaire puts his money on the line for struggling small businesses max nisen sep    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print youtube in  entrepreneur marcus lemonis started buying up rv dealerships with his company freedomroads three years later he merged it with parts and accessories dealer camping world now the combined company is a  billion business that controls  of the entire rv market  going into that business wasnt an accident lemonis deliberately chose an industry he thought he could dominate a decision sparked by what he calls the best piece of advice hes ever gotten many entrepreneurs can trace their careers back to a powerful lesson learned on the way or a wise mentor not all of them get the help of lee iaccoca the man who helped create the first mustang turned around a nearly bankrupt chrysler and remains one of the most legendary figures in american business the best advice i ever got was from lee iaccoca who was very influential in my career lemonis told business insider it was very simple it was get into a business where you can be a big fish not the little fish get into a business where you can be a change agent  where you can make a difference its worked well for me indeed lemonis has become a very big fish and hes taking that advice and everything hes learned over  years leading businesses and using it to help others in addition to his day job as ceo of camping world and its parent company good s lemonis is the host of cnbcs the profit a primetime reality show in which lemonis tries to save struggling businesses but rather than just giving advice he puts his own money and reputation on the line  i wanted people to know that this wasnt just a fresh coat of paint on the wall that these were real stakes lemonis says if you want to get somebody interested you put money on the table you dont go in there and tell them how smart you are or impress them by telling them what your credentials are you go in there and stand side by side and put your money up the experience has had a real impact on the businesses lemonis has invested in its taught him a lot as well what i know now is that running a small business is as hard as running a big business lemonis says it also reaffirmed my belief that people are the ones that make the difference my greatest takeaway is how important or unimportant people can be — how effective or how destructive they can be if theyre not the right people lemonis judges every business by what he calls the peopleprocessproduct principle great people an excellent and relevant product and the best possible process for creating delivering and selling that product  beyond people lemonis noticed one common mistake among business owners that he finds particularly irksome  people dont know their numbers he says referring to everything from inventory and price points to the companys balance sheet nothing infuriates me more  everything in business boils down to knowing how cash is flowing through the business lemonis says hes remained in touch with all of the participants in the show and he hears frequently how much knowing their numbers has positively impacted their businesses  lemonis was in his s when he first got into the rv business before starting freedomroads he worked his way up to managing  stores for autonation by the time he was  and he readily admits he made his share of errors when i was young i said things i shouldnt have i did things i shouldnt have lemonis says i dont know that i could have necessarily recharted that course the benefit is that i learned lessons and it helped me mature over time doing the show and putting his own money on the line is about more than making good investments or even good tv he says its about getting some of those lessons out there so people dont have to make the same mistakes he did   i really look at this in two ways one as a way for me to make a good return on my investment and second as an educational tool for everybody including myself lemonis says we want to pick businesses and concepts and topics that are real and raw and understandable whether its familyowned businesses integrity secondgeneration businesses or controls of cash theyre all themes that are essential  more small business business breakthrough strategy

an idiot  ken mccarthy  internet marketing and beyond navigation ken mccarthy  internet marketing and beyond is marcus lemonis an idiot by ken mccarthy in business advice let me cut straight to the chase and answer that question up front no but i’ll explain why some people might think so – and why they’re wrong but first this article assumes you know who marcus lemonis is and took my advice last month to watch his show on cnbc called “the profit” it’s on tuesday nights at  pm lemonis takes his own money and buys into struggling businesses he takes control of the business’ finances permanently and the operations long enough to get the business from intensive care and failing deep into the profit zone in the first three episodes he’s one for three in all three cases he massively improved the business but two out of three times his partners – to be blunt – screwed him so doesn’t that make him an idiot  after all isn’t it the sign of a business genius to never get screwed it might be – in fantasyland – but in the real world you’re going to find over and over again that character  and even basic sanity are in short supply you can do a lot of due diligence on people but at the end of the day the only reliable way to find out about someone is to get involved with them then you find out a lot – and fast here’s one lesson from the show i recommend you bank right now when people you’re doing things with start acting squirrely or don’t do what they say they’re going to do confront them right away – not in an antagonistic way but in a clear way you may be at fault for not being clear or the other person may be at fault for violating an agreement it doesn’t matter the point is to sort out expectations and draw a line in the sand quickly about what is and what is not acceptable you don’t need flakes in your life and the first time someone “flakes” is the first time to call them on it anything else it to invite and prolong misery perspective on cash cash is king and if you’ve got it it should be treated that way especially when a business is on its death legs does it make sense to put  or more into a business before you really know your partners yes…if you’ve got  billion in net worth as lemonis does  is   of  billion that’s the proportional equivalent of  to a person with  million does it make sense for you or me probably not in fact certainly not…but there’s a number that you can risk without risking your financial life and sanity know that number and do not exceed it futures traders say that never bet more than  of your position on any one idea that’s not a bad place to start thinking about the issue but keep in mind if you’re wrong ten times in a row – and it can happen – it’s going to hurt and hurt a lot is lemonis a gambler in one sense yes he’s gambling that the business owner is honest sane and competent in another sense no because he is absolutely not gambling that the numbers of the business can be fixed the deals he picks have massive upsides and limited and predictable downsides if he’s wrong on the people he loses a month of his time and  the time is worth far more to him that the money but if he’s right… the popcorn deal  let’s look at one deal the company manufactures and retails popcorn at amusement parks they were grossing around   million a year in sales the owner claimed to be losing money at least that’s what she told her mother who mortgaged her home to keep the business solvent lemonis’ deal was to put in  for a  share of profits and use his expertise to get the business to  million a year in sales rapidly and from there – who knows how high not a bad offer for a failing company at death’s door some forensic accounting revealed that instead of losing money the company was spinning off  in cash that turned out to be missing weird but not unheard of being conservative assume that  million in sales x the sales would only double that amount from  to  if so then lemonis’ onetime investment of  and some sweat equity on the front end and ongoing deal making and advice would yield him  a year every year let’s see  in once and  out every year… that’s a deal to jump at that’s a riskreward ratio that makes sense unfortunately the popcorn lady turned out to be a flake or worse and the front end investment of time and money went down a black hole but remember this was chump change to lemonis and the upside was well worth the risk realistic potentials like that don’t grow on trees what lemonis is doing very very right  real money is made by owning businesses not by stock speculating or real estate flipping or multilevel marketing or any other number of fantasy businesses yes there are people who can make things like this work but they are few and far between and they are a lot more circumstantial than most “successful” practitioners would like to believe also the financial graveyard is full of “successful” traders and real estate operators who leverage themselves to death business owning if you’ve got the stomach and guts for it is where it’s as a wealth building tool just ask warren buffet the world’s most successful “investor” is in reality they world’s most successful business collector let someone else run it – the money is in the deal making owning businesses can be massively profitable on the other hand operating businesses much less so for one thing being in charge of daily operations greatly limits your opportunities operations and deal making just don’t mix if you’re fixing the broken washing machine in your laundromat it’s kind of hard to be out looking for new laundromats to buy and even if you had the super human energy to deal with the endless daily operational issues of a business and be out beating the bushes for new opportunities you wouldn’t have much of a life – and even if you could  that level of energy expenditure is not sustainable by anyone in the long run no matter how energetic buy “way below wholesale” the highest price you’ll ever pay for anything is to go into a high end retail store and pay the full price on the sales ticket no one does that voluntarily – even millionaires – unless they’re in a mad rush to get something yet every year thousands of people with very limited means pay absolute top dollar for businesses and shares of businesses why they’re intimidated uninformed andor over eager of course the seller of the business thinks his business is worth a fortune – or wants you to think that too so you’ll pay one don’t do it smalls business are very hard to sell why the market is super thin  it’s not like a house where anyone of hundreds of families could happily own it you may well be the only potential buyer on earth that puts you not the seller in the driver seat get in it and stay in it your cash is king and their alternative might very well be zero keep that in mind at all times buy “losers” don’t buy the shiny profitable business the sellers usually aren’t going to give you any deals instead buy broken business that can be fixed – easily and cheaply the good news is that many can most small businesses are horribly mismanaged and neglected some in spite of that are sitting on very real gold mines sometimes all that’s needed are some very simple improvements to go from cash burning dog to a money machine just on the marketing side alone i’ve participated in overnight transformations of businesses and careers dozens of times it’s not rare product improvement personnel improvement new people andor better training and incentives and operations improvement are other areas where a dead business can often be brought back to life very quickly with a relatively small investment that’s the zone that lemonis is playing in that’s where you want to play too if you’re buying a business or buying into one  look at lots of deal this is an essential lesson of business and life too many people stumble onto something fall in love with it and then tie their future to it without doing any meaningful research or exploring lots of alternatives falling in love with a business is a disaster in the making if a business is not solidly in the black or has the potential to get there fast pass and go on to something else and do it today i cannot tell you the number of people i’ve seen waste years and years of precious time hoping that something that cannot and will not work is suddenly going to improve the only way to fall into this trap is to have a scarcity of opportunity – and the only way to have that is to be passive wait for deals to come to you and not be out there every day talking to people and looking at other potentials i think the average person has no idea how many “deals” you need to look at to find a good one of course you can be lucky but if you assume  out of  you’ll be in safe territory “the mine is bigger than the gem” people who find gems have systems for digging and sifting through lots and lots of dirt and they work very hard at their systems whatever they are “forever” businesses as a guy who has made his money on the bleeding edge of technology i envy the people who are in “forever” businesses in fact i’ve transitioned from tech to businesses like that and i’m running about  right now lemonis is in “forever” businesses that are also relatively simple to run ie you can hire people to do the work while you find more deals look at his first three deals – a company that buys and then resells used cars from consumers – a high end florist in a prime retail location in a prosperous us city – a company that sells popcorn in amusement parks tell me when are these businesses going to become “obsolete” when short of a direct asteroid strike are people going to a stop needing to sell their used cars fast without getting skinned by a traditional used car dealer b stop buying flowers for weddings funerals parties gifts and life in general and c stop going to fun places and buying snacks the only company that’s vulnerable to the ravages of time is the florist the city he’s in might go bad and its currently valuable location and market might be worth a whole lot less – but the company’s methods are portable and can be leveraged into dozens if not hundreds of outlets in more favorable locations long before that happens is the business you’re going into “forever” or is it a pet rock…or a vhs rental store finally the biggest lesson of all i don’t know lemonis so i can’t tell whether i like him or not how could i based on a television portrayal but here are two things i like about him a lot  he’s not afraid of work  he’s not afraid of getting bloodied two of the three deals didn’t work so what too many people a wildly underestimate how much time and energy it takes to make things happen and b put a small effort into one thing and then cry into their milk for the rest of their lives when it doesn’t work out just they way they hoped it would the world doesn’t work that way  like the rest of humanity you probably won’t “get lucky”  in the pursuit of a better life you’ll stub your toe get knocked down get rear ended at a stop light etc more than once you can turn these events into tragic events that define your life “the popcorn lady screwed me” or you can get on to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing until you find the things that do work the mine is bigger than the gem if you want a “gem” get out your shovel and pick and prepare to use you muscles in business your mind like you never used them before oh and learn to read a balance sheet lemonis clearly can – and so can
