in this presentation and discussion because of new information future events or otherwise and now here is dow dow r wilson good afternoon everyone our company began  with strong performance in oncology systems continuing growth momentum in imaging components and a  million gaap charge related almost exclusively to the california proton treatment center or cptc in san diego without which we would have handily beaten the high end of our earnings guidance range for the quarter to summarize our first quarter results we are reporting strong oncology global order growth of  together with a four point improvement in its gross margin rate imaging components gains in both orders and revenues companywide revenues of  million up  in both dollars and constant currency gaap net earnings of  per diluted share after reporting  per diluted share in charges related almost exclusively to cptc nongaap net earnings of  per diluted share after recording  per diluted share in charges related almost exclusively to an accounts receivable reserve for cptc and board approval of the spinoff of imaging components into a new public company varex imaging in the next few days focusing first on oncology systems orders totaled  million for the first quarter up  in both dollars and in constant currency broadbased demand for new equipment as well as software and services drove strong order growth across all geographies during the quarter first quarter orders in the americas grew by  in dollars and constant currency orders in north america grew by  growth in both dollars and constant currency the trailing  month order growth rate in north america is  first quarter oncology orders in apac rose by  in dollars and  in constant currency while emea grew orders by  in dollars and  in constant currency in india we booked  million for a multilinac project with a customer that will total  million over the next  years this is our first combined hardware and software as a service deal in the region and it demonstrates our ability to meet the growing need from customers for a cloud hosted software solutions elsewhere in emea we continue to perform strongly in poland as you will recall we acquired our distributor there last year during the quarter we won the majority of tenders and booked more than  million the highlight in our apac region was china where we achieved  order growth during the quarter with sizable gains in both equipment and services it appears that competitor protests to tender wins in this market are diminishing and are being resolved more rapidly we grew orders in japan where were seeing positive signs of a market recovery we supported an sbrt focused luncheon seminar at jastrow ph the japanese radiation oncology show where truebeam and hyperarc created a real buzz several hundred people attended our sessions on sbrt and truebeam emerging markets in asia were also active with good orders performance in south korea indonesia vietnam and the philippines turning to north america our order growth was driven mainly by healthy software and service gains as we expected potential changes to the affordable care act did not appear to impact market performance in the quarter touching on our service business global orders and revenues rose by about  in dollars in constant currency with gains in all territories on the software side we saw growing interest in our newly introduced  oncology software platform particularly from customers in western europe you may recall this offering which was introduced at the estro show in october is a first of a kind software tool that enables clinicians on tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialties involved in cancer treatment we have also continued to have a very positive market response to our rapidplan and insightive analytics software products that help improve the speed quality and cost efficiency of treatments we have now taken more than  orders to rapidplan since its launch and  systems are installed at customer sites around the world sales of our insightive product are also ramping up nicely during the quarter we received our th order for the vitalbeam treatment system half of these orders have come from customers in north america which demonstrates the appeal of this scalable solution even in developed markets comparing revenues on a trailing  month basis we believe we gained market share margins which elisha will discuss in a few moments also benefited from ongoing efforts to reduce product cost i will now turn to our particle therapy business which recorded first quarter revenues of  million as i mentioned at the outset of the call varian took a  million gaap charge in the first quarter in response to certain actions in january by cptc and its loan agent or its capital markets to address liquidity issues caused by lower than expected patient volumes that are insufficient to support cptc’s capital structure this led us to reserve  million in accounts receivable and to impair  million of our  million loans to cptc of which  million was accrued interest these charges and the associated limited tax deductibility reduced our earnings in the first quarter by  per diluted share on a gaap basis and by  per diluted share on a nongaap basis we are reporting additional information on this matter today in the form k filing with the securities and exchange commission we believe this center can get on a more solid financial footing by serving a broader patient population with additional health care providers both locally and regionally we remain confident and committed to supporting all of our customers and to building a profitable proton business based on leading technology that is treating many patients and performing at a high level of varians  proton projects we participated in the financing of only three as of today our outstanding proton loan balance totals  million for cptc and two other large regional centers in the us stepping back from the financing issues we are generating revenues and are continuing to make good progress on  installations our sales funnel continues to look promising now ill turn it over to sunny for his discussion of the imaging components business sunny sanyal thanks dow and good afternoon imaging components business had a very busy quarter as we prepared for the spinoff of varex imaging and announced the planned acquisition of the medical imaging business of perkinelmer first quarter revenues for imaging components were  million up  from the year ago period orders for our business were  million up  from a year ago period going forward as a standalone company varex will provide a different view than what youve seen in the past our public filings will provide a breakdown of revenues and gross margins by two segments medical and industrial each of these segments will include xray sources xray detectors connect and control components and software suited to their applications revenues for imaging components rose during the quarter with solid gains in both medical and industrial segments medical revenues increased by  with strong growth in ct tubes and dynamic detectors while industrial revenues grew by  were pleased to see good performance from global sales of dental detectors as well as sales growth for ct tubes in asia we continued to see price erosion in the lower priced radiographic portion of our detector business where we were able to maintain revenues with higher volumes connect and control revenues in both medical and industrial segments contributed good growth but our medical segment software product revenues were down for the quarter due to softness in veterinary imaging at the end of november we participated in the rsna trade show in chicago the largest event for radiology this show is always a great opportunity to see new imaging equipment products powered by our components being introduced at the show by our medical oem customers at this show we also introduced several new products and we enjoyed great customer response to our expanded offerings of collimators and next generation low dose low cost flat panel detectors in december we announced the signing of a purchase agreement to acquire the medical imaging business of perkinelmer were very excited to add this highly complementary business to our detector portfolio were getting a great team that has built a strong brand and product offering in the industrial imaging market in addition to their portfolio of medical imaging products they also bring us expertise in new detector technologies such as cmos which will enable us to broaden our offerings with higher resolution solutions for certain applications we expect to close this acquisition sometime in the summer after the regulatory approval process has been completed the spinoff of varex imaging is expected to be completed in a couple of days the when issued trading started on january th and the regular way trading is expected to start on january th the past few months have been filled with many meetings and road trip presentations with the investor and analyst community i invite you to go to our website vareximagingcom see more about our company and products it has been an exciting past year and as we prepare for the separation and i want to thank all the people at varian and varex who put in so much time and effort to make this a success in particular thanks to dow and elisha for all their support through this process now ill turn it over to elisha elisha w finney thanks sunny and hello everyone we have already covered orders and operations so let me start with backlog we ended the quarter at  billion up  from the year ago period including a  increase in the oncology backlog to  billion backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled  million bringing net orders for the company to  million now let me walk you through the pl first quarter revenues for the total company were  million up  in dollars and in constant currency oncology revenues declined  in dollars and  in constant currency versus a strong year ago quarter there was a geographic mix shift toward north american revenues which grew  in both dollars and constant currency to constitute  of oncology revenues in the quarter imaging components posted a first quarter revenue increase of  with increases in both its medical and industrial segment our particle therapy business posted revenues of  million up  from the year ago quarter driven by progress on installation the total company gross margin for the quarter was  up three points due to strong performance in oncology oncology systems gross margins increased by four points to  due to favorable product and geographic mix as well as product cost reductions imaging components gross margin for the quarter fell by almost two points to  as a consequence of a product mix shift toward radiographic detectors as well as stepped up investments and increased production capacities to meet expected longterm demand including the proton ar reserve first quarter sga expenses were  million up significantly in dollars and as a percentage of revenue from the year ago quarter the accounts receivable reserve up  million is considered in the ordinary course of business for accounting purposes and therefore is not adjusted out of earnings as a nongaap number excluding the ar reserve sga would have been  million or  of revenue first quarter rd expenses were  million or  of revenues equal to the year ago quarter as a percentage of revenue first quarter operating earnings totaled  million or  of revenue down significantly from the year ago period due to the proton ar reserve excluding this  million reserve the operating margin would have increased two points from the year ago quarter to  of revenue depreciation and amortization totaled  million for the quarter the gaap and nongaap effective tax rate was unusually high because of the proton impairment the cptc loan was made by our subsidiary in switzerland where our tax rate is low so there was very little tax benefit from the loan impairment furthermore a large portion of the ar reserve was attributable to our subsidiary in germany where our tax rate is effectively zero due to large tax loss carry forwards had it not been for the cptc impairment our tax rate would have been about  for the quarter for the balance of the year we believe varian’s tax rate from continuing operations will be in the range of  to  fully diluted shares outstanding decreased  million from the year ago quarter to  million shares due to our ongoing share repurchase program diluted gaap eps was  for the quarter nongaap eps for the quarter was  including a  impact from the proton ar reserve turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  million debt  million and stockholders equity of  billion dso of  days was up one day from the year ago period first quarter cash flow from operations rose by  from the year ago quarter to  million primary uses of cash were  million for capex and  million for the repurchase of half a million shares of stock as of today we have  million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization varian plans to repurchase  million shares in its second fiscal quarter of this year and now let me turn it back over to sunny and then dow for the fiscal  outlook for both varex imaging and varian sunny sanyal thanks elisha for varex imaging we expect revenues for fiscal  to grow by  to  over the  million total recorded for fiscal  in our form  filing with sec assuming approximately  million shares outstanding and a  tax rate we anticipate that gaap net earnings per diluted share for the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal  will be in the range of  to  going forward varex imaging will provide annual guidance now i’ll turn it over to dow for the varian outlook dow r wilson thank you beginning with our fiscal second quarter imaging components will be reflected as a discontinued operation for the first four months of fiscal year  the company is guiding for continuing operations for the second through the fourth quarters of the fiscal year  for the balance of the fiscal year we believe varian revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of  to  bringing revenue growth for the full year to  to  nongaap earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year will be in the range of  to  for the second quarter we believe varian revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of  to  and nongaap earnings per diluted share will be in the range of  to  to summarize the first quarter we have demonstrated strength in our oncology business with strong orders that will support future revenue growth we have successfully set up imaging components for continued expansion with an important acquisition in life as a new public company varex imaging and while it was painful our exposure to particle therapy financing has now been significantly reduced we are continuing our drive for profitability with over a dozen projects and a healthy sales funnel varian is poised now to focus exclusively on providing the world with the technology it needs to beat cancer and our product pipeline has never looked better were very much looking forward to the rest of fiscal year  were now ready for your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of anthony petrone with jeffries please proceed dow r wilson hi anthony anthony petrone hi dow how are you thanks and good afternoon everyone hi sunny hi elisha congratulations on approaching spin  to everyone good luck separate companies going forward i think dow im just getting some emails on sort of the implied full year guidance overall and maybe even more so the implied nongaap operating margin guidance for the remaining company as im working it here i think if we give back the  take into considerations the  in the quarter and adjust for share count differences i am coming up with about  to  in implied full company consolidated earnings so a just wanted to check if that math is correct and then b what would be the implied nongaap operating margin outlook for remain co and then a couple of follow ups for sunny elisha w finney yeah so anthony let me let me take a stab at it and please bear with this guys as we as we said because of the spin it is just  its going to be a little messy and so were going to try and clear this up to the best we can in q it really is apples and oranges because weve got both varian and varex weve got some duplicate costs and then of course weve got the complicating factor with the ar reserve that we could not adjust out for nongaap purposes so we decided lets each guide q through q as standalone companies as continuing operations what i can say though anthony and this is a very very rough back of the envelope rule of thumb is when i have looked at what continuing operations is for fiscal year   and  and some of the quarters and these are unaudited so they have not been published anywhere yet they will be the continuing operations is anywhere from  to  of our reported numbers so if you were to consider i dont know which number you want to use but assuming you start with the  that excludes the ar you can take  of that it gets you to  and you could then add that to varians guidance which at  on the midpoint would put you at  for the fiscal year was that as clear as mud anthony petrone that does help and i think we can run an implied operating margin guidance but i guess some confusion around that would be elisha w finney of course sorry i forgot that part of your question for these  for q through q it should be in the range of  to  and then as i mentioned for q without the ar reserve we would have been at  but of course that includes some varex imaging numbers in there anthony petrone okay and then the followup for sunny would be the  growth number in the first quarter was ahead of what we were expecting and so i guess the question there is are there new contracts that were won in there or was there normalization of toshiba and then the follow up question would be on the varex implied guidance what does the operating margin profile look like through the remainder of the year thank you sunny sanyal yeah anthony first of all we have had really good growth for the last three to four quarters and its a very good sign and we have confidence in the recovery path that were on for this quarter we had some easy comps so the first half as you recall our first half of  was soft so for the second half weve got some tough comps and so the  to  is what we were anticipating for fiscal year  clarence verhoef you know second question on operating margins im sorry so i will take that anthony this is clarence the operating margins for the balance of the year the q through q will be in the range of  to  there is a little bit of incremental sga cost associated with being a standalone company and then i guess as elisha kind of alluded to there is just a ton of complication in trying to understand exactly what the q number is so therefore were just really trying to give a cleaner answer is to just talk about the qs and q along those lines a little bit maybe one additional bit of information where youll get more visibility to this as we will file a q for q at the end of february and its going to have a lot more breakdown of that and well be able to give you a little more color on the one time separation costs that are included in there anthony petrone thanks i’ll hop back in queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brandon henry with rbc capital markets please proceed brandon henry yes thanks for taking my question the first on the oncology systems gross margin looks like they continue to make good progress in the quarter i think you mentioned last quarter that the gross margins for oncology systems would kind of be in the  to  range i think you were above that range this quarter so does that guidance now appear conservative and then maybe you can just talk about your expectations for gross margins for the remainder of the year for oncology systems dow r wilson you know on the quarter we had good product mix good geographic mix and then something weve been talking about last four to five quarters weve had very good cost performance and variable cost performance on the product cost and installation warranty elisha can walk us through some of the guidance impact but those are the big drivers on the quarter elisha w finney yeah so at this point brandon i am preferring to stick to the  to  i feel quite confident in those numbers given the performance that oncology has had the last several quarters they really started to improve gross margin in the second half of last year so the comps get a little more difficult but clearly i mean the business has done an outstanding job of maintaining stable pricing product cost reduction higher software that would be the upside if the stock were mixed we are to increase then clearly that could be some upward bias on the margin but were sticking to  to  brandon henry okay and then separately i think you mentioned that you were seeing some positive signs of a market recovery in japan and i think thats kind of the first time ive heard that in a while so can you give us some more details on that commentary and is the government again kind of picking up spending like what we saw in the past or is that something else dow r wilson well we unfortunately have not seen any new incremental government stimulus spending thats what really drove this market three to four years ago so we havent seen that but we have seen kind of a stabilization of the market with a little bit of growth so and thats two quarters in a row now so we connected the dots i mean i think its still early but our funnel looks pretty good and that market has come down pretty substantially from where it was two to three years ago but were starting to see some turnaround our shares have been good there too brandon henry okay and then just last question on china i think you said there was  order growth in the quarter for china how much of that was attributable to a resolution of the previous protests and then can you just talk about your expectations for china for the remainder of the year thanks dow r wilson you know the protests piece was anniversary and so in fact what youre really looking at is growth so we feel good about that the market is strong and funnel remains good the team is executing very well id say that we continue to do very well especially at the high end of that market and get orders  good orders there so good execution in a good market brandon henry okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff johnson with robert w baird please proceed dow r wilson hi jeff jeff johnson hi guys how are you good alright so let me ask two hopefully quick questions and then i think im more confused after we went through the questions with anthony but i want go through few numbers here if i could but first dow just on the proton business you write down some of the scripts business you gave a number that you still have  million exposure out there what is the risk to that exposure number one and number two what your appetite may be for financing additional field down issue here dow r wilson great questions so the total exposure as i said is  million weve got  million remaining to cptc in san diego weve got  million outstanding sub debt to maryland and weve got  million of sub debt to new york so those are the three that we have outstanding id say feel very good about new york and maryland and where they are large centers maryland is coming up to speed very very quickly fastest ramp we believe in proton therapy theyre now doing  to  patients theyve got one more beamline coming on next month which should reduce the patient volume again a little bit more in terms of appetite for more of these these are all very large centers id say that we dont have much appetite for large centers but we still look to use the balance sheet where there is a lower breakeven point a smaller center where were a partner with reputable financing partners where were not the largest lender and where were working with clinical partners who are leaders in their markets so for example in the case of both new york and baltimore we are working with local leaders in their markets and that makes a big difference and then of course we want i think the deal structure on this one was a little bit unique we did it in  so our first probing show site and in any case i think we want to make sure that weve got a local partner with some skin in the game elisha you have anything to add there elisha w finney no i would just say we are encouraged that big banks are continuing to finance proton centers varian has sold off as indicated a  million of loans that we had initially put on these centers we sold off new york and a portion of san diego and the muni ph financing program in georgia from what we hear is continuing to proceed well so i do think this is somewhat of a unique situation as dow mentioned jeff johnson okay and then elisha maybe not a technical accounting explanation because i really dont want to hear that but out of the  million write off you guys excluded  million but theres another  million that we essentially have to take out of your sga and to nongaap earnings and things like that to get it applestoapples elisha w finney that is correct jeff and its because and i wont give you any technical accounting but its because from a sec guidance standpoint accounts receivable is deemed in the ordinary course of business its not deemed unusual and something you can adjust into a nongaap number jeff johnson okay and so the question where i want to step through a couple things is just if i look at your disclosures you get  million in nongaap net earnings i need to add back about  million to that so your nongaap net earnings x all of the noise of the write off would have been closer to  million to  million or so is that correct elisha w finney ive got it on eps jeff because the tax rate change between the gaap and the nongaap as well because again a lot of the ar was attributable to germany at a  rate the loan is at swiss rate so the nongaap tax rate is  i think it was where as gaap is  suffice it to say let me do it  let me give it to you this way lets just assume you start with  lets assume you start with  you add the two numbers together  is the ar reserve  is the loan impairment and then youve got  of other stuff like the spend and litigation and amortization of intangibles and those sorts of things and thats how you get to the  gaap jeff johnson alright thats fine x all that noise and we could use your  number for the quarter that equates to a little over  million in net earnings x that so if we start there is a base i dont want to dominate the time here but if we start there is a base youre guiding over the next three quarters i think between the two businesses the net earnings and if we take the eps out of it just because again the share count changes with varex and that youre guiding to about  million in net earnings between the two companies if i add that to the  million or so youre essentially guiding combined companies all noise out of it at somewhere around  million i think is that about reasonable because the street was at  i think you guys are guiding somewhere around  and there are some big numbers floating around here in emails and all that that you guys are cutting    out of what where street has been thinking and im just not getting it that big elisha w finney well let me take a stab at this jeff i will answer for varian and ill let clarence answer for varex q through q when you run through our guidance you are going to see we are somewhere between call it  million and  million of net income for varian then you need to take about  of q net income assuming that’s what continuing operations will be for varian and add it to that number and then on top of that you would need to add the varex net income for q through q clarence verhoef and that number just using the  to  range and i remember shares outstanding is somewhere in the range of  million to  million of net income after tax one of the challenges there by the way also jeff is that the varex tax rate is significantly different than the varian tax rate our tax rates in the range of  jeff johnson yes understood and then just on top of that clarence just add the  or whatever it would be from the q  million or so clarence verhoef that’s a fair approximation at this point in time from us lets call it a nongaap perspective because that would exclude pro forma and look back time separation costs and the like jeff johnson alright oh i think my numbers are right but ill follow up with you guys after offline just to make sure but i appreciate the time thanks guys dow r wilson sure operator thank you our next question comes from line of tycho peterson with jp morgan please proceed tycho peterson hey thanks question on the viability of the particle therapy market you know i know jeff asked your earlier about your willingness to finance but indiana did shut down san diego is having a liquidity issues can you maybe just talk about you know the health of some of the other projects underway and why you think theres still a viable market here dow r wilson yeah i mean i think when we look into the funnel we still have a good funnel indiana was a very specific case with some extremely old technology thats been a little blown out of proportion but that center was  to  years installed and installed as frankly as kind of a research center with a little bit of clinical lad on so i think its failure has been a little overstated in the marketplace there were some procure issues in the market a couple years ago now san diego i think the transition from these really really large centers to small center something weve been talking about on our call is very much going on in the marketplace i mean this center would be very viable as a two or three room center financially and so its got a tough capital structure it maybe a little bit over built for the market in the market position we do think that as it regionalizes and has opportunity to bring some more customers in especially in the san diego area that it can be viable so i think there are some very specific things about san diego that made it that way were still of our  customers  are cash paying so weve got the three that i talked about and we feel very good about where two of those are and clearly nobody is proud about this but we feel pretty good about where things are headed tycho peterson and then maybe can you just touch on what youre hearing from your customers in the us on the capex front i mean your orders held up okay in north america and as you highlighted a lot of that was software and service but im just thinking about the remainder of the year did you see a freeze on capex budgets dow r wilson you know everybody is watching what happens in washington but id say at this point in time were not seeing a change in our funnel shape or size and as i said in the call our  in the script our rolling  month performance in north america is  i would say thats pretty good for  months and from a funnel point of view were not seeing that change clearly who knows whats going to happen in washington and everybody is watching but its not changing behavior in the shortterm tycho peterson okay and then just two modeling ones for dyssynergies can you tell us what the  guidance i know you talked about  million over two years should we just assume  million this year elisha w finney we will exit this year with  million of dyssynergies out it has a roughly a  basis point impact on the ebit margin this year that we also our tax rate is going to go down because as clarence mentioned varex is at a higher tax rate so we are helped at the after tax line tycho peterson okay and then for sunny the varex guidance doesnt include anything for synergies right assuming obviously that deal hasn’t closed yet sunny sanyal no it is standalone varex tycho peterson okay perfect thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of vijay kamar with evercore isi please proceed vijay kumar hey dow how is it going thanks for taking my question i just maybe go back to the guidance question right if you just go back simplistically maybe elisha theres a question for you on the last call so we thought that the combined rate was with the preoncology piece eps would do high singles so if we did  of eps last year that implies somewhere around  call it  around that ballpark and i think the new guidance is  at the midpoint i guess part of the delta that  delta is the dyssynergies right which is maybe  but it still feels like theres a  delta between how we were thinking about numbers three months ago versus now i just want to make sure was there anything else from an accounting perspective that im missing the way im thinking about numbers thank you elisha w finney im not sure vijay let me let me walk through it one more time in terms of our if you take the midpoint of our q through q so lets call it  and then you add the  for q now theres about four months there where we have some duplicate costs that were absorbing it is probably i dont know  pennies or so that were absorbing while varex has been out hiring duplicate positions that would compare to the  from last year and dont hold me to this it is unaudited but the continuing operations number for varian is  and for varex is about  so that  call it  compares to the  if you just look at it that way vijay kumar i guess we will take this off line because im not sure i get the math completely to be honest elisha i guess maybe one on  in a doubt on the proton business a lot of questions here on  for the other parts of the businesses right other contracts you have you mentioned  projects right dow r wilson yes vijay kumar i guess the reason for the financing issue was volumes can you just talk about why for the other projects volumes wouldnt be an issue is this a reimbursement issue or im just trying to understand was this more regional issue for them in california dow r wilson id say this is very much an issue in san diego so first of all about  orders i have top  count off top of my head but at least  of them are outside of the us so there tends to be its not true in every case but it tends to be sovereign government purchases so those are in pretty good shape you know one or two of them are not one or two of them are private but the vast majority of them are sovereign government purchases backstop that way so should be very good from a credit point of view in the us i mean new york the lead customer there is the top cancer center in new york city theyre already sending very significant numbers of patients to other centers so as they build their own center theyll pull that volume back to this center so we feel very good about the viability of new york baltimore is ramping very nicely little bit of a slow start but theyve gotten to  to  patients and now they open in february last year so just in a year theyve ramped up very nicely good reimbursement environment there and i think this is really kind of about some of the very specific contractual things and market conditions that were in san diego vijay kumar got you and maybe up one for sunny a lot of questions sunny on the outlook for varex i guess maybe simplistically if i look back margins for your business was in the mid s were now looking at high teens is there if i just had to look at it from a medium term perspective is there any reason why peak margin shouldnt go back up to  or are there any reasons why the new i guess normalized margins would be below sort of a historical peak sunny sanyal so weve communicated previously that we see as we have we expect margins to climb back up to  from where we are today in the ish range and thats how far as we see at this point we dont see a way to get back to the ish range those were at a point in time when low end of the radiographic flat panels range the pricing impact was less but also overtime weve added more rd and big rd investment so with that as our base costs we see us getting to ish vijay kumar and maybe just one last and i know im taking time here on i guess if you look at the guidance for varex and q obviously is off to a strong start any reason why you have had numbers improving over the last couple of quarters why rest of the year should be  for the business sunny sanyal so as i said earlier significant part of the reason is the comps first half of  versus first half of  we had a tough first half in  so came off a relatively easier comps we had a very strong second half in  so we got pretty strong comps going into the second half so thats why were expecting at this point to net out at  to  for fiscal year  vijay kumar got you that was helpful guys thank you elisha w finney and vijay just before you go i just want to remind you guys unfortunately this guidance is complicated because the continuing operations accounting is not yet done when it is we will be posting this historical numbers on our website and will come out  were going to post fy  the annual fy   and  next week or soon thereafter and then were going to give you quarterly continuing operations at the pretax level next week as well so youll have a lot more information on looking at varian and varex as independent companies vijay kumar that would be helpful elisha because a lot of questions im getting as looks like  the guidance was cut im not sure im sure you know theres a lot of accounting math here and well take it offline but those disclosure think would be helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of amit hazan with citi please proceed q  amit hazan hey good afternoon guys let me surprise you and stick with the guidance topic maybe i’ll approach it in a little bit of a different way that im less interested in the mechanism around that than i am around how to model remaining varian in a little bit longer term so if you think about it kind of as fiscal year  or down to  maybe better fiscal  give us a sense of what the operating margin aspiration is going to be for you but is it kind of  to  in fiscal  what is it going to be in fiscal  and maybe thatll help us to try to understand what kind of earnings growth the model off of what many of us i think are going to come off and i think many of us are going to be around  for fiscal  so how do we grow above that elisha w finney yes so i mean we did the longterm kind of expectations at the top line will be in the mid single digits were not coming off of that so that remains to be true from a pretax margin its a little harder post then to get to that  im going to make a lot of this up in the tax rate so if we can go from  to  up to  in the next two to three years that is what were going to be aiming for so its  to  as our expectation for this  for the balance of this fiscal year and then i would hope to get at least  to  basis points as we go forward into the fiscal year  as well q  amit hazan okay so let me turn to sales i dont think this has been covered yet on the sales volume especially while you guys actually reiterated your  to  guidance net reported number despite the fact that currency has gone against you so the fx effect on guidance really is what the fx number that you are guiding to is actually youre putting forward a kind of an increase of your fx guidance essentially so i want to make sure that thats confirmed with you and then secondly in the proton piece and you talked about that being up in fiscal  do you still feel comfortable that thats going to be up this year elisha w finney so in terms of fx if i look at where both the euro and the yen are today versus the year ago period it is roughly neutral theres a little bit of a help with the yen and a little bit of hurt with the euro and those tend to net out so the fx impact on q was very little im expecting if rate stay stable where they are today and the balance of the year then fx was going to be pretty neutral to the balance of the year protons we are expecting growth i am being very cautious just obviously in light of what the impairment that weve announced we will be recording service revenue on the cptc proton center on a cash basis because once i impair a receivable and a loan then it doesnt make any sense that i can then start to accrue revenue for that so im a little less  a little less optimistic on protons today just because of the situation we are in but i would say thats offset by a little more optimism in our oncology business which is just doing very well q  amit hazan let me just follow up on that just as the last question so the currency has moved a lot since you gave guidance about three months ago so the dollar is strengthened a lot against the euro and against the yen and so maybe i dont if i understand why it would be the same now than it was three months ago for you and given the proton piece if youre a little bit more cautious on that youre still kind of  you still feel good though that we should be within that range of  to  that you gave three months ago dow r wilson i mean it is not even clear how weve built the guidance on the revenue side is when you look at our last two or three quarters in oncology theyve all been very good so we have certainly had the orders i mean just in this quarter alone the oncology backlog was up  or  so weve got a very good backlog there and the margin position in the backlog as weve talked about looks very good q  amit hazan but you know  yeah go ahead elisha w finney sorry the euro has barely moved from when we gave guidance last i mean in q our average rate was  as of today it is  i would  thats is the level a little bit of help on the yen a little bit  so but they tend to be roughly an offset the impact was very small in q and we expect that for the balance of the year q  amit hazan okay just one final clean up question on the share purchase you said you would buy  million shares is that incremental to what you usually buy or is that just  you are just going to because that is pretty close to what you guys usually do in the quarter how should we model that elisha w finney well now thats a little higher than what we have typically been doing when we were one varian it was  million to  million shares per quarter typically obviously with varian standalone theres going to be cash flow from operations will be lower by about  we are just front loading so we did  in q and the plan is under b that we will do  million in q q  amit hazan okay thanks very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of anthony petrone with jefferies please proceed anthony petrone great for fitting me into the followup just a couple of followups for sunny and then maybe one for elisha im just trying to get to a full year earnings number and so we have  to  for the remaining four quarters and i know clarence you mentioned you have to sort of tax it under a different tax scheme using  so my implied range for varex for the year is  to  im not sure if that makes sense if im in the ballpark so any feedback there would be helpful and then just on the consolidated guidance im just wondering what is in there for stock based compensation i guess more so for remain co thanks again sunny sanyal well let me let me start out by first of all saying that it’s for q to q its  to  and i have because of the carve out costs or the spin off costs in q its going to be lower than the average of those three quarters okay so i would just say that q is going to be at a lower rate im not ready to talk through the specifics of it yet because we havent finished determining what those are thats part of this discontinued ops discussion that we also were talking about previously so give us a little bit of patience here to get to that number and so i cant  i probably cant give you exactly the answer youre looking for for the full year anthony petrone that’s helpful sunny sanyal then the question about the stock based comp i guess its fundamentally at the same level of those as historical and so i guess the question is a little bit about are you asking what the mix is between varex and varian is that the question anthony petrone maybe just some more simply what is the level of stock based compensation reflected in the guidance for both remain co and varex elisha w finney i dont want to get down to that level of detail i would tell you in q for total company it was  million was what was included we’re just not going to post the guidance in that detail anthony petrone thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of indiscernible with crm please proceed unidentified analyst hey guys on the varex side for some sort of housekeeping can you give us a sense or an update of what cash or debt the balance sheet will look like at separation for varex clarence verhoef yeah so a level of cash is going to be around  million to  million with a good portion of that being offshore and then the level of debt will be around  a little bit north of  million unidentified analyst okay great and then you gave us a slide deck for varex when you were doing the road show that had  million of revenue in the first quarter of  and so if you do the comparison yearoveryear its not  its more like  or  is there just some sort of difference there clarence verhoef yeah its a little bit of an apples and oranges that  includes the intercompany sales to oncology so you would actually take the varian imaging components number of  and add  million to it if you are going to look at varex as a standalone entity and then youre back to  again unidentified analyst i see and then just to clarify what youre saying clarence about eps the gaap guidance youre giving us includes stock comp and dna so it is just a pure gaap number clarence verhoef thats exactly right unidentified analyst okay and then on the close of the pki deal i seem to recall you guys originally saying sort of april may maybe now youre saying summer has there been a change there clarence verhoef no april is the earliest that it can be done weve put built out into the actual purchase agreement that april is the earliest but its just that the assumption is that the hart scott rodino review process could take longer if it goes through a second review cycle and the like and so its totally a speculation at this point time i from a planning perspective were planning it out as if it’s the first of april but the timing could be delayed just because of that process unidentified analyst okay and then in terms of orders at varex can you sort of talk about your largest customer order patterns there up yearoveryear or they just sort of in line stable and any comments on china versus japan i guess sunny alluded to that in his comments sunny sanyal yes so i’ll take it as two separate questions in general we see strength in our ct tubes business in china and that continues to be a good solid trend for us weve made a lot of investments in that area and its a core part of our growth strategy orders performance has been consistent with how this business has performed so theres nothing unusual there their performance with our largest customer toshiba continues to be  its come back towards normal and the relationship and everything we do with them is solid foundations are very strong there unidentified analyst as you alluded to sunny a little bit of volumes versus price with the volumes being strong and price somewhat we see you still seeing the impact of the renegotiations due to fx in late  maybe a little more color around some of the pricing sunny sanyal so first of all the price pressures are predominantly in the low end of the detector space which is a radiographic detectors which is also our smaller part of our detectors business in there the price  those price adjustments that happen that were at one point triggered by the fx situation but in general pricing in that segment even after it was a onetime correction but we saw a pretty significant prior significant price adjustment but now the price erosion is down to what i would call as historical levels there in the mid singledigits range and thats what we saw in this quarter but we had good volume which offset that unidentified analyst great thanks for the color and good luck sunny sanyal thank you operator thank you we have no further questions in queue at this time id like to hand the floor back over to management for closing remarks dow r wilson thank you and thank you all for participating a replay of this

continue being a varian investor like all of you for many more years thanks again for your support and now heres dow dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc good afternoon im pleased to report that our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year  were at the high end of our earnings per share expectations highlights included solid growth in orders and revenues in our oncology systems business a new system order in our particle therapy business improved gross margins in our oncology business and steppedup investment in sga for market developments and new product introductions additionally we successfully completed the spinoff of the imaging components business as varex imaging which is off to a great start to summarize varians second quarter results we are reporting gaap earnings from continuing operations of  per diluted share and nongaap earnings from continuing operations of   per diluted share companywide revenues of  million up  solid oncology orders of  million up  in dollars and  constant currency bringing yeartodate orders growth to  in dollars and constant currency and a  million equipment order for a singleroom proton system in delray florida focusing first on oncology operations we had a good quarter with solid order growth in emerging markets as well as healthy orders for software in north america and equipment in emea looking specifically at order growth rate in each region oncology grew gross orders in the americas by  in dollars and constant currency orders in north america were up by  bringing the yeartodate order growth in this region to  looking at some highlights in the americas we took orders to replace  accelerators from competitors we also took numerous software orders for replacement of competitive software for treatment planning and information management among the competitive conversions was a  million year software commitment from orlando health they will install our full suite of software including eclipse aria and velocity systems and our fullscale managed services package we booked nearly  million of that order in the second quarter and well book the rest as installations are scheduled elsewhere in north america we booked  truebeam orders for installation at chul  in québec city and then another  truebeam orders for a rhode island hospital in providence in latin america orders grew by nearly  versus a relatively small yearago number with order activity driven primarily by brazil where construction of our new complexo for education and manufacturing is nearing completion while the sales funnel across latin america looks promising activity is slow and we continue to be cautious about the rate of recovery in this market turning to emea orders rose  in dollars and  in constant currency africa the middle east and western europe were the biggest growth drivers in this region business in africa has more than doubled over the past year and has risen successfully successively for the last four quarters as you may have seen from our recent press release we are now selling direct in south africa among the highlights in africa were orders for the first edge radiosurgery system in morocco to serve the north africa subregion and a low energy linear accelerator in the democratic republic of congo which is the first modern linear accelerator in a country of more than  million people we also generated notable orders in tunisia as well as in turkey and israel spain and portugal contributed strongly to emeas western european growth during the quarter placing orders for a total of eight accelerators including  truebeams  vitalbeams and two clinacs in apac gross orders rose  in dollars and  in constant currency service grew in doubledigits but product sales also played a key role in this region orders in china rose by  and we believe we have the leading share in this market particularly in the highend segment with products like trilogy vitalbeam truebeam and edge we are on track to top  million orders in china this year we also saw good order performance in korea and the philippines we also received our first order in cambodia for an accelerator and brachytherapy unit for cambodias largest public hospital calmette during the quarter we hosted three users meetings in apac including beijing bangkok and melbourne we welcomed more than  customers at these terrific events where presentations focused on radiotherapy innovations  radiosurgery and the role of immunotherapy turning to our global service business we grew orders by  in the quarter and  for the first half this more than  billion annual business is continuing to grow faster than oncologys overall growth rate and contributing to margin expansion on the hardware front truebeam continued its momentum with more than  installations worldwide or about  of our global installed base truebeam is a widely accepted product that addresses a clinical need in every region of the world it is a versatile platform capable of delivering every type of treatment from radiotherapy to radiosurgery with either electrons or photons and at multiple energy levels we are continuing to add to truebeams capability and later this year we expect to introduce the first version of our hyperarc module for high definition head and neck radiosurgery with ultraprecise doses that cannot be matched by any other system on the market were also making good progress with software as of the end of the quarter we had about  licenses ordered from more than  sites for our rapidplan product that significantly enhances the quality and speed of treatment planning the rampup of this product has been tremendous we see more opportunity ahead as less than  of the treatment planning installed base has adopted this technology since its introduction  months ago our insightive analytics software for identifying and removing bottlenecks in the clinical workflow has been ordered at more than  customer sites who will use it to improve their clinical effectiveness and operational efficiency we are building a robust pipeline of prospects for our  oncology product i will now turn to our particle therapy business which generated  million in revenues during the quarter and recorded  million in orders including the delray project this project is being financed in part by the sale of  million in bonds including  million of subordinated bonds purchased by varian several other centers in the us are working on similar bond financing in addition to the delray order varians probeam compact single room system has been selected as the equipment of choice for a center in thailand and we hope to book that order in the third quarter when the requisite paperwork is processed our proton sales funnel looks promising with another two to four projects that have the potential to be booked this year before turning it over to elisha i want to take a few moments to call your attention to some recent promising studies on the role of radiotherapy for prostate and bone cancer as well as some lung cancer studies the new england journal of medicine has published two recent positive studies for radiotherapy the first shows that untreated prostate patients had more disease progression and metastatic disease compared to treated patients the study in the uk involved  patients who were randomized to either watchful waiting radical prostatectomy or d conformal radiotherapy over a year period the second study found no clinically significant difference in disease control between patients treated with either radiation or surgery however patientreported quality of life outcome showed that surgery had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary continence in contrast radiotherapy had little effect on urinary continence bowel toxicity was slightly worse with radiotherapy but that largely cleared up after six months except for a minor increase in more frequent rectal bleeding today most radiotherapy for prostate cancer uses imageguided imrt a more precise method of dose delivery also astro recently just published guidelines for palliation of bone mets with radiation which continues to be the gold standard for palliative care while  of hospice professionals believe radiotherapy should be used for pain control only  of hospice patients actually receive it a study in canada showed similar results combined these studies suggest that not only is radiation for bone mets effective it is also underutilized finally two papers were presented recently at a thoracic cancer meeting in san francisco the first was a multiinstitutional study that analyzed patients over yearsold with early stage nonsmall cell lung cancer treated with radiosurgery despite their age these patients tolerated radiation quite well with a year local control of  and a cancerspecific survival of  dispelling the myth that elderly patients cannot have curative radiation second preliminary results were reported in an abstract looking at  lung cancer patients retreated with proton therapy at md anderson these patients typically do poorly but in this study  of patients had their tumors controlled at one year and had an impressive median survival of  months though retrospective this small study does suggest that proton therapy may be an important tool for recurrent previously radiated tumors now ill turn it over to elisha elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc thanks dow and hello everyone we have already covered orders and operations so let me start with backlog we ended the quarter at  billion up  from the yearago period including a  increase in the oncology backlog to  billion backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled  million bringing net orders for the company to  million now let me walk you through the pl second quarter total company revenues from continuing operations were  million up  in dollars and up  in constant currency oncology revenues totaled  million up  in dollars and in constant currency versus the yearago quarter international revenues rose  and constituted  of oncology revenues in the quarter yeartodate oncology revenues were up  in dollars and in constant currency our particle therapy business posted revenues of  million up  from the yearago quarter driven by ongoing progress on installations yeartodate particle therapy revenues were up  the total company gross margin for the quarter was  up  basis points with a point gain in oncology largely offset by declines in the proton business oncology systems gross margin increased by a point to  due to a favorable product mix as well as product cost reductions for the first half oncology gross margin is up almost  points to  proton therapy gross margin was a negative  due largely to revised profitability estimates on two projects in the uk where the pound is at a historical low for the first half proton gross margin is down from the yearago period to  for the first half total company gross margin was up more than  points to   second quarter sga expenses were  million or  of revenues in line with our expectations as we accelerated investments in the introduction and commercialization of new products second quarter rd expenses were  million or  of revenues equal to the yearago quarter as a percentage of revenue second quarter operating earnings totaled  million or  of revenue down from the yearago quarter due to lower proton gross margin and the increased investment in sga depreciation and amortization totaled  million for the quarter the effective tax rate was  for the quarter lower than expected due to a large revenue shift to emea where rates are relatively low for the balance of the year we believe varians tax rate will be about  to  during the quarter we spent  million to repurchase  million shares of stock fully diluted shares outstanding decreased  million from the yearago quarter to  million due to our ongoing share repurchase program diluted gaap eps from continuing operations was  for the quarter nongaap eps from continuing operations for the quarter was  yeartodate nongaap eps from continuing operations was  including the  impact from proton accounts receivable impairments in q versus  for the same period last year turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  million debt of  million and stockholders equity of  billion dso at  days was down nine days from the yearago period due exclusively to significant improvements in our oncology business which is at  days cash flow from operations including discontinued operations was  million for the second quarter and  million for the first half primary uses of cash were  million toward the repurchase of  million shares of stock and  million for capex as of today we have  million shares remaining under our existing repurchase authorization this is my last call as well and i will be retiring as cfo on may  for me it has been a tremendous pleasure to work with you and i thank you for the support that you have shown me and this great company like spencer i will be a longterm varian shareholder and my blood will always run varian blue and now let me turn it back to dow dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc thanks elisha we now believe that for the second through fourth quarters of fiscal  total company revenues from continuing operations will grow in the range of  to  depending on the timing of proton orders for the full fiscal year total company revenues from continuing operations should grow in the range of  to  for the second through fourth quarters we expect that earnings per diluted share from continuing operations will be in the range of  to  for the full fiscal year earnings per share from continuing operations should be in the range of  to  including the  impairment of proton account receivables in the first quarter for the third fiscal quarter we believe varian revenues from continuing operations will grow by about  and we expect that nongaap earnings per diluted share will be in the range of  to  to summarize the second quarter we had solid orders and revenue growth in oncology systems a new singleroom proton order a gain in our gross margin and earnings at the high end of our target range we have stepped up our investment in market development as well as new product introductions that will drive continued growth around the globe i want to remind you to attend our investor meeting next week at the new york stock exchange or via webcast you can get details on our investor relations website were excited about the future and were looking forward to the rest of fiscal year  before turning it over to your questions id like to acknowledge elisha and spencer for their many contributions to the company plus quarters together whats the exact count elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc  dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc  quarters together thats more than imaginable and we are so grateful for their contributions for the advocacy theyve had for our customers for our shareholders for our employees and for the communities that we live and operate in theyve been great business partners and on behalf of myself and the company we wish to thank them well miss their leadership and well miss the blond hair flip and the voluble banter so with that well open up for questions thank you spencer and elisha spencer r sias  varian medical systems inc hey thank you very much dow i just want to thank you for those comments but i also want to just interject a quick correction we talked about the investor meeting next week at the new york stock exchange it is on may th which is the week after next and so the details are there and not your fault its just my final error i hope dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc may th and well now open for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session our first question comes from the line of jeff johnson of robert w baird please proceed with your question jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc yes thank you good morning guys elisha and spencer congratulations on the retirements and best of luck to you and elisha how you survived  quarters with that man i dont know elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc thank you jeff jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc and spencer that was supposed to be a backhanded compliment to you as well so congratulations spencer r sias  varian medical systems inc yes i got that i got that jeff thank you jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc so a couple of questions dow first just on guidance you came in at revenue wise above kind of the threequarter guidance that youve been providing you came up above that from a revenue perspective this quarter but you are lowering the low end of that threequarter revenue guidance so just trying to figure out the dynamics of a third a second quarter that was kind of above expected but now guidance is being trimmed at the bottom end and whats driving that and then a second guidance question just it looks like tax rate guidance is now adding about  relative to what we were thinking going into this quarter for the rest of the year and yet youre not changing eps guidance so any color there would be helpful as well thank you dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc yeah elisha go ahead elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yeah jeff so let me take the tax first so yes it was lower than we expected in q it ended up being roughly an exact offset to the reduction in the proton gross profit that we were expecting so we hit the high end of the guidance range for the quarter although the geography was a little different for the balance of the year we continue to believe that tax is going to be now we think in the  to  range which will get you up to about call it  for the year we had previously guided  to  so were getting about a point improvement in the tax rate largely offset by the proton gross profit and i think we said last quarter the biggest unknown in this whole – doing the discontinued operations and spinning out of varex the tax rate was kind of the cloudiest if you will for us to see the good news is we were able to shave out a point and again we think the full year closer to  which should be sustainable going forward so in the guidance again because we got an improvement in the tax rate the gross profit for the year for protons were losing somewhere around  million or  million so that tax is an offset to that the gross profit for oncology right in line with what we were expecting in the call it the  to  range sga maybe  million or  million high but within our expectations so we simply raised the midpoint at this point in the quarter from  to  for the balance of the year and came off the low end of that guidance number does that answer your question dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc yes i think on the revenue side really on the timing of protons elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yes dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc proton deals thats the shoring up of the bottom end of the revenue guidance elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yes jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc okay and dow maybe one followup just on the proton side so when i think back five six years ago when you first announced the scripps deal and the balance sheet risk with that i think one of the explanations was you had to get a win on the board and if you had to put the balance sheet at risk to kind to get a win on the board that makes sense over the last few years theres been a couple of other financing deals you guys have been involved with but theyve been big systems they are multiroom systems and we kind of thought as we go to singleroom systems and youve got  now  orders out there you didnt have to prove yourself anymore on this new deal singleroom system you still have to put the balance sheet at risk so i guess what is driving that need to continue to put the balance sheet at risk now that you have plenty of orders out there youve proven yourself the orders are getting smaller yet youre still having to get involved to get these things over the finish line dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc i think i mean first of all when you look at this deal delray its about  million of capitalization we are  million of it as i mentioned in the script we think theres a few more like that these are deals that look pretty good to us from a profitability point of view it remains difficult to finance having said that when you look at the risk when you look at the rampup of centers pretty much every center that we have and that we know about as weve looked at that rampup on these singleroom systems they get to profitability pretty quickly so the issue has been these three and four room centers have a lot of capital in them and the breakeven point is much much higher on these singleroom systems the breakeven point is much lower we think theyll get to those volumes very quickly should be able to be refinanced and if we can help bootstrap that and get it going were very much into it so we did view this segment as this compact segment as a distinct segment to the proton market we will use our balance sheet selectively there we are vetting the risks very carefully so that were in with others were looking very hard at the referral networks and patient volumes to make sure they can get to those levels and if we do it its also a profitability case the interest income is not negligible on these loans elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yes if i could just add one thing to that i mean this is a developer deal with proton international everybody has some skin in game in this particular deal jeff so the doctors have money in everybody came together to get this to happen and it was oversubscribed on the muni financing by a significant amount so we took that as great news that there is a real market for financing these oneroom centers jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc thank you dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc yeah and maybe id just add were not going to go crazy on this we might if everything went our way maybe two more of these in the next  to  months i mean at the high end three so its not going to be we still got maryland out there im sorry not maryland weve still got emory out there that weve talked about and then supporting a few of these compact deals as well next question operator our next question comes from the line of amit hazan of citi please proceed with your question amit hazan  citigroup global markets inc thanks good afternoon guys and elisha and spence thanks for all the help over the years and good luck in the next chapter elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc thank you spencer r sias  varian medical systems inc thank you amit hazan  citigroup global markets inc so let me just actually start with orders first and go to the us environment i mean if im just kind of reading or understanding your comments correctly it sounds like software was very strong the implication being that hardware was maybe a little bit less strong and so im just wondering in the us market did you see any changes in purchasing patterns with the uncertainty going on or has it been pretty much the same dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc id say its been pretty much the same we feel very good about the first half orders performance in the us so thats been looking at the half its been strong and frankly looking back five or six quarters its been very steady one of the things that we liked this quarter was the software volume was up so i mean equipment bounces around a little bit its a little bit lumpier the software volume was up doubledigit and we were very pleased about that id say no real difference in the us market amit hazan  citigroup global markets inc okay and then maybe let me jump to cash flow actually so thinking about it in  this came up a few times free cash flow was down a lot like  or so i think in  free cash flow conversion used to be really strong in the s or so cash flow looked kind of weak again this quarter maybe give us some color on whats going on there and what we should expect for the rest of the year elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc sure so amit again just given the spin let me clarify that cash flow from operations is not on a continuing operations basis so you typically dont try and go back and parse the cash flow from operations from one entity to the other so for the first half and i always like to look at this more i mean youre going to get quarterly fluctuations for the first half cash flow from operations was  million we estimate again this is not a number that will show up in a public filing but we believe that about  million of that is attributable to varian with the rest being attributable to varex remember weve also had significant transaction expenses associated with the spin and on hiring people to get ready for the spin so if you were to just add maybe we still have some transaction expenses that have not been paid yet but even if you add somewhere around  million  million of that being in transaction and the first half is usually about  of the full year which gets you up around  million  million for varian standalone for the year and what weve said is our hope is that we were  million with varex and it would be probably closer to around  million so i think were somewhat in that were in that ballpark as we speak amit hazan  citigroup global markets inc let me just sneak one more and then ill jump back in so back to the operating margin just as a followup to the earlier question so i think in your pro forma numbers that you guys filed it looked like your operating margin is kind of as varian as a standalone post – without the spin or after the spin is about  in fiscal  i think youre talking about  to  for this year it sounds like this was a onetime type of item on the proton side this quarter correct me if im wrong but is the aspiration here for the rest of the year is  or so is the right number for the rest of the year are you going to have lingering proton operating margin issues how should we think about operating margin line for the rest of the year elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc youre absolutely right i mean once you pencil this out you will see pro forma continuing operations for all of last year we were  if you look at the guidance q to q we will be right around  what that means for the year – and again i am excluding the impact of the proton ar writeoff so you guys can figure out how you want to reflect that but for the full year it puts us  to  operating margin which is where we thought we were going to be this time last quarter so were not coming off that number amit hazan  citigroup global markets inc thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of anthony petrone of jefferies please proceed with your question anthony petrone  jefferies llc great and congratulations again elisha and dow sic spencer  thanks for all of the help through the years here just to stick on proton for a moment just want to clarify what exactly is in guidance and what may be potentially still represents upside and so if im hearing you correctly dow the delray order and the order in thailand are now factored into guidance and then there are several other orders i guess two to four orders including emory that represent upside to guidance is that sort of a fair statement elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc so anthony just to clarify we – when we start the beginning of the year we have our backlog of what if you will of proton orders that we believe were going to book throughout the year and as soon as we book an order we start taking revenue under the percentage of completion so the timing of those orders can impact revenue and clearly thats why we came down a little bit on the revenue forecast for the balance of the year so the delray deal it was already in our forecast so the only upside at this point is the emory deal weve been very transparent that it is because it is one of these very large fiveroom centers in the midst of getting their muni bond financing put together we have not included that in our numbers because it has the potential to swing it very significantly anthony petrone  jefferies llc and just to clarify on the swing i think from my notes last quarter it was a  to  swing the earlier in the year it was finalized i mean what is the update on that now just considering the time on the calendar that has passed elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yes its still in that ballpark i mean it would have more significance on the orders and the revenue because we will start to well start taking earnings on that but that will obviously flow all the way throughout the installation and acceptance of the equipment so that will be several years anthony petrone  jefferies llc great and then just a followup on balance sheet utilization within proton and maybe across the business maybe just an update on in aggregate how many protonrelated loans or loan products are held on the balance sheet and in particular to the scripps loan is that completely writtenoff at this point thanks elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc no so currently we have  million in the balance on the scripps loan that was after we sold  million to jpmorgan a number of years ago maryland our loan amount is  million new york just shy of  million and then we add delray so what is that about  million allin at this point anthony petrone  jefferies llc thanks operator our next question comes from the line of tycho peterson of jpmorgan please proceed with your question tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc dow im wondering if you could and congrats to elisha and spencer dow im wondering if comment on pricing dynamics you talked about the competitive wins in the us as you go to kind of swap out some of these competitor vaults are you able to hold on the pricing dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc our pricing dynamics continue to be okay elekta remains aggressive i dont know that they are any more or less aggressive than theyve been in the past and weve seen pretty good engagement i will say that one of the things that was a little unique about the quarter is that the takeouts were broadbased across all our competitors we had good takeouts against accuray good takeouts of old siemens product as well as a few elekta units so it was pretty broadbased and thats something that weve seen in the past i dont know that thats it might be a little bit more on the quarter but not materially more i think when you look at the last half truebeam pricing remains pretty solid and clearly upselling with edge and getting some positive mix the us market continues to be pretty good other americas activity it can be aggressive from time to time but in the us the pricing environment has been pretty stable tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc i know you talked about the us holding up i mean the data points from ge philips and some of the others has been a little more mixed i mean is there any risk to you guys because you guys are late cycle there may be a little bit of a lag effect dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc certainly not anything that were seeing at this point tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc okay dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc if anything i think that the strength of the portfolio and the rumored product introduction in a couple of weeks weve if anything maybe well even see it pick up a little bit tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc and i guess on that point you talked about seeing strength in emerging markets with some of the higherend systems i mean can you maybe just directionally give us a sense of where you see a gap in the portfolio from a linac perspective dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc yes i mean first of all i got the week wrong but come to new york well talk extensively about it in two weeks and if you like opera come to vienna weve – the european society of radiation oncology meeting is in vienna right before that and weve – as weve kind of talked what these emerging markets are looking for is really highquality imrt theyre looking for very fast highquality imaging they dont want to make any tradeoff in the quality of care and then they want to do both in patients and thats kind of the when you think of it in market needs maybe the other thing id add is simplicity they want a high level of automation they want to go fast they dont want the training burden that certainly the industry was a long time ago and as we think about as we think about the market needs i think weve got some really exciting news coming and look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc all right and then just last one maybe for elisha on the revised profitability estimate on the uk project that was all due to currency or were there any adjustments around utilization assumptions elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc its largely currency tycho just the pound being at a historical low tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brandon henry of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc yeah thanks for taking my question theres been a lot of concern from the investor base about the companys lengthening cash conversion cycle particularly as it relates to inventories and receivables so can you give any specifics there that can help us get more comfortable around what you guys are doing to improve these metrics elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yes well first of all ar since the beginning of the fiscal year is actually down  and while revenue is up  so we are making considerable inroads into – weve had – we told you a year or so ago we had a salesforcecom implementation we moved our collections staff collections continue to be quite robust and the dso for oncology is down  days quarteroverquarter to  so whats driving as proton grows that will drive the dso up just because of this percentage of completion accounting where revenue and earnings are taken in advance of when the actual payments are due from the customer inventory is only up very slightly from the beginning of the year just in line with revenue so i think were making good progress remember on this cash flow from operations again significant transaction cost included in those numbers brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc okay and then a separate question i think you guys have started to talk about a potential launch for a new linac later in fiscal year  are there any details you can give us regarding this product what features or margin profile it may have and then what geographies you are going to target for this launch dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc i mean  as i just said well see you in vienna or new york weve got a very exciting product i think were confident it will be margin accretive and come hear about it with the rest of our customers in two weeks so i think it will be a very exciting launch brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc okay and one last one for me can you give us an update on what kind of trends youre seeing in the chinese radiation oncology market and then can you give us any updated timing on when a class a quota might be announced dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc well i think our china business has been very robust for a good strong period of time we were up  this quarter our team is executing very well in that market weve been doubledigitish for many quarters in a row we just had a users meeting in china we had over  attendees so very good reception our market share is a leadership position now in china so were comfortable that the share is going in the right direction and the whole market – i wouldnt get – yeah there are category a category b issues but we got to watch the whole market here and the whole market is moving and as i said in the script we are well on our way to a  million business weve got a great portfolio and we think the news that youre going to see in a couple weeks its going to require – itll probably require some regulatory approvals in china but its going to be very meaningful for that market as well brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc okay and then are you aware of a new class a quota or is that still kind of tbd dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc not aware brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of vijay kumar of evercore isi please proceed with your question dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc hi vijay vijay kumar  evercore group llc hey guys how is it going dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc well vijay kumar  evercore group llc elisha again i wish you all the best for your next chapter you too spencer and maybe on i guess the guidance so revenue is down by  bps and eps up at the low end can you just explain or walk me through on what changed between the revenue line and the eps elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yeah so the revenue line is exclusively due to proton and just some timing of orders primarily because as you know under percentage of completion at the time we book an order we start to recognize revenue over the life of that project completion so timing of orders is driving that oncology continues to be right where we were at the last quarter so eps again its just a little bit of difference in geography on the pl but the gross profit and decline versus what we were expecting in proton almost an exact offset to the point improvement for the year that were expecting in the tax rate and so thats why we were able to come off the midpoint come up  come off the bottom of the eps range vijay kumar  evercore group llc got you and then the backlog i guess the way the accounting works is now im assuming youre pulling off some of the imaging components maybe a couple of hundred million dollars whats been the backlog growth for the last few quarters because i guess i dont have the historical numbers here apart from the second quarter numbers right which just include the oncology piece and the proton piece so can you give us a sense for what its been over the last few quarters under the new reporting methodology elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc sure so you are correct that varex came out of the backlog so as of q lets see before we carved it out for disc op it was the backlog was  billion we are now at  billion so youre right a couple of hundred million dollars came out for the varex group as of q oncology  billion were still  billion which was up  quarter over quarter we do have a decline in the proton backlog because we did book delray but we have yet to book that thailand order and weve been taking revenue over the course of this year so oncology backlog is strong up  at  billion vijay kumar  evercore group llc i guess i was looking for some historical information is there can you provide some historical information over the last – what its been under the new reporting segments either on the pl and the backlog i guess a part of the issue is when i try to look back whats happened over the last year i guess the quarterly numbers its hard for us to parse out under the new reporting methodology so if you can have that information i think that will be really helpful for us maybe one for you dow bigpicture question i think on the competitive side your competitors making some noise about mr linac and i know you have a certain view on this but im just curious on what youre hearing about in the marketplace – and i am just curious about the timing of the new products that you guys are launching is this sort of in response to what competition is doing or are these two things completely unrelated dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc i mean the short version is there is number one we believe that mr imaging is important thats been growing in importance in radiation oncology and we use that imaging for treatment planning and guidance literally every day today were not convinced that mr in room is more than a small niche and that remains to be seen how big a niche thats going to be and at least in terms of as we think about our focus were looking at a product that can have a global impact i like to think of this in terms of today were at  units in our installed base the world needs at a minimum another  machines and it needs to replace another  machines so how do we really grow the sockets that are doing radiation therapy many countries in the world have less than  of their cancer patients are getting radiation as part of their therapy in the west that number is around  and theres just a huge opportunity there so thats kind of how i view the global play and then from a technology point of view we do agree that adaptation is important and thats one of the things that mr is bringing but you can do adaption in lots of ways it doesnt have to be with mr so i think you will see us compete very aggressively for kind of the top technology space with ongoing coformality and adaptation kinds of plays along with simplicity and automation so i think were but when we look at the markets i mean for us its how do we do  more machines vijay kumar  evercore group llc got you thank you guys operator we have a followup question from the line of anthony petrone please proceed with your followup anthony petrone  jefferies llc thanks dow maybe just on the regulatory pathway for the system and timing there and if this is included in guidance at all thanks dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc the short version is ill talk to you in two weeks i mean i think weve got a very exciting product its from a guidance point of view very minimal its we are largely talking about ongoing impact and orders impact which of course we do not guide to so but very excited about the product and we can talk more about kind of the regulatory process when we see you in new york elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc but anthony its more of an fy  on the revenue side dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc on the pl side elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc on the pl side yeah anthony petrone  jefferies llc yeah that helps thanks operator we have another followup question from the line of jeff johnson of robert w baird please proceed with your question jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc thanks elisha just quickly dow r wilson  varian medical systems inc hey jeff jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc hey dow so just very quickly is there a way can provide us with just accounts receivable number maybe over the last couple of years in the first two quarters of this year for just the oncology business kind of exprotons and obviously exvarex elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc i dont have it now jeff youre saying on a go forward basis jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc yeah on a go forward basis or maybe you could post at some point on the website elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc sure jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc yeah because i think a lot of the focus here recently on the working capital has been on the ar side and the accounting for the proton stuff i think obviously as you described is one of the big impacts but if we can see on the core business the   of the business that is oncology those ars are improving that issue is solving itself and maybe wed feel incrementally better on that elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc absolutely and i think the first thing to make you feel good is again oncology dso down  days quarteroverquarter and roughly flat with q so i think weve started to stabilize jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc yeah it would be just be good if we could have those numbers and kind of play with them ourselves but i appreciate it thank you elisha w finney  varian medical systems inc yeah okay operator there are no further questions over the audio portion of the
