view – july you are herehomemarket viewmarket view – july  independence day we at hope everyone had a great th of july weekend celebrating the united states independence we would like to thank everyone who served in one of our military branches helping maintain our freedom  the united states is the home of the free because of the brave greece greece has been in the spotlight for many years now due to their dysfunctional economic system we believe it’s only a matter of time until greece defaults on its sovereign debt at some level – either partially or completely if that happens it is likely that european countries will have to issue new debt to cover their losses on greek bonds in that case there will be upward pressure on interest rates especially in the eurozone but that same pressure can push us bond rates as well rather than independence greece seems bent on dependence on other people’s money in fact after several years working toward some very minor marketfriendly reforms this past january greece elected a farleft government which is marching toward socialism by fighting reality… in the name of dignity in a show of disarray the government called for a july th vote on whether to accept the imfeurozoneecb “troika” bailout offer which would require spending and pension cuts what many greek pensioners might not realize is that whether they accept the troika bailout or not cuts will come in either case if greece leaves the euro and returns to their own drachma pensions will be paid in drachmas – the near equivalent of monopoly money prime minister alex tsipras convinced the people that a “no” vote would strengthen his negotiating stance that itself implies a desire to stay in the euro but i see little chance that can happen now – or at least as a full member however tsipras is negotiating in a manner making last minute changes which make one wonder if he really wants to be kicked out of the euro how can germany and other responsible nations or the imf now negotiate away part of the greek debt that is what tsipras hopes to achieve but should the imf germany et al agree to debt forgiveness wouldn’t italy spain portugal and others be tempted to threaten to leave the euro so they too might erase half their debt if there is the possibility of contagion i would argue that it is by allowing debt erasure regardless of the ultimate outcome the greek economy makes up only  of the eurozone and  of the world’s gdp the problem is causing shortterm volatility in world markets but we believe the ultimate outcome is most dire for the greek people us economic outlook due to unusually heavy snowfall and a west coast port strike along with a skyrocketing dollar the st quarter gdp was slightly negative and got off to a slow start however recent economic statistics indicate the second half of q and the rest of the year will have  gdp strong vehicle sales rising wages and employment a stronger housing market and the continued benefit of low energy prices are all bullish signs of growth the continued strength of the dollar is a headwind for us exports but is benefitting companies who source goods elsewhere and sell them here lower gasoline prices benefit us all but are especially significant for the lowincome consumer we continue to position portfolios to benefit from these trends the fed  interest rates while greece is a tiring and an overplayed topic so is the speculation about the fed and when they will raise shortterm interest rates fed chairwoman janet yellen and a majority of the board of the federal open market committee have held the fed funds rate near  for over  years much too long in our opinion as such many investors are significantly underestimating the impact of rising rates on bonds and especially bond funds bond etfs and targetdate funds many investors believe history is future and since  interest rates have declined and investors have been conditioned to believe that bonds provide a “riskfree return” but today rates are very low and are likely to rise – an environment in which bonds may surprise many by providing a “returnfree risk” instead some bemoan an upcoming fed rate hike will be a dagger in a bloated stock market we disagree we believe the “bubble” is in bonds not in stocks in  there was less than trillion in bond funds and bond etfs there is now over  trillion that is such a large number that there are almost no buyers left when rising interest rates finally prick the bond bubble fund managers will be desperate to sell bonds to satisfy a tidal wave of bond fund shareholders who will be scrambling for redemptions like greeks at an atm bond math gets thrown out the window when the supply of bonds for sale greatly outstrips the demand for purchase we saw this at the end of  and early  when we bought many high quality bonds at significant discounts if this does not occur before we expect it will as europe and then japan approach the end of their respective qe quantitative easing programs in september ’ when that time comes you can expect that we will be buying investment grade bonds at significant discounts again is the market overvalued pe price to earnings ratios can be useful when comparing similar companies say pfizer and merck but the ratio is often misused as if it alone measured the risk of a company or a market the basic problem with pe ratios is people forget there are two variables price and earnings and the ratio tells you where you are not where you are going low pe ratios often indicate a bargain but sometimes low pe’s are a sign that prices have dropped ahead of dropping earning and prices will continue down in  i imagine buggy whip manufacturers looked like bargains as the share price dropped but earnings continued falling as more people chose to purchase automobiles – making the buggy whips a classic value trap at years end in  and  the market was at very low pe’s and we all know how that went and at the end of  the sp had a market pe over  yet the following years provided excellent returns pe’s like other measurement tools must be considered like the independent variables they are point is that the pe of a stock or a market is just one measure – sometimes it is valuable input and sometimes not don’t let someone try to convince you that a  or  pe on the sp  makes it fully valued or overvalued or undervalued it depends on where earnings are headed the other assumption of an overvalued market would be that you own every sector of the market some sectors have very low pe’s and others have very high ones if you were to choose on pe alone last fall when oil had dropped to barrel you would have loaded up on oil companies – a bad idea when oil is oversupplied and prices are dropping see chart of exxon one must look at what is going on – the  foot view as we refer to it to determine whether earnings are likely to rise or fall as earnings almost always are the ultimate determiner of price astrotech astc since this is a small company that we have owned for a couple of years and many of you are not that familiar with what they do i want to share with you some background and some notes i took at the shareholder meeting last week in webster tx just outside of nasa astrotech sold its satellite launching and international space station iss shuttle businesses to lockheed martin last september for million lockheed will pay the final m this september raising astrotech’s cash to over  million share in cash on a  priced share astc is now focused on its subdivision called st detect which has numerous patents on a shoebox sized mass spectrometer original funding came from nasa who wanted a small mass spectrometer to use on the iss in case you are not familiar a mass spectrometer is used to analyze the mass and relative concentration of atoms and molecules of a sample which is “sniffed” it can be used to sniff milk on a production line immediately alerting if there is a problem or telling the producer how many days before it spoils or it may be used on a drone and flown high above smoke stacks to determine what is being manufactured below or in hospitals to check the breath of an unconscious person to determine if there has been a heart attack of some other problem to determine the type of poison in a small child etc several government agencies such as the military tsa and dea are interested for bomb or drug detection astrotech hired many nasa engineers with expertise in mass spectrometry to design and develop the st detect mass spectrometer over the past seven years it is now available for sale and should be available at large quantities later this year theirs is not only portable and cost about  typically mass spectrometers are very expensive k to m and are very large and heavy  to  pounds but it is capable of stateoftheart analytics and has a refresh time of a few seconds versus the more typical  minute to several hours between samples at the shareholder meeting i found that astrotech has received a m contract from the military to “ruggedize” the machine for field use that is allowing astc to make improvements which are also helpful on factory floors it already has a meantime between failure of over  years and is now running  to test deliveries are expected by november st with customers in hand now and astc will present at the gcc convention in late october expecting to meet with  to  potential customers each of which could possibly utilize from a few to a few thousand units in addition to sales there is also a plan for recurring income by leasing units with realtime analytics as many companies such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductor fabricators prefer to lease and receive the instant analytics we still expect this stock to go much higher but it may be another six to nine months before enough sales are reported to propel the price in the meantime please understand that the small trading volume will push the price high and low but we do expect very good results from this company sincerely the beck capital team copyright warning and notice it is a violation of federal copyright law to reproduce all or part

seeking income and capital growth with less than market volatility  we follow an investment philosophy and research process that is grounded in time tested models of valuation  our “growth at a reasonable price” and “model growth” templates drive our research process which is rigorous repeatable and databased  all of our research is conducted inhouse with institutional grade databases and tools we begin with a macroeconomic “ foot view” that incorporates industry sector developments secular trends money flows monetary policies and news events  dr lewis spellman our macroeconomist provides key guidance in this area with his expertise and focus on federal reserve monetary policy interest rate trends foreign currencies and income  employment statistics when selecting individual securities in more mature businesses and industries we search for positive revenue  earnings growth expanding gross  operating margins and high return on equity  we seek to buy these businesses when their stock price reflects reasonable valuation relative to their intermediate term growth rate  for younger more dynamic businesses and industries we are less sensitive to valuation  in this case we are looking for industry leaders  young industryleading companies exhibit very rapid growth in revenue and earnings a high percentage of sales spent on research and development and high return on equity  they also often create defensible and unique intellectual property which drives new and exciting products services or technologies as a feebased investment manager with a fiduciary duty to our clients “clients first” is how we operate each and every day  our research is factbased and unbiased  further we have no investment banking relationships  we avoid business conflicts of interest but should there ever be a situation where there is even the smallest conflict of interest we begin the conversation by acknowledging and explaining the conflict  our priority to client results is also reflected in our sensitivity to transaction costs and capital gains taxes  our business has grown over the years due to two simple factors goal congruence with our clients and excellent
