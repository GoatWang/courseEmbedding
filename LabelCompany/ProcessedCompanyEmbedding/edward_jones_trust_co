require inquiry or indepth investigation for this bank we have noted net interest marginoverheadinstitution commentaryoverview of institutionedward jones trust company which as of march   reported  million in total assets at that date loans and deposits held by the bank amounted to  thousand and  thousand respectively the banks march   equity base of  million produced an equityassets ratio of  as of that date composite summary bankrate believes that as of march   this bank exhibited a superior condition characterized by approximately normal overall sustainable profitability a very high measure of asset quality very strong capitalization and ample liquidity earnings analysis for the twelve months ended march   the bank recorded net income of  million the bank experienced a return on average assets roa of  over the latest four quarters year earlier twelve month results amounted to a net income of  million or a  roa over the most recent four quarters at that time an roa of at least  is deemed satisfactory in accordance with banking industry standards and the industrys annualized roa for the twelve months of  was approximately  for commercial banks and  for thrift institutions we have concluded that for the four quarters ending march   the bank achieved a good return on equity we deem net interest margin to have been substantially below average and the reported percentage should cause inquiry into balance sheet composition asset yields and liability costs noninterest income was solid we also observed overhead ratios that were significantly higher than average and the composition of overhead should be thoroughly analyzed importantly net interest margins noninterest income components and overhead expense levels represent operating factors that combine to impact overall operating results asset quality analysis the bank revealed as previously stated a very high measure of asset quality our conclusion with respect to asset quality incorporates our analysis of data depicting regional economic conditions as well as our computations of a relatively low march   nonperforming asset ratio much better than normal reserve coverage for nonperforming loans and apparently acceptable quality or no greater than average holdings of commercial real estate and construction loans two categories that can intensify credit risk other asset categories such as farm and consumer loans which may carry more than usual default potential should not have a substantial negative impact upon future results loan yield can measure financial reward versus credit risk excessive loan yield may be an indicator of existing or future problems our loan review indicates that the bank has assumed a seemingly prudent position between credit risk and financial reward capital analysis for the one year period ended march   the bank reported a better than normal rate of growth in equity capital balance sheet structural changes through the one year period of time ended march   have highly improved the banks capital position our analytical methodology does take into account the quantity quality and durability of net worth and as set forth above we have determined based upon our series of tests that the bank demonstrates very strong capitalization we have calculated the banks march   total riskbased capital position a computation used by industry regulators and have concluded that this bank substantially exceeded the requirement set by regulation for this test liquidity analysis as of march   the bank displayed much better than normal balance sheet liquidity and a no greater than average dependence upon wholesale or noncore liabilities which include all borrowings such as federal home loan bank advances and cds greater than  accounting principles require some

requiring specific investigation include net interest marginoverheadpredictive indicator as stated we have determined a composite star rating for this bank of   indicative of a superior financial condition at times financial conditions of banks change rapidly and significantly hence our safe  sound star ratings should not be deemed predictive of likely future ratings however in view of early

show more banks ask our experts expert’s answers how do banks work how do i choose a bank what does it mean to be fdic insured how do banks work by john kiernan personal finance editor the manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself banks exist to solve that problem and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the italian renaissance the crusades or even earlier depending on which historians you consult more specifically banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit cds to other customers who repay the money with interest over time depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons  banks offer safekeeping borne from fdic insurance and  banks pay interest on deposits allowing funds to grow over time banks in turn make money by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits banks can have other sources of revenue as well including investments fees on various services and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance in addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms for example banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve how do i choose a bank by odysseas papadimitriou wallethub ceo when it comes to selecting a bank the options can be overwhelming in past generations it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster these days you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an onlineonly bank that has no branch offices at all special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking introductory interest rates or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account but before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you do you need a brickandmortar location you may find yourself in need of a safedeposit box or if questions arise you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with facetoface communication if you need access to a real building staffed by live people prioritize your bank’s location and hours bankers’ hours are notoriously short and if your workday overlaps them completely you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home so that you can slip in at lunchtime or you might want to look for a bank with better hours are you a technophile you may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an onlineonly bank or bank account by the same token you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements keeping tabs on your account balance electronically and using mobile apps to locate atms that are within your network these are great opportunities and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them if your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps it helps to be realistic read through the fine print understand the fees and penalties and decide whether they work for your lifestyle do you travel abroad extensively international financial transactions have never been easier or less laborintensive and while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and atm withdrawals others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers if you’re a frequent international traveler it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market  not only will this enable you to avoid the industrystandard  international surcharge but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since visa and mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks  you should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use nor foreign atm withdrawals is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking since the global financial crisis of  the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye but the banking industry is not a monolithic entity many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development fair lending and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs these institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible  they’re worth a look at the very least what does it mean to be fdic insured by john kiernan personal finance editor if your bank is fdic insured any money you put into a deposit account along with any earned interest will be returned to you even if your bank fails there are limits of course insurance coverage tops out at  per depositor per institution—not per account as some people assume that means if you have  in a money market account and another  in a cd at the same bank you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured it’s important to note that fdic insurance covers deposit accounts only that is checking savings cds and money market accounts other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide such as annuities life insurance and mutual funds including money market funds are not insured most banks and thrifts also known as savings and loan institutions are fdic insured but a few are not by law those that are must display the fdic logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials if you don’t see the logo or if you have any doubts ask about coverage credit unions are not covered by the fdic but they do have an insurance program of their own sponsored by the national credit union administration ncua  as is the case with banks this provides coverage for up to  per depositor per institution the fdic which stands for the federal deposit insurance corporation was founded by the us government in  in response to the widespread bank failures of the great depression fdic insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers commerce other banks and the overall economy and one of the hard lessons of the s and s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank even in the face of frightening economic and financial news in that way it protects not only the consumer but also the banks and the economy community discussion help others find the best banking

of a savings acc with some minimal starting amount in my case opening was  and a checking accwith lets say  for total of this type of acc everyday checking comes with a  monthly service fee which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of now as part of this checkingsavings acc is a scam called save as you go that means that every time you make some electronic transaction like paying a bill usually    or more dollars depending on the amount of the transaction will be transferred from your checking part of the acc to the saving accthe idea is that you are to stupid to manage and save your own money so wells fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savingsas a result of this scam you can find yourself in a position where you have lets say  in your savings acc and  in your checking for a total of so lets assume you make a bill pay to your cable co of  that leaves a balance in your checking acc of  and your so called save as you gosavings acc still has the  for a total of here is the kicker remember you checking had  you paid the cable co  you have left  but because well fargo moved  dollar to your savings your savings amount became  and your checking at  in your checking you are below the  and therefore you are subject to a  monthly service fee even though you still have  in your savingsnow i am sure that those very young smart highly educated people in the wells fargo boardroom get a lot of money paid to find ways that will boost the banks profits but ultimately a pig with a lipstick is still a

rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk you should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term if your accounts have not gone past  days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep or by sending along a goodwill letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late there are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts you should begin by puling your free annual credit report from httpswwwannualcreditreportcom so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts once you have a better picture of where you credit is now you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you i would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as lexington law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own you may wish to

little money i decided to just keep it there because i was too busy dealing with so much i totally regret it because it seems after about  months i will owe them money when i transfer my money please beware they are very expensive and do not look out for youhelpfulyesnorobert of the villages fl on june  satisfaction ratingwe joined edward jones in   we finally escaped in  with minimal losses in the stocks recommended to us two of the stocks we chose gained significantly  apple and amazon  our brokers sniffed at both we invested k in a recommended mutual fund after one year we had gained a whopping  that was erased by a  management fee from their experts we were audited recently for that year received no s from ej so wound up paying k in taxes penalties interest and back taxes appealed and received a k refund from the irs based on the fact that edward jones had overreported our profits these people are not your friends or even competent investment counsel lord run awayhelpfulyesnodiane of raleigh nc on june  satisfaction ratingi have worked with the company for the last six months during that time i dealt with an advisor who was very sarcastic in his ways of communication his way of describing something when i would not agree to his advice was by saying best wishes and hanging up the phone on me i know what this phrase meant it means stick it somewhere i will not go into further detail as i think most people can read between the lines i finally decided to remove this advisor and was given another from the same company the new person was very professional initially i liked him however he then contacted an estate attorney that is working with my late fathers finances i agree i did give him the phone number but did not instruct him to call either please please please consult me before you take the initiative that you think is in my best interest without my consent to make a long story short i am moving on to a new firm that may value my business and respect me too if you feel as i do this may not be the firm for you to do business withhelpfulyesnoirene of hoquiam wa on june  satisfaction ratinggot a phone call from the financial advisor he says we can get rid of your husbands roth ira if you want to downsize the amount of accounts you guys have i said okay if that is what you recommend then tax time came our accountant informed us that because we closed the roth ira  months too early that there is a penalty and fine to pay okay so we did that then research was needed to find out what the profits were from the account this is needed to pay another fine and that fine would be  of the profits we found out that the account after  years had a loss so at least we did not have to give away more dollarson another note we had put  into our simple ira the advisor says we can put into your traditional too so i wrote a check our accountant said no no you cannot do both for that year it took a few hours of phone calls and emails to get that straightened out we ended up leaving the money in the ira accounts because the irs does not like you to remove the money once it is there so we have taxed and nontaxed dollars in our traditional ira accounts now our accountant says he is keeping track for us of what is real ira dollars and what are not i highly recommend that if you are getting advice from a financial advisor to go to your accountant to find out if what they are telling you to do is correct this can save you from doing costly mistakes that take up a lot of time to fix and figure outhelpfulyesnorobert of pueblo west co on may  satisfaction ratingedward jones  columbia dr pueblo co   oh i read the important information about doing business with edward jones and i couldnt find the part where they said it was alright for their financial advisors to lie to their clients in order to get the extra financial bonus that they receive that left me losing  plus had  in a lincoln annuity and was getting  a year or  a month  my financial adviser  said she could get me  a year all i had to do was leave it in for  year before i took anything out so she had edward jones take that much out so i would still be getting  and i ended up with  guess i should have been adding up the numbers because there is  missing right there she just happen to quit or was canned after  months wonder how much she got for this lieso ej put in a new financial adviser  went in after that st year  and the annuity was worth  and i wanted to start taking my money out  told me all i could draw out was  so now i was only getting  a month went in  and asked  how much this thing was worth because like  said the numbers looked kind of fuzzy he told my wife and me said i dont blame you but as long as dont take any more than im taking now it was worth  should have went to a real financial adviser for advice because this just cost me another  for the year went in  and  says oh i dont think you are getting any interest on this so he makes a call to aig and says it was only worth  guess they heard about the fiduciary clause and thought if they started to tell the truth now it was alright theyve done this to other people too because the secretary a  who was an accomplice to  and should have been canned with her had this line to says you made  dollars and you will always get  dollars for the rest of your life i guess this worked with other people who had to have this money to survive lets see that means i made  of  a year for three years talked to a vanguard agent and in order to transfer this to them would cost me  to get out of this phony deal with ej and the aig annuity could have put this money in a can in the shed in my back yard and been  ahead so now i dont take any money out just to get my  which in reality is only  a year it will take me another  years to get back to  so made no money for  years they used my money i would think ej would do background checks on these people being the reputable company they are just dont google themso when they sent me a letter to make them custodians of my account in dec i told my wife that it looked like they were trying to steal the other  so i found a real ej financial adviser on the north side of pueblo and transferred it to his office  x    and      and  to surrender the lincoln annuity and  to dump this turkey with aig grand total of  this is pretty apparent that they were working for their best interest and not their client didnt seem like it would do any good to do their complaint dept everybody just gets the runaroundhelpfulyesno how do i know i can trust these reviews about edward jones  reviews on consumeraffairs are verified we require contact information to ensure our reviewers are realwe use

finch it was  a share at the time he didnt take my order but said he would look at nash finch to see if it was a good investment later that day i visited him again and he recommended against it because of debt in place he recommended  mutual funds putman new growth opportunity and  hartford funds  in each the result putman went from  to  with no call from broker the hartford funds went down about  again no call from broker in the same period nash finch went from  to  per share decided to do my own thing for awhile and was successful but did not like do it so decided to try an edward jones broker that some of my relatives had used went to see him and went through my portfolio with himi had bought a drug company called ivax he asked me about it and i told him i bought it because the leader of the company was always buying back its stock he told me i should sell and buy pfizer which was at  a share and i did so on his recommendation what happened pfizer went down to  without a call while ivax got bought out by teva the israel drug company and took off again traded on own buying adding a new stock mdu to my portfolio went to see new edward jones broker asking to buy more mdu his response was i needed more diversity and suggest bank of america at  a share once again went down to  a share with no call from brokerin addition to these gems they also recommended citi bonds a burn job and some williston basin stock also a bust i believe my edward jones representatives made as much in my account as i did closed one account that was basically in cash last friday and it is now wednesday and transfer still has not hit bank tempted to sue for lack of fiduciary responsibility believe this is widespread enough it could be a class actionhelpfulyesnomagdalena of bellevue wa on april  satisfaction ratingin october  after having met with an edward jones financial advisor in kirkland washington for the first time i was advised that my financial situation allowed me to retire at  years of age instead of having to wait until  she transferred everything i had from fidelity to edward jones saying there would be a onetime charge of  and nothing thereafter i thought that was high but liked the idea of no further charges she placed me into  different mutual funds with american and franklin funds advising that it was to diversify it wasnt until i went to a retirement seminar months later that it was brought to my attention that i had been charged  not  and that i would be charged an annual fee ranging from  to  from each of the mutual fundsmorningstar ranks mutual funds from  stars bronze silver and gold i found out that  out of my  funds were bronze usually  stars with below average returns for  andor  years as well as their being high risks for   andor  years when i asked her about this she became angry that i was questioning her i realized i could no longer trust her and therefore could no longer work with her i sold all of my funds and transferred the cash back to fidelity where it has remained as cash since i am afraid to trust anyone again i placed a complaint with edward jones requesting that my  commission be returned to me for all that had happened i had only been with ej for about  months i was just told my complaint had been deniedif i had known then what i know now about edward jones i would never have gone with them i think their customer service has been terrible i have had to call them repeatedly to see where my complaint stood i feel they did not listen to anything i was saying they do not record their conversations and they do not allow you to see your record so it was my word against theirs and of course they believed their advisor over me i have tried to work this out with them but they have refused to work with me my only option now is to contact finra to see what they can do to helphelpfulyesnovic of willits ca on april  satisfaction ratingit takes a lot to inspire me to write a review good or bad my experience with edward jones has been the worst financial related experience in my life there was a total lack of concern to get my and our employees money invested properly one employee never got his money into an account at all as he thought he had his deductions just went into a money market fund making nothing for a year no one at ej bothered to say anything to him or follow up with any of us my funds also languished in this money market fund for many weeks of the choices told to me i picked  no contact from them telling me one fund was not really available i had to contact them to ask why nothing was going into my chosen funds then they say oh you have to wait for us to mail you a new form and mail it back seriously  more weeks wasted then my bimonthly deposits would not show up in my account sometimes a month later long story short our company chose to move our accounts over to adp then ej takes weeks of prodding to make this happen then rather than transferring funds into our adp k accounts they send all our checks to the owner of the company no notice to anyone so the checks sit in a mail box for some time before the owner comes home and finds them in the mail now none of us knows how to properly get these funds deposited into our adp k accounts as they are not made out to us individually never do business with ej especially in sandpoint idahohelpfulyesnoarla of park city ut on march  satisfaction ratingafter over  years with edward jones i closed my account in january  received all tax info except for one was sent with incomplete figures and was checking weekly with the online access for those final figures with no prior warning or communication i discovered this week that my online access is now denied for the accounts as they are closed when i inquired about this with both my local investment office and the online help  number the response was basically too bad so sad i do my taxes electronically and now cannot pull those figures over electronically as i no longer have the access to that information warning to anyone else who has or is thinking about closing edward jones accounts frankly in this day and age and electronic environment it is beyond logic that this business practice exists at the very least the accounts information and accessibility should remain available until after april th of each yearhelpfulyesnobrenda of sebring fl on march  satisfaction ratingi went edward jones in january  thinking i didnt know too much and put my faith in them i had  plus  shares of home depot as i sat in his office he told me he thought i should sell

satisfaction ratingi had an account with ej for many years and contributed many thousands in fees to them now that i have closed the account they are not allowing me to access my tax info electronically per their policy this means that instead of a simple import into turbotax i now have to manually input into various tax forms the many trades executed by ej from a page statement everyone who closes their account will encounter the same problem other financial institutions that i deal with do allow downloads from closed accounts as you still have to file your taxes on the previous years activity and they have profited from your business by the way the reason i closed my account was that i consistently lost money yearly with them while paying many thousands in fees its a lousy companyhelpfulyesnoed of larkspur co on feb  satisfaction ratingedward jones agent sold me an annuity with many promises of how it would step and lock in new highs every time the market set a

no one wants to help and edward jones doesnt do a thing about misconduct of their brokers i have undisputable proof and received a letter back from their compliance department same experience with the retirement account issue that explained nothing just said they looked into it and that now they considered the case closed no explanation whatsoever its all for show to make the consumer comfortable

in investing with him i would call him he gave me his card and i gave him mine this was early spring last year  a month or so later i started to get emails then phone calls over and over i kept stating i would contact him when i was ready to do anything he just would not give up then he contacted me about some disney stock again he just wouldnt stop so he finally wore me down and we invested  and bought the disney stock and of course he was the only one to make money off of that mistake as soon as it goes up some we are pulling out and i never intend on doing business with edward jones

feebased advisor or someone who at least offers lowcost investment options edward jones fees are insanely high i recently requested a transfer of my edward jones roth ira account to another brokerage because i was tired of paying the annual fee ej ira fee ej charged  to terminate my roth ira account not unusual for a brokerage to do that but what angered me is that ej withheld  from the roth ira transfer until they could verify that i had already paid the  annual fee yes you read that correct they withheld  until they verified i had paid my  dollar annual fee thats twice the amount withheld thus causing me to be put into a margin call status with my new brokerage account wtf i had paid the  annual fee in april so i was all set you mean to tell me they could not check my account statement to see that i had already paid the annual fee before transferring my account now i have to wait  business days for ej to verify that i paid the annual fee and then they will release the  to my new brokerage stay away from edward jones they suck they are horriblehelpfulyesnorandall of cary il on aug  satisfaction ratingfraudulent activity on my retirement account at edward jones edward jones

increased ratingan aunt recently passed away and i along with a few brothers and cousins received notification from an edward jones rep or agent concerning a revocable trust my aunt had to which an edward jones rep accepted the trusteeship and custodianship e j sent a notification letter explaining a bit about the estate settlement process etc while forwarding a copy of the trust will form w etc edward jones was the investment firm my aunt utilized prior to her death the real reason i am concerned is that the edward jones rep is also named as a equal beneficiary of the trust along with my brothers and cousins etc i did not know my aunt real well but i understand she was in a care facility for a number of years prior to her death i have heard a bit about her mental state but will not go into that here am i wrong here to be concerned this just does not sit well with me i was a quite removed from my aunt so i feel fortunate to have been remembered by her at all thank youhelpfulyesnomichelle of columbus in on aug  satisfaction ratingi knew about edward jones and what a bad investment company they were because i researched them before opening my first roth ira at age  i instead went with vanguard that was  years ago for those not in the know ed jones is bad because they fleece you in fees both fixed fees and the variable expenses of their investment picks they make commission off their selections or as they call it revenue sharing they make sure you sign the fine print about that and the fees when you open an account now im sure the people who work for them are nice you probably know a person or two who works or started working for them like insurance they like to hire people college grads anyone and have them focus on their relativesfriends as new leads its why theyre quite popular despite how bad they are now i understand people need to make money but that money should be earned and often times it isntthe companys policies are horrid the financial advisors and most advisors actually are  sales people and  financial knowledge they are a middle man who put you in investments that likely arent in your best interests but theirs if you took a little time and researched basic investment advice you could be a passive investor in a balance or target date mutual fund and probably come out way ahead than going with this company in fact i guarantee you would my personal story is that my small employer decided to switch to ed jones as their retirement expert to handle the employees ks it was really a sep ira but thats what they called it now i wasnt thrilled about this and i believe they made the decision because of personal connections or a mutually beneficial business relationship im not sure it wasnt my call to make so off we switchedfrankly i had to transfer my account over around to ed jones mid may  i then took another job in june with a much larger company guess what funds they offered their employees thats right vanguard and fidelity theres a reason both them and amazon and other big companies use them for their employees now i was given some interesting advice by both the ed jones advisor and his assistant the assistant was insistent i invest right away into their funds i politely declined and kept in cash knowing i was probably going to be switching jobs soon and not wanting to pay transaction feesred flag  she hinted i would have to pay taxes on the whole amount if i didnt invest with them in a certain time now i know i wouldnt have to if the direct transfer was done correctly and i think she knew this with how long shed be working there but i suppose i could be wrong about that and maybe she really didnt know next when i did talk about funds he wanted me to invest  of my portfolio in apple stock red flag  why because investing such a large amount in any one stock is extremely risky the whole dont put your eggs in one basket elementary idea his graph of apples impressive returns over the past  years was nice  all but a little common sense would see through this apple has peaked they went from being relatively forgotten to some bigs wins with the ipod and iphone its unlikely those gains would be seen again at least for the foreseeable futureso no i didnt think now was a good time to get into apple just from my take on where theyre headed the other  mutual funds utilities and a bond fund he had me in were high in fees  ridiculous when youre use to or less usually and to someone who doesnt know better it may not seem like much that  to  fee difference but go plug some numbers into a future value calculator and change the rate of return by  and be in awe of the difference it makes in    years so i switched my work sep ira over to my vanguard ira who did most of the work to transfer it it closed on  i wanted to make sure it was done before  before the annual fee was charged as was indicated online but i should have realized who i was dealing withi got my statement today not only did they charge the close out fee of  also preposterous but this is to discourage you from leaving them they of course charged the annual fee of   to close an account but im not surprised just ticked off that they can charge a years worth of account maintenance for a month and a half of service not even that but of course they dont prorate fees if you havent learned by now from this review and others they arent exactly concerned with going out of their way for the consumerdo yourself a favor by saving time and money by saying no to edward jones and investing on your own going with a feebased advisor or someone who at least offers low cost investment options its easy just go to vanguards website and open an ira you can put up to yr in one put it in a targetretirement fund you chose the year you plan to retire thats it simple youre already better off than doing any investing with ed joneshelpfulyesnotg of league city tx on aug  satisfaction ratingthe e jones advisor wanted to buy

arlington tx on may  satisfaction ratingi originally thought that in opening an account and not using advising services was fee free but as my stock gained value and the gains rolled into new stock purchases i learned  years later that id been paying for reinvesting existing stock so i moved my money and i had to pay  just to close my account which i feel was exorbitant and predatory to consumers and i dont recall agreeing to these feeshelpfulyesnolisa of myrtle beach sc on april  satisfaction ratingi opened my ira account on  i closed my ira account on  so complete length of time i have had my account with edward jones has been   years or about  months however they charged me  years of annual fees i was charged  in may of   in may of   in may of   in may  and then another  in march  even though the fee was not due until may of  so i have only had my account   years but they have charged me  years of fees totalling  i have contacted the  and local office and have only been told we dont prorate the fees however im not asking them to even prorate the fees i am just asking not to be charged for fees i dont owe in addition i had to pay  just to close my account which i feel was exorbitant and predatory to consumers i dont understand how they earned  i filled out all the paperwork myself and at most a wire fee to send money out is only about    it appears edward jones motive is to charge excessive and unearned fees especially the closeout fee which is  times in excess of what the industry standard appears to be then they tried to tell me its for account managementreporting going forward the cost of a stamp is  cents and most irs reporting is done electronically nowadays at a relatively minimal cost additionally im not retiring anytime soon so i dont see how edward jones can justify  other than to say sorry no one explained these fees to you im also concerned at how easily their business practices can take advantage of the elderly or less educated in regards to investing telling people these fees are the norm when they absolutely must be the highest in the industry i do not understand what fiduciary responsibility they have to consumers their sole purpose seems to be to charge their clients exploitative feescharges whether earned or not for the sake of their own profitshelpfulyesnosherry of middletown ri on april  satisfaction ratingmy
