markets and challenge existing industries capital group investment professionals share their insights on how disruptive technology can benefit investors in  predictions many questioned from the movie “back to the future” came true in  as the cubs won the world series and nike began to offer selflacing sneakers whether or not nike’s power laces gain mainstream acceptance the way we live and work is being enhanced by dramatic changes in technology disruptive technologies are the result of new business models that are constantly innovating often their initial products or services appeal to only a small audience of customers however if they can evolve to offer higher quality at lower prices they cause disruption by creating new markets and challenging existing industries “as investors we need to understand not only the opportunities but also the threats to incumbents” notes nick grace a capital group portfolio manager cloud computing is accelerating disruptive technologies cloud computing has been a hugely disruptive force over the past decade driving innovation and in turn enabling new business models many people have a hazy understanding of “the cloud” and whether it will keep their data secure but most are already relying on cloud computing services when they use email online banking and social media in reality the cloud is a global network of massive facilities filled with hardware that runs software to store manage and process data remotely cloud providers such as amazon microsoft and google now rent computing services over the internet in fact amazon’s cloudcomputing platform amazon web services aws is the fastestgrowing business in the history of technology services aws grew its revenue from  million in  to nearly  billion in five years the cloud’s potential is skyhigh amazon web services is the fastestgrowing business in the history of enterprise information technology sources capital group and sec us securities and exchange commission reported company financial filings data are estimates this innovation has allowed large companies to reduce or eliminate the cost of maintaining their own data centers cloud providers also benefit startups by reducing their need to buy technology so they can focus on product development cloudcomputing businesses will continue to have strong investment potential particularly when they are able to dispel remaining security concerns by demonstrating they offer higher standards at lower costs than corporate departments “i think people are likely to be surprised by the accelerated rate at which information technology it needs move to the cloud over the next three years” says capital group portfolio manager mark casey in addition to helping launch new businesses and changing existing practices the cloud is disrupting companies that sell computer hardware and software by sharing resources in the cloud companies no longer need to own computing power that may sit idle or quickly become obsolete machine learning is creating cures cloud computing is increasingly enabling computers to teach themselves by analyzing massive amounts of data from the web smartphones and other internetconnected devices common “machine learning” applications include those that train computers to understand speech and recognize images smartphone virtual assistants now respond to questions and social media can tag names to photos advances in machine learning are having a profound impact on the medical world as well an example is a smartphone app that can detect skin cancer three years ago the technology was  accurate today the app is even more precise — roughly equal to the diagnostic skills of a dermatologist gene sequencing perhaps provides an even greater example it took  years and  billion to sequence the first human genome now the cost of sequencing dna is  and can be done in a few days soon it will cost as little as  and take just one day doctors may then be able to diagnose an illness by comparing a patient’s dna to databases that have already identified factors that contribute to the disease machine learning is also supporting the data analysis that has been integral in the development of new drugs these treatments can be personalized to target the specific nature of a patient’s illness based on their dna “these advances allow us to imagine curing diseases not just treating them” says capital group investment analyst rich wolf many pharmaceutical companies are now spending more money on developing therapies benefiting equipment suppliers with the technology to do the necessary research however drug companies that underinvest in disruptive innovation may need to acquire competitors with a stronger pipeline of potential treatments selfdriving cars hit the road going mobile used to mean going on the road not online the two activities merged with the creation of appenabled car services which have upended the traditional taxi business model by swiftly matching riders with drivers based on proximity and need the services offer clean owneroperated vehicles and convenient pickup arrangements at competitive prices and usually with little or no wait time even during peak ridership hours but what could be the most disruptive technology thus far looks to be just around the corner with the introduction of autonomous or selfdriving vehicles many cars are already equipped with cameras and sensors to help drivers avoid potential accidents now competition is developing not only between traditional automakers such as gm and toyota but also among technology companies like apple and google as they seek to put selfdriving cars on the street as early as  in just two years machine learning has increased by  times the distance driverless vehicles can travel “however it will take more time to develop fully autonomous cars that can safely operate under all road and weather conditions” says capital group investment analyst kaitlyn murphy it is still too early to predict who is most likely to benefit from the use of autonomous cars — manufacturers or operators uber’s profits could very likely increase with the cost of the driver eliminated in addition carsharing services like zipcar could reduce or even eliminate the need to own a vehicle this may reduce auto sales by more than a million units annually over the next decade investing in disruptive technologies it could be argued that the most disruptive technologies are perhaps the ones we never expected and couldn’t imagine capital group takes a longterm view of innovations using fundamental research and a worldwide network of investment professionals to identify and analyze such trends and their impact on industries and companies as they evolve “that global and longterm perspective is what gives us the edge in terms of identifying companies best positioned to take advantage of those innovations” says mark “i’m excited about the ongoing potential for technology innovation to make a meaningful difference in the quality of peoples’ lives as well as in the investment opportunities in businesses that either pioneer those changes or benefit from those changes”

other countries the savicell™ platform is a blood test designed for the early detection of disease it is a broad platform with applications for cancer autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases immunotherapy both for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases is an example where metabolic shift profiles could indicate response to drug treatment initially savicell is focused on the multibilliondollar cancer diagnosis market savicell deploys wellshield™ technology a liquid immunobiopsy™ diagnostic platform in contrast to existing technologies that evaluate secretions of cancer cells wellshields immunobiopsy platform receives data directly from the immune system importantly wellshield is different in that it is a functional test measuring the metabolic activation profile of the immune system as an indicator of disease status as an immune system test it is inherently suited for early detection disease intrusion and cell malformation including cancer are first detected by the immune system which energizes to rid the body of the malignancy the initial immune response to disease is intricate deploying different metabolic pathways and subtypes of cells the wellshield™ technology is designed to detect and interpret these differential metabolic responses the need for simpler and more efficient processes for cancer detection has incentivized some  companies in the usa

announces european patent and additional test results las vegas nevadamarketwired  dec      online disruptive technologies inc otc pinkondr the  company  is pleased to announce that its majority owned israeli subsidiary savicell diagnostic ltd  savicell tm has received patent approval from the european patent offices effective as of sep   title methods of monitoring and analyzing metabolic activity profiles diagnostic and therapeutic uses of same the technology has now received intellectual property protection with a patent approved in the united states china japan and europe furthermore the patent process is ongoing in several other countries the savicell tm platform is a blood test designed for the early detection of disease it is a broad platform with applications for cancer autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases while our focus initially is on early diagnosis of disease we believe our technology may have additional applications in drug response monitoring for therapies that impact immune response immunotherapy both for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases is an example where metabolic shift profiles could indicate response to drug treatment initially savicell is focused on the multibilliondollar cancer diagnosis market savicell deploys wellshield tm technology a liquid immunobiopsy tm diagnostic platform in contrast to existing technologies that evaluate secretions of cancer cells wellshields immunobiopsy platform receives data directly from the immune system importantly wellshield is different in that it is a functional test measuring the metabolic activation profile of the immune system as an indicator of disease status as an immune system test it is inherently suited for early detection disease intrusion and cell malformation including cancer are first detected by the immune system which energizes to rid the body of the malignancy the initial immune response to disease is intricate deploying different metabolic pathways and subtypes of cells the wellshield tm technology is designed to detect and interpret these differential metabolic responses the need for simpler and more efficient processes for cancer detection has incentivized some  companies in the usa to work on creating liquid biopsies in a  report investment bank piper jaffray valued the potential market for liquid biopsies at  billion just in the united states savicell conducted additional tests with a promising crossvalidation of  donors from our clinical study this cohort includes  diseased donors together with a control group of  age and sexmatched healthy donors this practice helps us control for sampling biases table     crossvalidation cv   click to enlarge click to enlarge crossvalidation cv – we let the algorithm train on a large subset of labeled donors and then let it make a prediction on a small subset of unlabeled donors that were not in the training set this process is repeated several times until every donor in the cohort is given a prediction   we use several types of crossvalidation loo – leave one out – one donor is left out of the training set each iteration total of n iterations f – stratified fold cv – the cohort is split into  semiequalsized subsets each subset containing both sick and healthy donors is left out once total of  iterations in addition we run the algorithm once without crossvalidation meaning that the entire cohort is used for training and prediction while we are pleased with these promising results please note that results can change as we increase the cohort size contact giora davidovits

predictions based on current information and expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties forwardlooking statements in this press release include that our technology is designed to be deployed for early detection of diseases that our technology may have additional applications in drug response monitoring for therapies that impact immune response that the wellshield™ technology is designed to detect and interpret differential metabolic responses that wellshield could help reduce the majority of the false positive results and that the potential market for liquid biopsies is  billion in the usa alone and that we have patent protection on our technology  actual events or results may differ materially from those projected in any of such statements due to various factors including the risks and uncertainties inherent in drug and treatment discovery and development which include without limitation the potential failure of development candidates to advance through

requirements for new medical procedures good results in small trials and among limited cases does not necessarily lead to the same good results for large numbers or in the general public  competitors

property of others we may not be able to commercialize our product and even if we do we may not realize any profit the potential market may be much smaller than expected readers are cautioned not to

support investment insights january  the future is now disruptive technology trends in  as innovation continues to create new markets and challenge existing industries capital group investment professionals share their insights on how disruptive technology can benefit investors in  predictions many questioned from the movie “back to the future” came true in  as the cubs won the world series and nike began to offer selflacing sneakers whether or not nike’s power laces gain mainstream acceptance the way we live and work is being enhanced by dramatic changes in technology disruptive technologies are the result of new business models that are constantly innovating often their initial products or services appeal to only a small audience of customers however if they can evolve to offer higher quality at lower prices they cause disruption by creating new markets and challenging existing industries “as investors we need to understand not only the opportunities but also the threats to incumbents” notes nick grace a capital group portfolio manager cloud computing is accelerating disruptive technologies cloud computing has been a hugely disruptive force over the past decade driving innovation and in turn enabling new business models many people have a hazy understanding of “the cloud” and whether it will keep their data secure but most are already relying on cloud computing services when they use email online banking and social media in reality the cloud is a global network of massive facilities filled with hardware that runs software to store manage and process data remotely cloud providers such as amazon microsoft and google now rent computing services over the internet in fact amazon’s cloudcomputing platform amazon web services aws is the fastestgrowing business in the history of technology services aws grew its revenue from  million in  to nearly  billion in five years the cloud’s potential is skyhigh amazon web services is the fastestgrowing business in the history of enterprise information technology sources capital group and sec us securities and exchange commission reported company financial filings data are estimates this innovation has allowed large companies to reduce or eliminate the cost of maintaining their own data centers cloud providers also benefit startups by reducing their need to buy technology so they can focus on product development cloudcomputing businesses will continue to have strong investment potential particularly when they are able to dispel remaining security concerns by demonstrating they offer higher standards at lower costs than corporate departments “i think people are likely to be surprised by the accelerated rate at which information technology it needs move to the cloud over the next three years” says capital group portfolio manager mark casey in addition to helping launch new businesses and changing existing practices the cloud is disrupting companies that sell computer hardware and software by sharing resources in the cloud companies no longer need to own computing power that may sit idle or quickly become obsolete machine learning is creating cures cloud computing is increasingly enabling computers to teach themselves by analyzing massive amounts of data from the web smartphones and other internetconnected devices common “machine learning” applications include those that train computers to understand speech and recognize images smartphone virtual assistants now respond to questions and social media can tag names to photos advances in machine learning are having a profound impact on the medical world as well an example is a smartphone app that can detect skin cancer three years ago the technology was  accurate today the app is even more precise — roughly equal to the diagnostic skills of a dermatologist gene sequencing perhaps provides an even greater example it took  years and  billion to sequence the first human genome now the cost of sequencing dna is  and can be done in a few days soon it will cost as little as  and take just one day doctors may then be able to diagnose an illness by comparing a patient’s dna to databases that have already identified factors that contribute to the disease machine learning is also supporting the data analysis that has been integral in the development of new drugs these treatments can be personalized to target the specific nature of a patient’s illness based on their dna “these advances allow us to imagine curing diseases not just treating them” says capital group investment analyst rich wolf many pharmaceutical companies are now spending more money on developing therapies benefiting equipment suppliers with the technology to do the necessary research however drug companies that underinvest in disruptive innovation may need to acquire competitors with a stronger pipeline of potential treatments selfdriving cars hit the road going mobile used to mean going on the road not
