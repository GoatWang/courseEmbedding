paper global key points current economic trends us commercial real estate fundamentals and factors specific to the cmbs market are conducive to positive longterm cmbs performance strong excess spread relative to alternatives attractive riskadjusted return trends and portfolio diversification benefits are some of the main reasons investors should  consider adding cmbs exposure cmbs has a place in both real estate and fixed income portfolios offering diversified efficient and liquid  exposure to commercial real estate debt via publicly traded securities introduction commercial mortgagebacked securities “cmbs” represents a prominent segment of the us commercial real estate investment landscape carrying an outstanding balance of over   billion  principal real estate investors believes current economic trends us commercial real estate fundamentals and factors specific to the cmbs market are conducive to positive longterm cmbs performance moreover strong excess spread  relative to alternatives attractive riskadjusted return trends and portfolio diversification benefits are some of the main reasons investors should consider adding cmbs exposure within the context of broader fixed  income andor real estate portfolios the majority of the cmbs market consists of fixedrate bonds collateralized by diversified pools of first mortgages on commercial real estate properties located throughout the us a simple  bond structure is used to create individual bond classes called tranches which each carry  a distinct rating and riskreturn profile please see our “cmbs faq” at wwwprincipalglobalcom for answers  to common investor questions since cmbs has attributes of both the commercial real estate and fixed  income asset classes cmbs has a home  in both real estate and fixed  income portfolios offering diversified efficient and liquid exposure to commercial real estate debt via publicly traded securities economic and space market fundamentals the performance of us commercial real estate including cmbs is driven in large part by the health of the labor market indeed  was a strong year for job growth as total employment surpassed the prerecession peak in april and full year payrolls rose by over  million nearly  per month with unemployment levels dropping low interest rates persisting and inflationary pressures remaining manageable consumer spending ended the year on a high note up  in the fourth quarter us commercial real estate is benefitting from these trends in the form of generally positive rent growth and declining vacancy rates resulting in yearoveryear increases in net operating income noi as seen in exhibit  this trend is supported by historically low levels of new construction exhibit  allowing landlords to benefit from attractive supplydemand dynamics in most us real estate markets these factors have culminated in rising real estate values with prices exceeding prior peak levels in major markets although nonmajor markets have yet to fully recover exhibit    property type outlook each property type is impacted by “distinct storylines” creating diversification benefits within each cmbs investment please see principal global investor’s “inside real estate annual strategy outlook for ”  for further information notably the collateral for each cmbs issuance is welldiversified across geography and property type office approaching an upside inflection point with demand occupancy and rent growth poised to accelerate improving job market spurs on demand especially for more modern and efficient space industrial secular change  drives strong performance as increasing global trade a resurgence in us manufacturing and the rapid expansion of ecommerce lift demand for industrialwarehouse space multifamily unprecedented demand results in low vacancy strong rent growth and new supply nearterm deceleration in revenue growth should be tempered long term as secular trends favor multifamily over singlefamily retail high correlation to us economy and consumer spending sluggish wage growth has been a headwind however discount stores and luxury retailers wealth effect have performed well lodging strong revpar revenue per available room growth driven by economic recovery and increased personalbusiness travel new supply on the horizon and slowing global demand bear watching cmbs market landscape five years of us economic growth supportive supplydemand dynamics in the real estate space markets and fully functional capital markets are generating a solid fundamental landscape for cmbs the  day delinquency rate has fallen to the lowest level since early  as new defaults approach  levels and loan resolutions progress notably the  day delinquency rate for the  vintages is extremely low ranging from  looking out over the next two to three  years year mortgages originated between  and  will reach maturity and require refinancing a significant event  for the cmbs market given  the size of this refinance wave and the aggressiveness with which many of these loans were underwritten the previously discussed growth in property nois and valuations is beneficial to refinancing prospects through improved debt service  coverage ratios dscr and loantovalue ltv metrics additionally the cmbs newissuance market has demonstrated strong yearover year growth providing an important source  of first mortgage capital for future cmbs refinancing needs there is also a significant amount of subordinate debt capital available in the capital markets helping to fill the gap between elevated maturing loan balances and more  conservative firstmortgage sizing offered by core mortgage lenders these dynamics have already resulted in the payoff rate for maturing loans increasing from  as of q  to over  as of q  when including loans paid off within three  months of original maturity additionally the size of the refinance wave is declining as borrowers prepay loans early to take advantage of the current low rate environment note cmbs loans contain strong callprotection and borrowers are only able to prepay via defeasance or yield  maintenance as discussed later this is helping to moderate the potential impact of the refinance wave as nearly   billion of future maturities have prepaid over the past two years exhibit   cmbs a changing landscape and terminology since the global financial crisis there  have been several  changes in the cmbs market which have required a change  in terminology for instance bonds issued prior to  are referred to as “legacy cmbs” while those  issued in  and beyond are generally referred to as “cmbs ” the advent of cmbs  has been accompanied by a return to relatively more  disciplined cashflow underwriting more conservative credit rating agency assumptions and a simpler bond structure these changes have created positive effects for cmbs investors when  compared with  vintages cmbs  loan collateral displays lower average ltvs and higher average dscrs exhibit   importantly cmbs  also offers significantly higher subordination levels across the cmbs bond structure exhibit   while  cmbs  offers a relatively more  secure credit profile than legacy cmbs loan originators are becoming more aggressive as competitive pressures mount in the lending market this competition has mainly been reflected in higher ltv ratios  although loanlevel leverage is increasing we have not seen the quality of underwritten cash flows deteriorate materially ie limited “pro forma underwriting” which is a positive trend compared to underwriting in  and  additionally the credit rating agencies are increasing subordination levels in response to higher loan level ltvs in an attempt to offset riskier  collateral with stronger structural credit enhancements exhibit   finally investors are demanding higher spreads  for deals that are perceived to be riskier this activity can be seen in exhibit  which shows that more  recent vintages with higher leverage levels are carrying higher market credit spreads importantly cmbs is a nonhomogenous product and careful security selection based on an understanding of each issuance’s unique pool  of underlying mortgage collateral is critical cmbs relative value in addition to positive market fundamentals cmbs  currently offers attractive relative value versus corporate bonds and private commercial mortgages of similar  duration over the past year cmbs  aa  bonds have averaged  basis points in excess spread  and cmbs  bbb bonds have averaged  basis points in excess spread  vs comparably rated corporate bonds exhibit   notably cmbs exhibits comparable liquidity to corporate bonds and offers a wide  range of duration and credit exposures providing a flexible fixedincome investment alternative in addition to excess spread  and flexibility cmbs provides strong call protection which differentiates it from residential mortgagebacked securities call protection in cmbs typically moves  through three  consecutive forms over  the typical year loan term thus providing a lockout period usually the first two years a period allowing prepayment via defeasance replacement of the cashflow stream with government securities or yield maintenance a prepayment penalty to help  the cmbs trust recoup the loss of future cash flows for the bulk of the loan’s  term a final three to sixmonth openatpar period ie freely prepayable as compared to private mortgages cmbs provides diversified real estate debt exposure in a liquid investment vehicle  each unique cmbs  issuance  is secured by between  to over   mortgages on properties located across the us accordingly cmbs is well diversified by property type  geography borrower and tenancy for investors familiar with private mortgages cmbs loan collateral includes a diversified mix of property types markets property qualities and leverage levels some of which would be considered “core” and some of which would be considered “noncore” from an institutional lender  perspective however cmbs overlays the pool of mortgages with varying levels of subordination ie credit enhancement to provide a discrete riskreturn spectrum at the bond level with these differences in mind  cmbs and private mortgages complement one another with cmbs offering liquidity and excess spread  to comparable mortgages exhibit   notably this excess spread  is greater further out  on the risk spectrum versus both mortgages and corporate bonds  as cmbs investors receive greater compensation for incremental risk for rolling down the credit curve cmbs liquidity and volatility since the global financial crisis cmbs remains  an active market that affords an individual account the ability to transact  million or more  in a single day without materially moving the market at bidask spreads  comparable to competing fixed  income sectors over the past year average weekly trading volume has averaged approximately  billion resulting in an approximate annual market turnover ratio of over   postcrisis dealer  balance sheets are smaller  and more  highly regulated across the fixed  income industry and dealers  are transitioning from true market makers  to market facilitators that line up buyers and sellers alongside their  downsized ability to take positions on balance sheet while  there  are some common misperceptions about a lack of liquidity in the sector in reality cmbs trades in a very active market in fact the ability to trade was one of the factors contributing to the volatility cmbs experienced during the height of the global financial crisis as other asset classes were going “no bid” cmbs dealers  continued to put out bidside levels because of this accounts were able to sell cmbs during the height of the crisis which exacerbated the relative spread  widening versus other fixed  income sectors like almost any asset class liquidity in the cmbs market can be driven by technical factors unrelated to market fundamentals or can change  during periods of macromarket volatility however volatility can offer opportunity in addition to risk if these dynamics are closely monitored over the post global financial crisis time  period volatility of investmentgrade cmbs fell measurably as buyers began  to recognize value and demand for cmbs resurfaced in fact the trailing month standard deviation of the barclays investment grade cmbs index crossed below that of the barclays us corporate investment grade index in late  and has remained there  since in the higheryielding cmbs  space this phenomenon is displayed in the dramatic reduction in average spreads  and annual spread volatility of bbb rated bonds in exhibit  absent a significant macro shock we would expect this dynamic to persist as more  investors have entered the cmbs market and existing players have expanded their  credit thresholds in summary excess spread  paired with market liquidity and a downward trend in spread  volatility all contribute to the potential attractiveness of cmbs versus comparable investment alternatives cmbs investment opportunities another benefit of the cmbs asset class is that it offers the potential for portfolio diversification having exhibited historical correlations well below  vs a variety of asset classes exhibit   barclays aggregatebased fixed income investors may find value in overweighting the sector given  the previously discussed excess spread  provided versus corporate bonds cmbs currently comprises  of the barclays us aggregate index additionally a wide range of cmbs investment strategies are available offering yields  of     in the cmbs  investment grade space comparing favorably to the yield  of the cmbs component of the barclays us aggregate which yielded  as of  january  for investors with existing commercial real estate exposure cmbs can provide an attractive compliment to equity reits and private mortgages a public real estate strategy pairing cmbs with reits offers an alternative riskreturn option versus a standalone reit exposure by introducing a more  conservative blended risk profile with potentially higher current income in a tradeoff for reduced equity upside  potential for private mortgage investors a complimentary cmbs allocation can provide efficient and diversified real estate debt exposure in a liquid and flexible investment that currently offers excess spread  and superior regulatory capital efficiency investment options we believe the following nonexhaustive list of cmbs investment options presents attractive riskadjusted return opportunities at a variety of points along  the riskreturn and duration spectrums these options should be taken within the context of overall investment objectives including risk tolerance return targets and potential asset liability matching considerations high qualityshort duration legacy ams – issued as aaarated year bonds with  subordination in  many bonds carry  a national association of

yields shorter duration profiles and a unique risk profile which helps diversify a broader cmbs portfolio conclusion the cmbs market has been benefiting from the tailwinds of a growing us economy

to enhance  the attractiveness of the sector each property type including office industrial retail  multifamily and lodging is impacted by “distinct storylines” creating diversification benefits
