atalla vice president of sustainability initiatives at kb home at the company’s model home in its promenade development on communications hill in san jose by troy wolverton  published november   at  am  updated february   at  amsan jose — silicon valley home buyers who want not only a new place but a smart one can now get a house that’s preconfigured to be controlled by their apple devices kb home on friday announced that it’s offering a package of home automation features designed to be controlled by iphones and ipads as an option on houses in two of its new neighborhoods one in san jose and the other in fremont the move marks the first time nationwide the home builder has offered buyers such an option jacob atalla vice president of sustainability initiatives at kb compared the home industry to the car business in recent years the number of advanced technological features included in cars — from large touchscreen displays to automatic braking — has rapidly increased consumers are starting to expect such advanced technological features in all the products they buy atalla said “we are focused on innovation” he said “it’s important to people’s lifestyles” the basic option package which will cost around  includes an automatic door lock a smart thermostat and lights and a fan that can be remote controlled users can add other devices to the system either when they design their homes or after moving in the package will also come with an ipad to control the home automation system inside the house and an apple tv that will allow homeowners to interact with their smart home devices remotely kb will offer complimentary concierge service to help homeowners set up their systems atalla views the “scenes” he can use inside apple’s home app to control the various smart home devices inside the model home in the company’s promenade development on communications hill troy wolvertonmercury news homeowners will interact with the smart home devices using the home app a new feature built into ios  the latest version of the operating system underlying iphones and ipads the home app not only allows users to control individual devices — dimming a particular light bulb or closing an automatic shade partway — it allows users to create “scenes” that can control multiple devices at once the home app also enables users to control their smart home devices using siri apple’s voice controlled intelligent assistant that’s built into ios for example if a homeowner told siri “i’m home” it might turn on the lights in the living room open the shades and turn on the air conditioner all at once kb has been offering home automation products as an option in its houses for about  years atalla said but it wasn’t an ideal situation because homeowners typically had to use a different app for each one of the different smart home products in their houses what makes apple’s home app and homekit environment exciting to kb home is that it allows consumers to access all those devices in one place and interact with many at one time he said “this is what we were waiting for” he said an apple representative declined to comment in some respects what kb home’s doing makes sense said jonathan gaw a research manager who focuses on the consumer internet of things market for tech consulting firm idc it’s much easier and more efficient to have some smart home products like light switches installed by a home builder when a house is constructed he said also rolling the costs for those products into the home mortgage allows home buyers to more easily afford them upfront — and helps builders sell a higher priced home but the way kb home is rolling this out looks a bit gimmicky gaw said home automation — at least for the mass market — is still a nascent industry it’s not clear yet exactly what products consumers will really want or use or even what smart home product companies will be around in five or ten years he said customers may find in six months or a couple years that they don’t use the products they have or that they’re defunct or no longer supported “there have already been instances of this” gaw noted where consumers have bought a particular smart home product and then the company goes out of business instead of a cool home automation product he added “you have a doorstop or a paperweight” given that it would make a lot more sense for consumers if kb home were offering its smart home options as an ongoing service which offered ongoing support to customers and could allow them to easily change out outdated products gaw said “i’m skeptical of approaches to internet of things solutions that look at these things as devices or product and not as services or solutions” he said kb is offering a service element with its smart home option in the form of the concierge service included with its homeenabled home automation packages will be two hours of support that’s intended to help customers set up their systems and learn how to add additional devices or create new scenes in the future but it’s unclear the degree to which kb will help customers install or configure new products in the future many of the smart home products kb is offering as part of its options package are compatible with other home automation systems and devices like android smartphones and amazon’s echo smart speaker atalla said but for now kb is only offering to customize the smart home features for apple devices kb will be offering the packages as options in its promenade at communications hill development in san jose and its magnolia at patterson ranch neighborhood in fremont the company has set up a model home in its san jose development to showcase the smart home features sign up for our newsletters subscribe follow us facebook twitter instagram

its customers at an affordable price kb home has been named the no  green homebuilder in a study by calvert investments and the no  homebuilder on fortune magazine’s  world’s most admired companies list objectives with a focus on continually improving its homes kb home sought a way to take its new built to order homes to the next level because of the company’s commitment to building energy star® qualified homes it wanted to add a feature that would play an integral role in meeting energy star criteria and provide its customers with significant energy savings implementation kb home found the solution among a host of upgrades it had been offering its customers lp® techshield® radiant barrier sheathing after seven years of providing lp techshield sheathing as an upgrade option to homeowners kb home decided to make the product a standard feature on all of its homes at no added cost to its customers “initially we started using techshield as an upgrade option to increase the energy efficiency of the homes” said jacob atalla senior director of sustainability for kb home “as energy efficiency codes and construction codes have become more stringent and as kb home has continued to grow our commitment to building more energyefficient homes shifting from using techshield as an option to installing it as a standard feature became a nobrainer” constructed with a thin durable sheet of laminated aluminum to lp® osb sheathing lp techshield radiant barrier sheathing builds energy efficiency directly into the home the radiant barrier helps block up to  percent of radiant heat in the roof sheathing from entering the attic reducing the heat load on the air handling system “features like techshield open the door to further educate homebuyers on the availability of building materials with environmental benefits and longterm cost savings for them personally” said dan bridleman senior vice president of sustainability for kb home “ in today’s market consumers want to understand the impact on the environment but also need to see the cost benefit to their pocketbooks” because lp techshield radiant barrier sheathing can lower attic temperatures by as much as  degrees the product can help homeowners save up to  percent on monthly cooling costs “techshield offers kb home more than energy savings for our customers” atalla explained “it’s easy to install with no longterm maintenance and it represents the quality we’ve come to trust from lp building products” lp techshield radiant barrier sheathing installs like conventional roof sheathing requiring no additional labor and with the patented vaporventstm technology it dries more quickly from construction moisture than other radiant barriers outcome kb home is the first national builder to make lp techshield radiant barrier sheathing a standard feature in all of its new homes because it is energy star certified and uses sfi certified forest management and wood procurement systems the product has helped kb home maintain its commitment to sustainability “this product works beautifully in delivering efficiency and it has excellent marketing and customer service support behind it the relationship we have with

review share on facebookshare on twittershare on google plusemailsariah of santa clarita cajune  verified reviewerverified buyersatisfaction ratingdo not buy a kb home  nine months ago my husband and i purchased a brand new kb home in santa clarita to achieve our dream and give our children the family home we always wanted ourselves we saved all that we could took out from our k and literally invested everything we had into purchasing this kb home but its been nothing but a nightmare we have written multiple emails to customer service division president and even the ceo of kb and they simply reply back that its within industry standards and just evading our requests our home was built with no care as we moved to santa clarita from corona which is a  hr drive one way we were not lucky enough to see our home being built we had trusted kb in building our home correctly and safelyfor the past nine months we have had submitted over  claims in defects of this newly built kb home they have only fixed about  of those claims and some of the fixed claims created more damage and more claims to be open we have even hired a third party inspector to check the structure of our home as i will attach the report with this letter some of the things that were found were absolutely ridiculous i will mention just a fewour attic isnt even attached correctly the metal plates arent even attached they forgot to attach caps on our roof which may have cause wood rot because of all the rain this past year there are more than  broken tiles on our roof the brick wall caps are not even cemented down and come right off there is a  point checklist and that was not finished and signed missing wood beams on our stairs the carpet was not installed correctly every corner is not stapled to the ground and can be lifted out we found nails screws staples and a  inch razor blade that my year old son found and started to play with just last week i found over  birds living under our roof tiles because they didnt close off the corners of our roof our flooring downstairs has bubbling throughout the house our air conditioning unit had missing screws and its not even leveledthese problems should not be problems at all for a brand new home obviously there was no quality control and their inspector did nothing but pass and sign the inspection reports as some of the checkpoints were not even signed off which is why there is so much debris under our floors i am writing this because it has brought so much stress on me and my family they treat us with no respect and express that our claims are a joke even to fix one claim they come look at it and tell us to be home on a certain day from pm and a vendor will show up and fix that one claim i would have to stay home ask someone to pick up my daughter from st grade and later without a phone call they werent able to make it out because the vendor is still working on another home another time our flooring wasnt flushed to the kitchen island and kb sent a man to repair it it took him  hours to cover the mistake they did not even fix the problem but simply just put a mold to cover their mistake and told me again that it was industry standardsfive years ago i was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis after the birth of my son my body seemed to have been overstressed and i was unable to walk with lots of testings and dr visits we found the cause and treated it right away i have been stable and healthy with the infusion i get monthly that helps with my overactive immune system i havent had any flare ups however with all the stress kb has given me my body seems to slowly be dying i had a seizure five months ago in our new kb home landed right on my face in the back yard and broke three of my front teeth i was hospitalized for  days and just last month i was diagnosed with lupus and celiac disease my body has exponentially deteriorated i am a mother of two and weigh only  pounds i now see a therapist two times a week to alleviate my stress my rheumatologist said that all the stress from kb is exasperating my immune system and more diseases are arising the infusion i took for years is no longer working and creating antigens i now take anti anxiety medicine  times a day from all this my husband and i pleaded and repeatedly asked them to help us fix all the mistakes we have three months left until our year warranty expires and hardly anything got fixed im terrified for my childrens safety this home and my body shutting downone day i was so terrified that i went to the division presidents office pleadingcrying to help us out he didnt even let me enter his office and kicked me out he said i have no time for you he told me to leave and never come back i drove back home crying and devastated in

experience came out to be like this we didnt always have questions when we meet up with the sale staff and when we do he didnt always have the answer there was many times he had to get back to us when we met with the construction staff we learned a lot about the house and regret a lot about certain upgrades because the sale staff didnt tell us about certain things seems like he was more about making a sale but the construction staff was great scott he told us about everything even things we didnt think of so he was great another thing was the loan officer she was hard to get to when we had questions it was really hard for my husband because he didnt want me to sign anything before meeting in person asked our questions and clarify certain parts of the document because this is something very big for us and we wanted to get it right the first time and understand what we are signing for so because reaching out to her was very hard it made this process hard for us we sign documents and wait until theres more things for us to sign we just thought the loan process would have been a lot different where we are all on the same page on everything as to everything in life there are the ups
