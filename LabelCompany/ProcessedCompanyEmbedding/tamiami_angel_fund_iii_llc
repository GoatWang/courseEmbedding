press contact us fund chairman fund administrator press for angels for angels upstart entrepreneurs increasingly dominate the nation’s economy the life cycle of many new products has become so short that a business can only succeed by reducing its product development phase and accelerating its presence in the global marketplace in slower times a business could grow incrementally from region to region usually from internally generated capital nowadays the demands for rapid growth require outside capital which banks typically are not able to provide as the institutional venture capital industry continues to focus on later stage and larger investments the private investor market now provides the major source of seed and startup capital however private investor seed and early stage venture investing is still a relatively young phenomenon the vast majority of small businesses—more than —are lifestyle businesses they tend to have lowpaying jobs with few benefits the most important small businesses—in terms of economic development—are rapidgrowth smes small to medium sized enterprises or “gazelles” which make up only  of all small businesses but account for  of net new jobs “gazelles” as mit economist david burch calls them have survived their earliest stages and are rapidly expanding firms typically venture capital is not readily available in the smaller amounts that might be appropriate for a very young or early stage company therefore venture capitalists leave a funding gap the gap exists as to time – during the earliest stages of a startups life which lasts at least a year – and as to capital – for amounts under  million angel investors defined by the us securities exchange commission as accredited investors are commonly identified as those sophisticated enough to fill the funding gaps jeffrey sohl from the center for venture research cvr at the university of new hampshire estimates that angel investors provide  of the seed and early stage capital to startups therefore angels fill the time gap by investing when venture capitalist will not it is because of this difference in the timing of capital infusion angels invest in the earliest stages of development that make angel investing complementary to venture capital investment an angel investor or “angel” known as a business angel in europe is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business startup the origin of term angel investor can be traced to the beginning of the era of broadway productions in new york city where individual investors provided the muchneeded capital to finance struggling theatre productions requiring a bit more funding it defined those individuals who would fight against all odds to put up the high risk and early stage money to launch broadway shows as a result those who invested were considered “angels” the concept migrated west to hollywood in connection with the movie industry and ultimately spread north to silicon valley where the term has been associated with the seed stage financing rounds of earlystage emerginggrowth technology companies today the term still identifies those individuals that take risks and invests his or her own money in an entrepreneurial company this concept differentiates angel investors from early stage later stage or any stage venture capitalists who invest other people’s money copyright   peninsula fund

is currently testing its proprietary reactor technology designed to improve efficiency in the production of hydrogen and syngas by the steam methane reforming process “we are very pleased to have a fund like t decide to make a major investment in our company and we treat that as a real compliment to our business plan and what we’ve accomplished to date” said bruce boisture ceo of zoneflow “t’s investment will fund continued product development and testing” said gerald lippes a member of t’s due diligence team lippes said the team was impressed by zoneflow’s professional management its knowledge of the industry and its use of financing “the company is in the manufacturing business which gives us an interesting diversity for our fund” said timothy cartwright chairman of t “most of our fund is invested in hightech” zoneflow’s progress was another factor with the company expecting to introduce its technology in the next few years “from the outset we’ve been involved very heavily with engineering production and catalyst companies in our industry as we’ve developed our product” said boisture “we have also focused entirely on validation programs that range from joint development of specific product applications to pilot plant testing the funding from t in addition to the capital raise will allow us to pursue and execute the validation programs the first of which commenced this month we also executed the first round of preliminary tests on a separate major testing program that began a year ago” “the company is pretty far along with what it wants to achieve” lippes said “zoneflow is starting to test the technology and that’s why we invested it’s a different product than what’s currently available in the marketplace so its success also depends on the response from the industry” the potential gamechanging technology has farreaching applications in a large market including crude oil refining making ammonia for fertilizer producing methanol and reducing iron ore to
