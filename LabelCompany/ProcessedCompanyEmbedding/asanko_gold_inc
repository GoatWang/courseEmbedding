was successfulasankos management denied the accusations of muddy waters llc regarding the operational issues and additional cash needsafter the esaase deposit is in full production asanko gold should produce approximately  toz gold per year at an aisc of toz according to the dfsthere is a chance that the expansion of the current operations will be financed from internal sourcesthe current market value of the company is  million which doesnt reflect the true potential asanko goldfor asanko gold nysemktakg the last  days were really hectic on may  muddy waters llc released a negative report on asanko gold among other claims muddy waters stated that asanko gold has a huge problem with the collapse of the western wall of its nkran pit and as a result it will have to invest  million to keep nkran in production muddy waters also stated that asanko doesnt have enough money to keep nkran in production and it is about to go bankrupt although asanko has provided information about the collapse several weeks ago and it has also stated that the collapse had no major impacts on its operations some of asankos investors got scared by muddy waters report and asankos share price collapsed to  before the trading was halted akg data by ycharts muddy waters is another short seller that tried to push asankos share price down the previous attempts were made by k that attacked asankos resource estimates some of the articles were published also here on seeking alpha     asanko responded in the best way possible and it released an updated resource estimate prepared using a more conservative methodology that resulted into only a slightly lower resource and reserve estimate although the attempts of k didnt cause too much damage muddy waters was able to push asankos share price down by more than  in less than one hour although asanko made a press release where it denied all of the speculations the share price has recovered only partially as shown by the chart above asankos share price is down by almost  yeartodate at the same time the short interest is up by more than  the short interest grew from less than  million shares in early january to the current level of  million shares in early  the short interest was way below the  million shares level it started to grow rapidly in june which coincides with the first of the abovementioned k articles the current short interest equals to  of asankos outstanding shares given that approximately  of shares are owned by insiders and institutional investors the extent of the short interest is pretty big but the shortsellers can afford to be that aggressive as they rely on the vaneck vectors junior gold miners etf nysearcagdxj portfolio rebalancing the rebalancing will weigh on the share prices of the junior miners which should enable the short sellers to close their positions relatively comfortably this is most probably also the reason why asankos share price hasnt fully recovered yet although the results of the esaase feasibility study and the updated mine plan indicate that asanko is doing well and muddy waters speculations were wrong also on the th page of its newest corporate presentation asanko gold clearly states that the western wall failure hasnt impacted ore production and safety an independent consultant srk recommended to change the design of the pit in the failure area from  to  degrees which means that additional  million tonnes of waste must be mined as a result the lifeofmine nkran pit strip ratio should grow from  to  or by  removing  million tonnes of waste definitely wont cost  million as speculated by muddy waters the feasibility study the recently released results of the definitive feasibility study show that the asanko mine expansion is economically viable moreover there is a good probability that the company will be able to finance it from internal sources the study includes two development stages project  million and project  million the project m consists of upgrading of the current processing plant to  million tonnes per annum capacity construction of a conveyor belt to the esaase deposit and development of the esaase deposit the project m capex is estimated at  million after the project m is completed the asanko mine should be able to produce  toz gold at an aisc of toz over a year mine life at a gold price of  the aftertax npv is  million the leverage to the gold price is really high as gold price growth by  adds almost  million to the npv construction of the project m is underway the expansion of the processing facility should be completed by q  also the preparation of the conveyor belt construction is underway it is fully permitted and the bush clearing for the conveyor should be almost finished now according to the may  news release the conveyor belt as well as the esaase deposit development should be completed in  the project m is another stage of expansion it consists of increasing the processing plant capacity from  million to  million tonnes per annum and some additional investments into the esaase deposit development the project  m capex is estimated at  million after the project m is completed asanko should be able to produce approximately  toz gold per year at an aisc of toz the mine life should be approximately  years long at a gold price of toz the aftertax npv of the project m is  million gold price growth by  boosts the npv by  million the date of the project m completion is yet unknown although some of the calculations presented by the dfs assumed that it could be completed by  asankos management intends to make the construction decision based on the market situation s project  million is a modular expansion asanko has complete flexibility on its timing a construction decision will be at the boards discretion and will be dependent on both the successful commissioning and rampup of project  million an optimized balance sheet as well as positive market conditions the main difference between the m and m projects is the speed of production over the lifeofmine the same amount of gold should be produced in both of the scenarios but in the case of m the gold should be produced much quicker which leads also to higher npv and slightly lower aisc source own processing using data of asanko gold can asanko gold do it without share dilution yes it can as of the end of q asanko gold held cash  cash equivalents worth  million the management expects that the company will be able to generate cash of another  million by the end of  it means that asanko gold should have cash of around  million at the end of this year if the current gold price prevails the company should be able to generate operating cash flow of more than  million in  source own processing using data of asanko gold if asanko decides to follow the timetable projected by the dfs it should invest  million into m in   million in  and  million in  the investments into m should equal to  million in   million in  and  million in  according to this schedule the situation should be the most critical in  when the combined m  m capex expenditures should equal  million however if the average realized gold price doesnt decline below  and if actual aisc and production volumes are not worse than projected there is a good probability that asanko gold will be able to finance the whole expansion without further share dilution the problem is only asankos debt facility back in  red kite lent  million to asanko gold the loan bears an interest rate of libor the repayments will start on july   on a quarterly basis and the whole debt should be repaid by july   during this period asanko will have to repay approximately  million every quarter it means that if asanko doesnt manage to refinance the red kite credit facility it will have to postpone the project m to  or  conclusion the dfs confirms that the esaase deposit is economical moreover the costs related with the west wall collapse at the nkran pit will be much smaller than predicted by muddy waters although the estimated project m capex is higher compared to the pfs the project is still very attractive with an aftertax npv  of  million at a gold price of  after the expansion of the asanko mine is fully completed asanko gold should produce around  toz gold per year at an aisc of less than toz although asanko operates in africa which means that the market will apply lower multipliers to its share price a profitable midtier gold producer should be worth more than  billion not the current  million the recent bear attack

canada on the morning of may  before reboundingmuddy waters released a page report that detailed why the stock was worth zero the main reason is the high grading of the mine with fatal consequences for itk a canadian hedge fund is also very negative and is profitably shorting asanko since june last year the evidence brought forward includes an analysis of satellite images and gradethe west side of the main pit is already collapsing and costs to go back to the original plan are expected to be more than m and are not budgetedthe arguments are compelling and the company will answer next week this story is a great lesson for all mining investors shares of asanko gold inc nysemktakg tumbled  in toronto and  in new york on wednesday the st of may  before rebounding on thursday this happened after californiabased hedge fund muddy waters released a negative report about the company the report stated that muddy waters was shorting the stock due to high grading at the main mine pit and ore reconciliation problems at the miners ghana operations coupled with a significant risk of a liquidity crisis in  muddy waters is a known short seller specialized in accounting fraud and due diligence of traded companies in the  page report muddy waters said that it expects asanko to run out of cash in  as it tries to service a m debt asanko ceo peter breese rebuffed all concerns in a statement shortly following the release of the report the asanko gold mine is a robust business he stated while reiterating the companys previous forecast that it would produce  to  ounces of gold this year they expect this to generate between m and m in cash assuming a  an ounce gold price according to the press statement the company will meet with its major shareholders on pentecost monday june  for a previously organized twoweek tour to discuss growth plans the meetings will include updates on two projects which asanko forecasts will boost annual production in ghana to  oz in  from the current  this short article comprises three parts firstly we will briefly assess asankos business and assets after this we will discuss what muddy waters and fellow seeking alpha contributor k have to say about asanko which should explain why the valuation is plummeting lastly we will provide data showing that asanko might also be a victim of the gdxj nysearcagdxj fund rebalancing debacle that also had dramatic effects on other stocks note that this is not a formal trade recommendation and that the article only serves to inform the reader and to provide useful links to start a due diligence asanko gold asanko is a developmentstage gold miner that began commercial operations at its asanko gold mine in april  in  it is expecting an estimated production of  to  oz au all operations are in western ghana and the business plan stated that there will be a sequence of pits that will be mined starting with the nkran pit see below a conveyor belt is planned between the major esaase pit and the processing facilities near the nkran pit company website the company sports a  for open pits  relatively high grade portfolio of pits after some ma in the last  years the nkran pit is the one currently in production and is also the one creating the troubles previously referenced to total mineral resource estimate company website nb in the notes it is stated that cutoff is gt within a  oz au pit shell short seller  hedge fund muddy waters muddy waters trading outlook is that the companys shares will drop to zero the fund notes that asankos liquidity was limited to m of cash on hand with no availability on its m revolver credit using companyfavorable assumptions they estimate that asanko will have a cash shortfall ranging from m to m in  muddy waters report can be freely accessed here below you can see the balance sheet of the company first quarter report for the period ending mar   for a complete version here when looking at the report muddy waters thesis can be synthesized in  main points basing themselves on flawed geology akg made investments in nkran esaase and other deposits that the fund believes will never be recovered muddy waters claims that the western nkran wall suffered a significant collapse something that seems to be confirmed by photographic evidence see further below muddy waters estimates that asanko needs to spend   m soon to push back and move the collapsed material as to avoid a mine pinch out this is a twoedged sword spending this kind of money would likely mean that akg will run out of liquidity in  whereas not spending the money leaves the company without the cash flow to develop its largest deposit later esaase asankos satellite deposits are unlikely to yield significant cash flow due to assumed flawed geology this was previously obscured due to the fact that in a december  upgrade to their resources akg used a record gold price  oz  to boost their estimated value this is clearly one of the most serious flaws as the gold price currently hovers around oz muddy waters believes to have found indications that some of akgs resource models have been smeared which would mean that estimates of their ore contents are inflated management is outwardly assured and confident but their behavior reeks of desperation and shorttermism note furthermore that the capital cost to build esaase is estimated at m this money has to be provided from cash flow while the company should essentially be lowering its long term debt before seeking refinancing next year asanko issued a mineral resource estimate in december  that reduced the gold in its nkran and esaase deposits by a value of m and was more in line with reality this estimate is still flawed however due to the already cited highly inflated gold price it is based on the original mine plan called to mine slowly and use the cash flow to develop the satellite deposits what happened however is that the mine is being mined steeply where there is a higher grade portion while deferring stripping because they are encountering lower grades in the halo around the higher grade core this is in fact sterilizing the rest of the mine as it is less and less economical to take care of the long term ability to follow the high grade zones at depth as the surface is not being stripped using the cash flow from operations at a point there will be nothing to mine left accessible from surface and it will be too dangerous to mine at the bottom of the pit this tradeoff happens at all open pit mines but should however not happen immediately after starting to mine moreover plans should be made to keep track of it and deal with this as it is a well known problem in this video interview at bnn carson block ceo of muddy waters specifically affirms that the managements scrambling for mining shallow nearby satellite deposits see previous map will not be sufficient to save the company after muddy waters let us now look at what the next short seller  and fellow seeking alpha contributor  k has to say about asanko as it is their belief that problems are even more systemic than outlined in the muddy waters report short seller  hedge fund k k and associates is a toronto based hedge fund that has shorted asanko since june  and is hence making a nice profit already it seems that the main reason for k to start shorting asanko was the fact that its gold resources were overinflated this applies specifically to its nkran deposit which asanko acquired from resolute mining ltd in  y asanko share price chart to my knowledge k was the first to issue a report asserting that the geology of nkran was not what was previously projected in the feasibility study here you can read the very compelling  page report the report and the arguments brought forward were reiterated in this article from last february here on seeking alpha the thesis is that asanko is already highgrading the mine in q  asanko appears to have mined ahead of schedule down the throat of the orebody by going deeper without moving the material around the ore waste rock it sterilizes future mining as it will be even less economical to move waste rock later if there is less left to extract k presentation k pointed out that in the feasibility study nkran is supposed to be mined at an average annual rate of only mtpa in   the company was supposed to strip the pit with one bigger shovel the large cat with mtpa of mining capacity and one smaller cat with mtpa of mining capacity for the mining of the gold bearing ore there is supposed to be a reduction of equipment in nkran but there are two of the big shovels working on site k presentation what we can notice from the satellite photos however and what was also referred by muddy waters is that not only are there two big shovels mining near the gold bearing structures there are also waste rock movements that are being delayed furthermore a part of the west wall has collapsed delayed development work and collapse on the west side in the yellow circle k report k believes that the company is being selective with its data releases and that it is in effect borrowing future income to pay for today this will eventually lead to a final crash when extraction of more gold will imply spending m dollars on stripping that was not done on time if all of this is indeed correct asanko is in a dire situation both short sellers believe that asanko is not being transparent with the mining production path they suspect that the company will not be able to refinance its debt in  while also financing the new deposits with cash flow and strip what was not stripped on time at the nkran pit gdxj and asanko as a complete different topic i want to signal here that on top of all company specific problems asanko is also caught up with the gdxj rebalancing debacle the etf gdxj has to sell shares  including of asanko  and this could also push share prices lower till the th of june when the rebalancing will be over there is also the possibility that asanko will be delisted from some indexes and hence have a smaller pool of potential investors gdxj impact on single stocks source macro tourist for all readers the real question is the following can asanko find m to refinance the long term debt due next year  find m to build the next pits including esaase  m to strip nkran if it is even worth at this point and at this gold price if you think it is possible then asanko is probably a buy at these prices if not then you could join the shorts in the article i have embedded all resources that you need in order start your due
