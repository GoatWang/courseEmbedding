addition to his wife rose of  years he is survived by his daughter jacqueline v lees and her husband paul lees of rowley three grandchildren olivia rose rachel anne and pj lees all of rowley and many nephews and nieces he was the brother of the late robert and edward voss jennie hunt and mary burgarella all formerly of west haven conn born april  9 in west haven conn son of the late jackion c and jennie triano voss don was also raised in that city attending and graduating high school there he began working with his father as a carpenter briefly and then joined the united brotherhood of carpenters union local  in 9 where he earned a life time member designation after  years he served as the treasurer of local  for many years don’s strong affiliation with the union bred his commitment to ensure he and his family bought american made products don served in as a seaman in the merchant marines in the early 9s he was proud of his service and often told his family stories of his time at sea many of which included how he stole into the kitchen at night to sneak ice cream from the cook’s locked freezer an offense worthy of court martial he often engaged in serious and dangerous work on the ship but made a point of telling the lightest of tales to his family an indication of his everpresent optimism in 9 he met rose once they decided to marry they began to build their home on voss road in west haven don’s father was a general contractor who wanted his children to live close and gave each child a lot of land don and rose built their house amidst don’s family the house he built was one of his proudest achievements even in the face of his work life as a master carpenter and millwright who built power plants hospitals and bridges don and rose raised their only child jackie in west haven while living in west haven don served as a member of the west haven planning and zoning commission and as the volunteer fire chief of the west haven fire department he still carried his badge in the car if he ever “got stopped” after he retired rose and don spent many years at nettles island florida where they enjoyed a robust social life there were many afternoons in those early years lingering with friends on the dock visiting and at the pool don joined the men’s club and fishing club at nettles island and often helped at the infamous fish fry on the grand canal in  rose and don moved from connecticut to rowley and built an inlaw apartment annexed to jackie and paul’s house in rowley they were an integral part of all aspects of jackie and paul’s life don was passionate about his family and instilled a strong family commitment don’s grandchildren were lucky to have lived with him their whole life and everyone looked forward to family dinners every night and a mean game of cards don was passionate about hunting history and reading he also took pride in what his family called his corny jokes and had a very dry sense of humor don could fix anything figure out how anything worked and was generous with his skill and effort he was gentle compassionate intuitive wise and patient his funeral will be held  am monday july  from the whittierporter funeral home  high street ipswich followed by the  am funeral mass of christian burial in st mary’s church  main st rowley family and friends are respectfully welcomed visiting hours will be sunday  pm to  pm memorial
