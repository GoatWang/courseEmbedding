value  meets expectations  i was asked to be the godmother of two children this year  and i thought it was a great idea to get each child a bible for their christening i love this bible and their parents loved it too i believe it is important for children to read books with characters that look like them in it it helps build self confidence and acceptance to be clear the actual text of the bible is short all of the stories arent accurate as another reviewer has stated but i believe that was done because it is meant to be the childs first bible theyre bible can be upgraded when they get a little older and have more understanding but for now i think the text is appropriate was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate abigail iola ks age over  gender female
