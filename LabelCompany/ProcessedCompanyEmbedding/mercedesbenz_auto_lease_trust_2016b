search now wwwaboutcomsuv lease home car services car rental deals car rental deals renting a car offers several unique advantages when compared to taking your own vehicle on a potentially distant journey first you will not place additional miles on your car a concern if it is still under warranty or if you are hoping to avoid additional wear and tear  most rental services provide truly stateoftheart choices from heated leather seats of gps technology and everything in between you will be truly enjoying the lap of luxury during your journey there is also a wide spectrum of vehicles to rent on a daily basis  whether you are travelling solo or you have to accommodate the needs of up to seven companions the chances are high that there is a vehicle suited for your discrete requirements lets look at some top tips and tricks to keep in mind during the rental process how to find the best deal you might already be aware that there are literally hundreds of different car rental firms throughout the united states much like any other business not all are created equally there are even some which you should avoid entirely to keep things simple we will now list a handful of questions that should be asked before committing to any type of contract these are what is the price of the rental car per day is any type of insurance covered within this price and if not can it be purchased separately what types of vehicles are offered is there a mileage limit during your rental agreement how can you contact customer service in the event of an emergency will you be required to fill up the tank with petrol before the vehicle is returned to the lot it is also wise to point out that the largest firms tend to provide the best service options some brand names to consider are hertz enterprise budget sixt and avis be sure to speak with a representative to make sure that any questions are thoroughly answered beforehand  view deals on car rental now choosing a vehicle the type of vehicle will depend upon several factors these include how many passengers will be travelling with you the expected weather conditions the distance needed to be travelled city driving versus crosscountry treks the range of cars can vary between miniature and compact cars to fullsized vans and sport utility vehicles for example a luxury sedan may be the best option if a small family is going on a trip over the weekend compact cars are better when navigating city traffic an suv or a van is ideal for those who may be attending a business seminar with a group of colleagues another obvious concern is the price luxury vehicles such as a cadillac will naturally cost more this should then be combined with the fuel efficiency of the unit in question compact cars tend to boast a higher mileage while large units such as sport utility vehicles can require a significant amount of petrol  this could very well eat into a limited budget booking in advance advanced booking is the best way to save a significant amount of money  most of the larger firms allow you to make a reservation online weeks in advance  not only is this more economical but the chances are high that you will be presented with a larger number of vehicles and “extras”  a final benefit here is that this type of reservation is often associated with additional discounts of between ten and fifteen per cent picking up and returning the car always ask the rules and regulations associated with picking up and dropping off the car  some companies will require you to fill up the tank of petrol in order to avoid additional surcharges  also ask if you are able to drop the car off at satellite locations or they instead require you to return it to the original rental destination  some firms ask that you clean the interior of the vehicle while others offer this as a complimentary service within the contract this is a comprehensive guide meant to streamline the entire car rental process  it is still advisable to speak with multiple providers in order to secure the best deal possible  in this manner you can be assured that any upcoming trip will be pleasant and free from any unexpected surprises view deals on car rental now you may also be interested in locksmiths one of the most frustrating experiences is to suddenly learn that we are locked out of our vehicle  unfortunately this normally occurs when we are least expecting it  whether on our way home read more ads related to cheapest suv to lease hyundai summer clearance event  san francisco suv dealers just like summer these deals

of mercedesbenz a song most famously recorded by singer janis joplin in the early s the tune gently poked fun at materialism and our desire for the finer things in life its fitting that the renowned german marque figures prominently in the lyric mercedesbenz has long been known for crafting vehicles that emphasize luxury and refinement for many its vehicles are sleek symbols of status success and good taste in january of  karl benz unveiled the worlds first automobile a threewheeled vehicle dubbed the benz patent motor car a few months later gottlieb daimler and his chief engineer wilhelm maybach rolled out a fourwheeled vehicle powered by his daimler engine the first mercedes was crafted in  shortly after daimlers death built by maybach the car was commissioned by emil jellinek one of daimlers primary distributors and was ultimately named after jellineks daughter mercedes in  the companies founded by daimler and benz merged to form daimlerbenz ag and the mercedesbenz brand was born the companys insignia was a threepointed star wreathed in a laurel the star was dreamed up by daimler years earlier and its three points signified the fact that his engines were used in vehicles that traveled land air and sea right from the start the mercedesbenz name was synonymous with automotive excellence one of the automakers earliest vehicles the  mercedesbenz  distinguished itself as the worlds first production car to offer a technology that was nothing short of extraordinary for the day fourwheel independent suspension the s and s saw mercedes establishing itself as the brand of choice for car buyers seeking the ultimate in luxury thanks to coveted cruisers like the  and k the s witnessed the introduction of the mercedesbenz  sl gullwing a sports car that has been described as being the worlds first supercar with its dramatic styling and racebred technology the  sl reigns today as a classic coveted by collectors worldwide the decade also saw daimlerbenz making strides in the area of safety technology the companys mercedesbenz  sedans were the first vehicles to incorporate its patented crumple zone body design created to absorb impact in the event of a crash in  the company cemented its reputation as the home of automotive luxury with the launch of the mercedesbenz  the elegant luxurious sedan was also available as a limousine and featured an aheadofitstime air suspension system and a v engine that boasted  horsepower the decade also saw the launch of the mercedesbenz  sel  this fullsize sedan went from zero to  in under seven seconds distinguishing itself as the quickest luxury car is its day the s saw the birth of the brands storied sclass line of vehicles opulent sedans and coupes that coddled passengers with powerful engines and a long list of luxury features the decade also saw mercedes continuing on the cutting edge of safety technology by being the first to offer antilock brakes in its vehicles daimlerbenzs safety advancements continued in the s its cars were the first to offer airbags and traction control the manufacturer also raised the bar in terms of ride comfort and handling when it introduced multilink rear suspension the technology debuted on the compact mercedesbenz  e and it remains a vital component of the companys chassis engineering to this day mercedesbenz vehicles got an extra dose of power and performance in the s thanks to the manufacturers partnership with amg a performance and tuning shop that was eventually purchased by the company to help produce ultrahighperformance versions of some of its vehicles the first amg model offered in the us was the sporty c amg in  since then mercedes has gone on to offer an amgtuned version of almost all of its vehicles the companys current lineup is the most comprehensive in its history with a variety of sedans coupes suvs and roadsters filling mercedes showrooms it seems like the only thing missing is a pickup truck surely the fact that janis joplins song holds as much relevance today as it did four decades ago is a strong indicator that the brands premier status is still very much intact hide mercedesbenz history advertisement research models
