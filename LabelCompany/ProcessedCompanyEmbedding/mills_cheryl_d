introduced saea’s chairman woongki kim as the most important person at the ceremony which included mrs clinton and the haitian prime ministermr kim would later become important to ms mills in a far more personal way — as a financial backer of a company she started after leaving the state department in  the company blackivy group is pursuing infrastructure projects in tanzania and ghana the only african nations in the “partnership for growth” an obama administration initiative that mrs clinton helped introduce that promotes investment in developing countriesthe partnership with mr kim sheds light on the business activities of ms mills — a longtime clinton loyalist who is likely to play a significant role in any future clinton white house — as well as the interlocking public and private relationships that have long characterized the clintons’ inner circle a lawyer ms mills has been a target of republican critics for her central role in determining which emails from mrs clinton’s

on haiti” and did not involve her activities at blackivy according to her spokesman eric londonsince teaming up through blackivy ms mills and mr kim have maintained close business ties appearing together last year for the opening of a new saea factory in costa rica where they cut the ribbon alongside costa rica’s president luis guillermo solís in africa representatives of the united states agency for international development have consulted with blackivy and saea about efforts to expand the textile trade in ghana where blackivy says the country’s centsanhour minimum wage “compares favorably” to higher wages in china bangladesh and vietnamfederal officials are barred from using their positions to negotiate future employment or exchange services for something of value and no evidence has emerged to suggest that occurred with blackivy both ms mills and mr kim deny that his investment was influenced by the substantial assistance she provided his company while serving as mrs clinton’s right hand at the state departmentms mills  declined to be interviewed for this article but mr london a blackivy spokesman said she had consulted with the state department ethics office before accepting mr kim’s investment “to ensure it was consistent with any rules that applied to her because of her service”“ms mills and mr kim met during her work for the state department in haiti during earthquake reconstruction” mr london said “she had no personal business ventures and no discussions about any prospective business with mr kim while she was at state”karen seo a spokeswoman for saea said the state department’s assistance in haiti played no role in mr kim’s decision to invest in blackivy his discussions about making the investment began in “late ” she said more than a year after ms mills had left the governmentms seo said that saea “currently has no plans to invest in garment and textile manufacturing facilities in africa” and that ms mills had no business relationship with saea outside of blackivy adding that her appearance with mr kim at the saea factory opening in costa rica was of a social nature “ms mills was invited and came to the costa rica event as a friend

haitieven before the january  earthquake the impoverished caribbean nation was the focus of attention from the clintons mr clinton whose foundation is active there had been named a united nations special envoy to haiti and as early as april  just a few months after becoming secretary of state mrs clinton was being forwarded emails from ms mills containing economic development ideassome of those ideas were from jeanlouis warnholz an economist whose consulting business provided “intelligence on african markets” in emails and meetings with the clintons and ms mills he advocated investment in textiles and agriculture as a way to create jobs a theory that was fasttracked in haiti after the earthquake with a proposal for an industrial park anchored by a major garment factoryms mills soon hired mr warnholz as her own adviser at the state department — he would later join her at blackivy — and the two worked closely to push the industrial park concept after overtures to another south

group she has described it as a “private operating company that builds commercial enterprises in subsaharan africa”mr kim was among a handful of prominent investors in blackivy according to a description that was once on blackivy’s website but has since been removed the deleted page carried the heading “our team” and listed in addition to mr kim continental grain a multinational agribusiness with operations in haiti steve case the founder of aol the wall street financier john mack the hedge fund founder raymond dalio and beck mack  oliver an investment firmthe executive chairman of blackivy is anthony welters a retired health insurance executive and longtime friend and mentor to ms mills who has raised money for mrs clinton’s campaign his son bryant works for blackivy and his wife beatrice wilkinson welters was the american ambassador to trinidad and tobago from  to in july two blackivy representatives including bryant welters met with government leaders in trinidad part of what the prime minister’s office there said was a visit to explore “avenues for doing business with trinidad and tobago”asked why blackivy was in the caribbean far outside its stated market areas in africa the company’s spokesman mr london said it had nothing to do with ms welters’s connections as a former ambassadorblackivy he said was not actually seeking business in trinidad but met with companies there “to learn about their successes in the region and to explore opportunities for them to establish operations in ghana and replicate those successes”what blackivy has accomplished so far is not clear it signed an agreement with officials in tanzania to develop a transportation hub but media reports there suggest it is progressing slowlya tanzanian government audit in march questioned how blackivy was chosen saying “there was no evidence” it was through a competitive bidding process mr london said competitive bidding was not needed because blackivy’s project is privately funded and there is no financial risk to the government advertisement continue reading the main story in ghana where blackivy has been pursuing an industrial park project a powerpoint presentation prepared by blackivy cited the country’s low minimum wage as one of several competitive advantages that made ghana “an ideal entry point to the west african market”defending the model of attracting investment with promises of cheap labor mr london offered an argument very similar to the one american officials made when explaining why saea’s factory would be good for haiti“the industrial park will increase manufacturing in ghana — creating jobs and catalyzing growth — which benefits the country and investors” he said “wages usually rise when manufacturing sectors expand and produce highervalue goods which is what we want to see in ghana”blackivy’s rationale did not sway labor advocates like scott nova the executive director of the worker rights consortium who had criticized the haiti project as a misguided american relief effort that glossed over saea’s laborrelations history“when you urge garment manufacturers producing in countries like bangladesh where wages are far too low for workers to adequately support their families to move production to countries with even lower wages it undercuts the efforts of apparel workers across the global south to persuade governments employers and major apparel brands to lift wages to a decent level” mr nova said continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you
