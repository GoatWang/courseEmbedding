managed future funds fees  expenses class action lawsuit skip to content skip to navigation class actions news real time for consumers investors and employees        search form search share on facebook tweet widget google plus one linkedin share button pinterest managed future funds fees  expenses class action lawsuit in november  bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managedfutures” funds  the conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled  of all the profit of that given fund a managedfutures fund  is an alternative investment which is often defined as an investment other than cash stocks or bonds  typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments  barcalyhedge estimates that over  billion was invested in managed accounts in mid  sec reporting requirements  one difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” the sec does however require that all managed futures funds with more than  investors and more than  million in assets file financial reports within  days of their fiscal year’s end  bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently  managedfutures funds that fit into this category the vast majority of managedfutures funds therefore have no reporting requirement as they are not subject to the  investor rule bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses bloomberg concluded that managedfutures funds can charge clients  to  each year of the investment amount in the fund plus  percent of the funds’ profits  hedge funds typically only charge a  management fee plus  of investor profits bloomberg next concluded that for the period from jan   to dec   a stunning  of the  billion of gains in these  managedfutures funds went to fees commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors  one example morgan stanley smith barney spectrum technical lp  people invested approximately  million in morgan stanleys managedfutures fund called morgan stanley smith barney spectrum technical lp from  through  the fund made approximately  million in trading gains and interest income however investors ended up losing money because those profits were depleted by over  million in commissions expenses and fees paid to fund managers and morgan stanley despite the funds value increase of approximately  million investors ended up losing approximately  million over

investment management services consist of acting as sponsor general partner manager investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and highnetworth hnw investors through the merrill lynch futuresaccess platform the futuresaccess platform provides access to mlai portfolio funds or portfolio managers in mlai’s advisory products or services many highnetworth investors understand very little about managed futures funds managed futures funds touted by merrill lynch’s financial advisors are recommended because the merrill lynch futuresaccess platform allegedly provides investors with access to an asset classes not readily available through traditional investments vehicles merrill lynch financial advisors recommend the futuresaccess managed futures funds to generate portfolio returns which they argue provide greater returns on a riskadjusted basis the purported low correlation of managed futures fund returns provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time highnetworth investors rely on merrill lynch managed futures fund managers as the experts at trading futures contracts however these highly misunderstood managed futures funds are laden with excessive fees costs and commissions which may dramatically impact potential investor’s return on investment the merrill lynch’s futuresaccess managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices ie developed and emerging markets interest rates ie us bonds eurodollar bonds eurobund commodities ie energy agriculture and metals and currencies ie dollar euro pound yen through investments in managed futures funds investors are allegedly able to invest in asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets which can result in greater riskadjusted returns for an investor’s total portfolio at issue for investors is the performance of merrill lynch’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account in most instances the investment advisor is compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management additionally an “incentivebased” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years this “performancebased” fee is usually paid net of all fees in addition to management and performance fees a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions the net result for investors has been the erosion of trading profits from a poorlyexplained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich merrill lynch the mlai futuresaccess platform are
