approach to address the inefficiencies in the large pool of fundamentally sound undervalued small public buyout quality companies the investment process combines a disciplined deep value based investment philosophy which leverages secular themes and groundlevel due diligence aof selectively partners with management teams operating executives and primary capital providers to create value by creating institutional interest in the firms portfolio companies aof mitigates market risk though consistent hedging and creates incremental alpha through tactical shorting active owners funds investment style is as that of an active value investor value because the fund will typically invest in companies that are considered to be trading for less than their intrinsic value and active because the fund will seek to act as a friendly catalyst to drive value creation the principals believe their shared perspective to be very similar to that of private equity investors like such investors aof takes an ownership mentality and will look to invest in those companies in which the principals believe their skill sets and relationships will help to create value if a company does all the right things but its intrinsic value continues to go unrecognized by the market then aof will generally seek to work with management and its shareholders to initiate some form of catalyst event
