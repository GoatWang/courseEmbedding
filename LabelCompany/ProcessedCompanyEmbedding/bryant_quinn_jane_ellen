surged across the boundary separating the womens or lifestyle sections and into the formerly male bastions of the editorial financial medical and oped pages where men previously controlled the nations news organizations were the chief opinion givers and defined what is newsworthy many women newspaper columnists are now nationally syndicated and tackle the same subjects as their male counterparts bringing with them distinctive styles and viewpoints through these frank and lively interviews maria braden explores the lives and work of columnists erma bombeck jane brody mona charen merlene davis georgie anne geyer dorothy gilliam ellen goodman molly ivins mary mcgrory judith miss manners martin joyce maynard anna quindlen and jane bryant quinn profiles describe how these writers got started where they get the nerve to tell the world what they think how they generate ideas for columns and what its like to create under the pressure of deadlines representative columns illustrate their distinctive voices and an introductory essay provides a historical overview of women in journalism including pioneering women columnists fanny fern dorothy thompson and sylvia porter braden finds that todays women columnists frequently raise issues or use examples unique to their gender because they are likely to have a direct personal connection to current social issues such as abortion child care or sexual harassment they are able to provide fresh perspectives on these provocative topics in doing so they are helping to define what isworthy of attention in the s and to shape public response a unique addition to the literature on women in journalism this book will interest general readers as well as students of journalism literature american studies and womens studies aspiring writers will find here role models and practical guidance review by booklist review female columnists are finally being heard from the wry observations of housefrau erma bombeck to the literate literary joyce maynard to the liberal consciousness of ellen goodman to the personalpolitical approach of anna quinlan these women have attacked the issues of the day and brought powerful points of view to the public notice easily identifiable with a female audience their voices are finally reaching men too and as a result changing the way americans think about the core issues they grapple with daily braden a journalism teacher opens her book with a chapter on the history and influence of female columnists she follows with excerpts from columns by  of the better well known columnists as well as interviews with them in which they discuss their life and work the interviews round out their personalities and offer the reader insight into the process of creating a column mary ellen sullivan from booklist copyright c american library association used with permission review by publishers weekly review in a book which should appeal to journalists and to those involved with womens studies braden

globe associate editor ellen goodman syndicated conservative political columnist mona charon judith martin miss manners and others two black women are included dorothy gilliam of the washington post
