creative planning inc leawoodbased creative planning inc has been on an epic run receiving steady accolades as one of the nations best feeonly wealth advisory firms but its most recent win is surrounded by a bit of industry controversy creative planning has been named as the no  feeonly wealth management firm in the united states by barrons magazine for the past two years recently it earned the same honors from cnbc also for the second year in a row enlarge peter mallouk president of creative planning inc creative planning inc all that national recognition along with a solid business plan and an experienced team of advisers who establish strong relationships with clients and deliver solid results put creative planning on an incredibly strong growth path founded in  with about  million in assets under management the firm has grown to about  billion i think the shift in the marketplace is toward conflictfree advice and that has really benefited firms like ours founder peter mallouk said at the end of the day were excited that clients like what we do and continue to come to creative planning and refer others to our firm its being noticed on a national scale but cnbcs recent list of the nations top wealth advisers is coming under fire by michael kitces a wellknown commentator and editor of the journal of financial planning kitces published a blog questioning whether nine of the  firms recognized by cnbc truly have a feeonly structure including creative planning kitces argued that those nine firms dont qualify under the certified financial planning boards strict definition of feeonly because they share in insurance commissions or are referring clients to insurance affiliates they own some of creative plannings personnel that are insurance agents may receive commissions for the sale of insurance products kitces wrote the receipt of insurance commissions is in addition to any advisory fees charged by creative planning mallouk doesnt deny that statement is true however he said that  percent of the insurance business at creative planning is group life or term life insurance mainly done separately for clients who own businesses and asked for help none of that business involves the variable life insurance or variable annuities that certainly could be viewed as a conflict of interest we do not have a brokerdealer affiliation which means no one here is licensed to sell a commissionable investment or product like a variable life insurance policy or a variable annuity mallouk said that makes us a pure registered investment adviser we dont have a brokerage side to the business so i think when people look at an investment manger and ask are there other ways they can get paid on the investments the answer with creative planning is no
