sociology and scientism william f ogburn   sociology and scientism the case of william f ogburn robert c bannister paper presented at the annual meeting of the american sociological society  in his presidential address to the american sociological society in december  william fielding ogburn told colleagues that sociology was not interested in improving the world science is interested directly in one thing only to wit discovering new knowledge this goal required a wholly colorless literary style and a rigorous method preferably statistical the truly scientific sociologist a service intellectual rather than a policy maker would not pretend to guide the course of evolution but rather would generate the information necessary for such supreme direction to some sterling executive who will appear to do the actual guiding statistical and advisory a truly scientific sociology would also be nominalist in its basic assumptions since society was simply a term for the collective responses of the individuals who comprised it sociology should confine itself to the measurement and tabulation of environmental change and responses to it  ogburn by this time was a leading proponent of a movement within american social science that had been building for more than a decade alternately termed neopositivism objectivism or more pejoratively scientism at its core the objectivists held not only that science can provide mankind with an allembracing philosophy of life and the solution to all problems but that the techniques used in the physical sciences can be used to solve any problem accordingly those disciplines that do not use the same research techniques as the physical sciences are not really scientific the sociologists definition of science was not of course necessarily that which scientists themselves followed in their work but rather that which ogburn and others believed that they employed but in the enthusiasm of the moment the finer points tended to get lost a scientific sociology  as thus defined was to be objective in three quite special senses first it must confine itself to the observable externals of human behavior this goal meant an end to the cataloguing of feelings interests or wishes a principal activity of prewar sociologists secondly sociologists must apply rigorous methods in the production of social scientific knowledge  finally sociologists should observe strict neutrality in matters of ethics and public policy from these premises certain predilections followed naturally if not inevitably specifically a focus on individual behavior rather than on the formation and transformation of social structures an emphasis on an inductive and incremental model of science and in the long run a bureaucratic vision of team research and social science institutes in practice objectivism translated into programs that ranged from educational testing to marriage counselling politically it fueled demands for increasing social control since objectivity in one form or other had been a professional norm since the earliest days of sociology these maxims and the assumptions behind them were not entirely new what distinguished ogburn and his disciples was the extreme to which they took them and in particular the extreme to which they took the premise that human volition and the subjective consciousness have no place in social science underlying earlier studies of interests small likemindedness giddings and even instincts lay the assumption that a connection existed between human feelings and values and the existing social order for the earlier functionalists social institutions arose to satisfy needs in ways compatible with the well being of individuals and group survival scientism in contrast repudiated not only the inner self but all customary ways of doing and feeling objectivity lay not simply in the lack of bias but in the elimination of the psychological dimensions of experience and finally of the willing feeling self ogburns prominence within the profession gave his pronouncements special weight born and educated in the south he had done his graduate work under franklin giddings at columbia and in  earned his phd for a statistical study of child labor legislation in social change  he introduced the phrase cultural lag  during the s he represented sociology at the social science research council in  he joined the faculty at the university of chicago later chairing the sociology department during a period it which it produced more than a hundred phds including some of the leading quantifiers of the next generation ogburns pioneering study of the  election earned him a minor footnote in histories of quantitative social science from  to  he served as editor of the journal of the american statistical association and in  was elected president of the association as research director of president herbert hoovers committee on social trends he played a pivotal role in producing the pathbreaking recent social trends  during the depression years he served on several new deal agencies after world war ii he became one of the nations best known analysts of the impact of technology on society although he shunned controversy ogburn was and remains a controversial figure during the thirties humanists pictured him as an uncritical apologist for technology  while fellow sociologists usually to the left questioned the analytic utility and value neutrality of the cultural lag concept  during the s new left critics pictured him him as the archetypal corporate liberal and a chief architect in one version of the strippeddown companionate family that promised but did not finally provide a haven from a heartless capitalism   at best ogburn seemed to one latterday quantifier to have been a transitional figure in the disciplines move from a biological to a more genuinely cultural analysis from general theory to quantitative research and from social evolutionism to a nonteleological positivism differences over ogburns reputation in turn reflect more general questions concerning the rise of sociological objectivism the objectivists themselves in the tradition of positivism since comte argued that the logic of science led inexorably from metaphysics to quantification the image of a transitional ogburn being an attenuated version of this position more recently historians of sociology have stressed the impersonal processes of the professionalization and bureaucratization of knowledge or the rise of corporatism as chief factors although not rejecting these later explanations this study of ogburns career attempts to place them against a broader background of socialpsychological religious  and intellectual factors that shaped the vision of key representatives of sociologys second generation who earned their doctorates on the eve of world war i  socially objectivism was nourished by the fluidity and resulting absence of tradition and custom that characterized late th century american life as the rise of a national economy and transportation network shattered what remained of provincial culture social deference and traditional values analysis of this situation in terms of nostalgia or loss of status as richard hofstadter suggested a generation ago ignores the more basic lack of institutional density that in stable societies defines roles mediates meanings and induces the comfortable feeling that shared values are a natural and enduring aspect of the human condition for founders like small and giddings as for most of their middleclass contemporaries socially secure and relatively comfortable upbringings muted the stark opposition of self and society individual and nature significantly the prewar sociologists who anticipated objectivism were also the most rootless from sumner ross and veblen in sociology to jb watson in psychology ogburn nicely fits the bill born and raised in a small georgia town he revered a past he never quite understood his family on both sides traced its american ancestry to th century virginia a point of special pride to his mother both his parents remained close to brothers and sisters throughout their lives yet to ogburn theirs seemed another world they lived in a face to face community he wrote using the phrase charles h cooley had coined i have known the point intellectually but i never quite got the feel of it it is still something of a mystery ogburns lineage alternately fascinated and embarrassed him when at the faculty table at the university of chicago someone casually asked him if a miss jane ogburn were his sister he answered somewhat to his own surprise no my original ancestor came over in  sic and her original ancestor did not get here until  repeating the incident to read bain he confided there were two or three men around the table whose fathers were born in europe and it did not take long for someone to crack down upon me with a remark about my blue blood which increased my confusion one day toward the end of his life he spent an afternoon tracing the genealogy of one of his forebears only to recognize the absurdity of the enterprise had not modern studies shown that ones personality was the product of the social environment he wondered had not the same studies taken allor nearly all meaningfrom a study of ancestry  ogburns own youth marked a sharp break from this family past after his father died while he was quite young his mother took in borders to make ends meet as a boy i carried a good deal of responsibility and had little money which i had to stretch for the family he recalled under these circumstances family pride became extreme sensitivity to reputation and a compulsion to conform on the streets of smalltown georgia gossip was a deadly weapon and a good name the most valued of possessions in later years ogburns concern for normality and his distrust of eccentricity amounted to an obsession the truth is i love i think to be ordinary to be like my fellow man not to be an extreme deviate he once wrote in his private journal this view shaped his attitudes toward matters great and small of success in ones career he commented all big shots do things appropriately but a sense of appropriateness is a distinct asseti have known a few people who might have been big shots if they had not been awkward inept and given to saying the wrong thing at the wrong time after an evening in the company of edward ross and his new wife he commented nothing queer or eccentric about either and of a christmas card from a friend less eccentric than any they have sent in a selfcritical mood he speculated that this same attitude probably explained his penchant for research that earned prestige rather than money when more profitable opportunities beckoned the big idea is that we do the things that are highly socially valued and research is the goal we must all strive for like other objectivists ogburn translated this concern for reputation into the view that human behavior was a response to stimulus rather than the organization of habits around a preexisting or sociallycreated self all members of the human species do not respond exactly to the same material stimulus he noted but all actions are nonetheless responses to stimuli so persuaded he sometimes spoke of himself and his professional activities as objects over which he had little control despite sometimes frenetic professional activity he frequently commented on his lack of ambition rather he was driven on by a sense of duty or in response to the general idea inculcated in youth to do the immediate job ahead rather wellbut no great ego no great desire to leave my mark on the world in later years ogburn likewise ascribed his success to circumstance rather than to effort or ambition despite the fact that both were considerable although he owed his appointment at columbia in  in part to the efforts of elizabeth bf baker an economist who joined the bernard department the same year he attributed it to the impersonal working of social forces whose time had come the fact that i was offered a professorship at yale on the same day that i received the offer from columbia should be considered evidence on this point similarly he credited his position on the ssrc and other professional bodies less to his own efforts than to the good fortune of being in the right group at the right time in their passion for democracy for egalitarianism and for race equality sociologists too often overlook the fortuitous he once commented as a southerner when such things mattered even more than today ogburn also inherited other traditions that seemed somehow archaic in the new era of the sregarding women chivalry honor money courage etc like many of his generation he absorbed these virtues from reading the victoriansthackeray dickens and especially sir walter scott one ideal i recall was that it was not good for a strong man to talk much he added a brave courageous man was a man of few words too much talk was feminine to be garrulous was to be a sissy remembering this wisdom ogburn years later urged fellowsociologists to cultivate a nofrills literary style and to eschew the conventional graces for the rest of his years ogburns life was a battle between illusion and reality youthful ideals and a world that that seemed to render them meaningless nowhere was this more pronounced than in his view of women as a southerner he got a double dose of the victorian cult of true womanhood i started off in my youth with a strong sense of chivalry he remembered i never had any sisters and i reverenced my mother converted to feminism he supported total sexual equality but premised on the belief that women were unselfish angels reality eventually checked this fantasy many modern women were narcissistic selfcenteredinterested only in themselves he decided although they demanded equality most women wanted men to dominate them to take responsibility even to bully them the result of this realization was a frank lament here i have been treating them as superior beings who want freedom and rights but so many of them do not in face of the erosion of traditional sex roles facts were sternly masculine and speculation a dangerous feminine allurement during the progressive era ogburn in his way became something of a rebel leaving home in  he studied at nearby mercer college  where he developed a fascination for wildernesswhether embodied in wild animals primitive men or even the wanderings of gypsies and hoboes as with several other leading objectivists although with less scandalous effect his rebellion focused on restrictions on sex as he later recalled  freedom of speech or thought never bothered me i think i rebelled against sham against pretense against conventional morality yet wilderness and the freedom it promised was as frightening as it was fascinating he finally decided that it was not the wilderness of sex he wanted but a better code a trip to paris in  ogburns first outside georgia brought him face to face with the perils of liberation i was young naive modest not selfassertive wellmannered and reasonably normal he recalled i met many queer characters who were egotistical selfcentered or loved power who bullied me with their views the like of which i had never heard because i was a listener not selfassertive and had good mannersthere were russians poets artists jews anarchists socialists social workers english french etc but nearly all queer during his stay he was drawn irresistibly to art and spent thirty successive days in the louvre but the beauty there also frightened him it was an unreal a dream world the world of beautiful pictures he later wrote afterward when i began my long fight for reality i was always a bit afraid to visit the louvre again afraid that i might become intoxicated and take a long flight from reality again whether this reference was to a real or metaphoric breakdown ogburn gradually began to structure a rigid separation between his public and private self for the sociologist exact measurement was an antidote to illusion statistics the basis of a better code professionalism provided rules for the office but not for the home very definitely i would like to confine my peculiarities which are due to my occupation to my hours of duty on the job he resolved upon his retirement like many americans in the twenties the private ogburn developed a passion for sports he loved boxing and baseball and had a passion for tennis which he played regularly until his death however he never let himself go completely although he loved sporting events he once commented i hardly ever go i have the technique of denial down pretty well although coming from different regions and social class other leading objectivists experienced a similar disjuncture between past and present self and the world as a group their backgrounds were significantly different from the comfortable middle class ones of most eastern and midwestern progressive reformers half a generation or more older f stuart chapin the descendent of many generations of new york patricians whose fortunes were temporarily in decline luther l bernard the son of a neerdowell west texas farmer read bain born in backwoods oregon raised by a divorced mother and her paramour then psychologically adopted as he later put it by an older woman following his own mothers premature death and george lundberg born in rural south dakota of a swedish immigrant women who was herself an orphan whereas the celebration of community and social cohesionthe language of charles horton cooley and likeminded progressivesincorporated a nostalgic longing for a past social order the objectivists language of efficiency and social engineering judged the past to be irredeemably irrelevant   objectivism was also a chapter in the transformation of american protestantism although in ways different than in most account of the clerical connections of many early american sociologists viewed superficially objectivism would appear to be resolutely irreligious most objectivists were distinguished by their rejection of andor indifference toward the religion of their youth from giddings onward battles over scientific sociology pitted individuals who in one fashion or other had rejected their childhood religion against those who remained faithful to it yet in more important respects objectivism owed a great deal to religion and more specifically to the calvinist strain within american protestantism on the most obvious level its vision of an efficient social order contained more than a little missionary zeal while its celebration of hard facts and the rigors of research brought the protestant ethic into the era of modern professionalism at a deeper level the objectivist program with its behaviorist assumptions marked both a rejection of christian conception soul being translated to self conscience to consciousness and a restatement of the calvinist impulse to control for provincials raised on the pieties of th century calvinism new york and chicago about  were scary places rendering consciousness not less than conscience a problem by explaining human activity in terms of stimulus and response objectivism subtly relieved urban newcomers of moral responsibility at the same time the reification of behavior whether ones own or of others allowed objectivists to control an otherwise threatening situation thus in a sense they enjoyed the special pleasure of playing god while denying his existence finally and more speculatively calvinism as opposed to other traditions of natural theology or rational religion disposed its practitioners to accept the idea that there was an order in the universe despite the fact that its causes good not be immediately knownso disposed ogburn and other leading objectivists notably giddings and chapin were more inclined to take darwinian selectionism more seriously than for example did small or sumner from it they proceed to a nominalist and statistical conception of natural and social law the fundamental premise of their objectivism since ogburn was virtually silent concerning his religious background and spoke of religion less frequently than most objectivists evidence for this interpretation is admittedly indirect in his case his georgia background and early training at the baptist mercer college the missionary zeal he brought to the cause and his dogged sense of duty and determined selfdenial his tendency to speak of his professional self as a product of circumstance rather than of volition while privately he sought emotional outlets in exotic travel and even fiction writing under a nom de plume to these things one should add his steady intellectual development from the social selectionism of his doctoral thesis to his emphasis on statistics a subject too complex to be discussed here in a general way ogburn himself in his later years confessed that he was not as far removed from religion as he had imagined my worship of statistics has a somewhat religious nature  he noted in his journal at a time when his enthusiasm was fading statistics had been his god but god only meets an emotional need which has little to do with reason    objectivism thirdly was a byproduct of the professionalization of scholarship although not the only or the inevitable one among the many impulses that shaped th century professionalism a prominent one as burton bledstein has argued was the desire to consolidate and control from their fascination with words the jargon of the different specialities to their claims of autonomy professionals embodied the victorian effort to set apart regulate and contain the different elements of an increasingly chaotic experience and to transcend the partisan strife that threatened to destroy society and to undermine the recentlywon power of the wasp middle class offering more than psychic comfort although this too the allembracing standard of science in bledsteins words provided the raison detre of the middle classand justified its standard of living viewed in this light ogburns objectivism appears in one sense to have been an extreme of professionalism indeed almost a caricature of its openended demand for work organized procedures for obtaining credentials and claim of disinterested service but the objectivists sharp distinction between public and private and the fact that the objectivists in their private lives were less than the model of professional rationality suggest that this regimen exacted its own price at its most benign the professionals bifurcation of self into public and private scientist and citizen led to escapes in poetry painting sports or travel at its worst the jargon of objectivity and disinterested activity masked chaotic inner lives that led ogburn at one point to psychoanalysis and another prominent objectivist to compulsive philandering for the profession as a whole the pretense of superior rationality as read bain finally observed did not rule out often vicious squabbling and backbiting the institutionalization and specialization of scholarship first within the university and later within foundationsponsored institutes also played a part within the universities several factors together narrowed the scope of the discipline including the need to defend and define the newcomer against the other social sciences a circumstance that differed from one university to another the need to devise easily reproducible methods for the training of graduate students as early evident in the case of giddings and perhaps even the practical realization that grand theory on the style of spencer or ward assumed more knowledge that the average undergraduate commanded in the age of free electives in choosing columbia for graduate work ogburn found himself in an environment where these narrowing tendencies were well advanced a highlyprofessionalized faculty and an interest in statistics antedated the establishment of sociology in the early s ogburns mentor giddings in his inductive sociology  produced one of the earliest research manuals for graduate students in the decade before the war giddings imposed rigid research models on his doctoral students first in a series of community studies and later in quantitative studies of social issues of which ogburns thesis was a prime example progressivism and then war offered ogburn and other members of their stillfragile discipline both incentive and opportunity to prove their professionalism and public worth again as illustrated particularly in ogburns case teaching at reed and the university of washington during the war years ogburn honed his statistical skills in various studies of public affairs the existence of such new procedures as the initiative and referendum whatever the outcome of the elections provided a chance to gather data on an unprecedented scale for one study ogburn generated statistics on voting in more than twenty counties on one hundred and three issues over a fouryear period in  he spent a year working for the cost of living section of the national war labor board and the bureau of statistics travelling up and down the west coast surveying industry labor and social conditions the usefulness of statistics he later noted with characteristic understatement was very apparent during the war  during the s ogburns association with the social science research council helped refine his nominalist conception of the discipline established in  the ssrc had two basic objectives to foster empirical inductive scientific research and to break down the barriers that divided the disciplines in theory the two might appear contradictory the first looking to narrow and more specialized studies the second premised on the ideal of the unity of knowledge in practice however the two converged in a nominalist definition of science the unity of the social sciences lay in their methods rather than their material there was integration one political scientist explained but it was an integration along new scientific and methodological lines  in the ssrc this maxim was effectively institutionalized the emergence of objectivism however also underlines the danger of a tooexclusive emphasis on the professionalizationinstitutionalization model particularly in unilinear versions that typically overestimate the strength and success of the processfor the s evidence of this weakness may be seen in the dream of economists and others of professional associations modeled on the german verein fur sozialpolitik which would oppose strict definitions of science on their disciplines in the case of economics and in such departments as smalls at johns hopkins the dream quickly gave way to decentralized and diverse organization future sociologists coexisted with historians and remained yoked to economists however uneasily for almost two decades as a result sociology remained imperfectly professionalized through the interwar period uncertain of its boundaries sensitive to attack and a tempting target for any group that wished to promote a new paradigm objectivism rather than being the end product of a unilinear professionalization was a symptom of this volubility american sociology began as a discipline with no agreedupon theory or coherent research area it never dropped the appeal to utility and it altered its initial boundaries in dramatic ways first in the triumph of the group concept in the s later with the ascendency of structuralfunctionalism in the s and finally with the nearanarchy that has obtained since the s ogburns bid to redefine the discipline in the  presidential address to the ass was one of many that had wracked the discipline since its founding in the end the attempt to impose restrictive definitions of sociology within the ass during the s finally came up against the same centripetal forces that earlier kept american scholarship from developing along european lines  political disillusion and alienation completed ogburns conversion to the serviceintellectual conception of social science although in his youth he resisted the pat formulations of selfproclaimed reformers he became something of a radical during his west coast dayscelebrating the oregon system of direct democracy and even showing enthusiasm for the wobblies in his classroom he preached the economic interpretation of history then as now a standard item in the arsenal of the left   during the war years however the several components of this wouldbe radicalism gradually dissolved the first tests of the initiative and referendum in oregon yielded prohibition and antiimmigration laws both signs of reaction and hence a blow to his faith in direct democracy a study of the opinions of different social classes on public issues convinced him that wobbly predictions of imminent class warfare were unfounded wartime passions and propaganda then destroyed what remained of his belief in human rationality the premise of his economic interpretation of history  this disillusion in turn set the stage for social change  his bestknown book ogburns starting point was the apparent contradiction between the model of human rationality implicit in the economic interpretation and mounting evidence of irrationality following freud he initially decided that economic motives like sexual impulses were hidden or disguised an example being the wartime use of the iww as a scapegoat but as he thought about it he decided that the time factor was more important than the disguise factor that is the conflict between economic interests and announced motives was not the product of selfdeception based on unconscious drives but of different rate of change among the several elements that made up culture hence the widespread view that womens place is in the home was not an unconscious rationalization of disguised male economic privilege but the result of a gap between traditional cultural values and the technological realities that made them outmoded this gap he termed cultural lag for present purposes this formulation was important because it implied that sociologists should henceforth devote their energies to measuring rates of change in different areas of human activity rather than to constructing grand theories of evolution or of the ideal society such was the theory that ultimately led to ogburns  address to the ass politically social change was also ambivalent when measured by prewar standards of reform as revealed by the fact that some readers attempted to give it a reformist interpretation while others criticized its technological determinism and apparent fatalism ogburns proposals although fragmentary by his own admission in fact looked neither to social justice or governmental controls on the one hand nor to rugged individualism and laissez faire on the other but rather to the good life in a welladjusted consumeroriented leisured society more enlightened attitudes toward sex perhaps earlier sex education might relieve psychoses and neuroses he speculated the sublimation of sexual energies into creative activities and an increase in sports and recreation would also help whereas earlier progressives had urged the channeling of private passion into public projects lester ward for example ogburn argued in effect that americans should frankly accept the separation of public and private sphere in the modern world recreation and sexual fulfillment would foster adjustment to a situation one could or would not change what did this posture mean in practice an illuminating if limited answer can be found in an interesting confession ogburn later made in his journal concerning his dealings with jews a number of whom were already prominent within the professionseeing discrimination during his columbia years he spent great gobs of time helping jews obtain jobs and fellowships but their aggression ego contempt etc soon got under his skin invited to dinner parties he would wonder if mr  a jew would be there or prof  a jew was invited if so i braced myself for a bad time finally he asked himself why i have to be so damned nice to the jews if i do not enjoy them at the same time he realized how unjust it was to endow the individual with the traits of the race faced with this dilemma a th century liberal ideally might have reread john locke on natural rights or quoted the declaration of independence ogburn instead took a poll listing thirtyfive jews he had known at columbia and at chicago and a random list of thirtyfive nonjews he compared the two for ten to fifteen objectional traits often attributed to jews the result showed that  percent of the jews had the traits but only  percent of the nonjews so i declared my independence of my conscience about the jews he concluded this tortured dairy entry and i am not nice to those i dont like no matter how much i sympathize or how well i understand how they got that way ogburns response to hitler and fascism raised further questions concerning the ideological payoff of his objectivity although there exists little direct evidence of ogburns position on the issue during the late s indirect evidence suggests that some colleagues felt that he was soft on fascism the consensus expressed about you was that your professional careerhas been seriously marred and your reputation injured by your nonbelief in democracy and your obsession with and your fondness and admiration for totalitarian dictatorships one former student wrote him after the war shocked to hear him being so criticized during a princeton conference your friends cited the fact that you seemed to be pronazi in the late thirties even up to pearl harbor they now say you are just as strongly in favor of the soviets and that you evidently adhere to a totalitarian form of government nor was she comforted when another friend defended ogburn saying he was reported as pronazi merely because of the absurd notion you had that you could view objectively a war in which the world was involved and remain neutral although the letter shocked ogburn jerked me up quick his explanations in his diary left the cloud hanging he did admire organization and efficiency he did despise hatred even when directed against hitler at a meeting in june  to hear the impressions of a former head of the associated press in berlin for example he found himself marvelling at the skill of the nazi propaganda machine not admiration of course for the end but for the means while others listened with contempt disgust and horror he reflected to himself that the propaganda minister was only doing what every family fraternity and college does in indoctrinating its memberswas he psychotic was he in any way abnormal no he decided but he disliked seeing his colleagues so emotional and so hating and then there was that lonely feeling was ogburn thus an antisemite or profascist certainly not in the sense that he openly supported antidemocratic causes or espoused antiliberal ideas during the depression years he worked tirelessly for numerous new deal agencies and privately although not publicly developed great admiration for franklin and eleanor roosevelt but his journal confessions alone suggest that he himself was aware that his objectivist principles had eroded his liberalism in its implicit preference for order over freedom its focus on efficiency over humanity and its substitution for probability predictions for selfevident natural or moral laws what finally of corporatism if ogburn was not profascist noropenly antidemocratic did he not serve and even help create through he work on the ssrc the foundations and new deal agencies the alliance between business government and the university intelligensia which the critics of corporatism denounce if one may distinguish corporatism as conscious policy from its de facto emergence in the interwar years the answer in ogburns case is not guilty on the first count although probably guilty by association on the secondsince ogburn insisted that the sociologist qua scientist should make no policy recommendations he scarcely qualifies as a corporatist theorist after a year with the national recovery administration for example he reported that governmentbusiness cooperation was a prominent feature of the early new deal even speculating that it might be the wave of the future but he also reported in objective fashion that it raised the perennial question of the balance between freedom and order an issue upon which he would venture no opinion  guilt by association may be another matter at least to the degree that a case can be made the the foundations and the academic experts they sponsored were an integral part of new era capitalism social change as noted above also provided a blueprint for a consumerist leisured society adjusted to the technological imperatives of modern industry the irony of course was that this blueprint in ogburn case was the work of a displaced southerner suspended between traditions he loved but would not accept and an order he accepted but would not love carrying this analysis further one might argue that it was no coincidence that ogburn and his fellow objectivists stood ready and willing to serve the functions they did in the world of government and the foundations or that their work indirectly at least hould have shaped the corporatist consumerist order since the same forces that produced this order were responsible for the social and cultural crisis that gave rise to their objectivism in the first place for present purposes however the central point is that the quest for objectivity as represented by ogburn was not an inevitable unforlding of the logic of science but a product of historical forces that converged on the generation that came of age intellectually on the eve of world war i objectivity that is has a history no less than other chapters in human history although some sociologists continue to reisist the point although ogburn enjoyed professional success and prestige until his death in  and the positivist spirit he represented has scarcely disappeared from american sociology the second world war cast a pall over the extreme and often naive scientism of the interwar period just as the first world war had contributed to its risesince he s numerous charges were levelled against the entire objectivist program that it ignored the realities of power exploitation and conflict that it narrowed the focus of sociology to parochial and often trivial concerns and that it failed to see the cultural class and most recently gender biases of its own ideal of objectivity whether or not one accepts this indictment this essay has attempted to identify the rather special conditions in the shaping of modern america that produced this chapter in american thought whether these conditions have changed significantly and with them the assumptions they bred remains an open

search enter your keywords search toggle navigation william f ogburn william fielding ogburn june   — april   william fielding ogburn served as president of the american sociological society later changed to association in  his presidential address the folkways of a scientific sociology was delivered at the organizations annual meeting in washingtondc in december  and was later published int he proceedings of the  meeting howard w odum in his  book american sociology the story of sociology in the united states through  provided the following biographical sketch of william f ogburn pages  going directly to graduate work at columbia university with giddings in  three years after his graduation from georgias mercer university in  william f ogburn the nineteenth president of the american sociological society was the first to make sociology his first and last field of professional work that is after his excursion into secondaryschool teaching as was customary with most graduates of georgia colleges who expected to go into professional work ogburn began his studies in sociology and was still going strong at the  mark his only transitional excursion away from sociology was as instructor at princeton university in economics politics and history while he was working for his phd degree in sociology at columbia unless his year of postwar economic studies in france or his presidency of the american statistical association could be so designated born in butler georgia in  and having received the bs degree from mercer university at macon georgia and the ma degree in  from columbia university and the phd in  he was professor of sociology at reed college portland oregon for four years where he did what he sometimes estimates his best teaching following the reed college tenure he was for two years  and  in world war i examiner and head of the cost of living department for the national war labor board and special agent for the united states bureau of labor statistics following this service he came back to columbia university as professor of sociology in  where he remained until  when he was called to chicago to serve in a similar capacity in  he was appointed to the sewell l avery distinguished service professorship and has remained there continuously except for leaves of absence granted to undertake special work he received the honorary degree of lld from his alma mater and from the university of north carolina like his predecessors among the presidents of the american sociological society he has been called on to cooperate in many ventures and to undertake much in allied fields although giddings had been the sociological pioneer in insisting that statistics be given a major role in sociology and although he had been a fellow in the american statistical association ogburn was a president of the association and editor of its journal so too although several of the presidents of the american sociological society have been fellows in the american association for the advancement of science ogburn has been the only vicepresident up to  and again ogburn has been the only sociologist to be president of the social science research council and chairman of its problems and policy committee other related scientific associations included the international statistical institute the population association of america the sociological research association his active and advisory services to outside agencies have also been numerous he was chairman of the united states census advisory committee director of the consumers advisory board of the national recovery administration special adviser to the resettlement administration and research consultant to the national resources committee  his most distinctive cooperative research effort however was his directorship of the presidents research committee on social trends established by president herbert hoover and running from  to ogburn not only was mainly responsible for the outlines and arrangements for this study but the appropriation of more than a half million dollars for the study by the rockefeller foundation was facilitated by ogburns directing the study another president of the society howard w odum who had initiated the request for the appropriation was assistant director of research while the other members of the committee were wesley c mitchell of columbia chairman charles e merriam of chicago vicechairman shelby harrison of the russell sage foundation and alice hamilton of harvard the results of this cooperative research program were published in two main volumes of thirtyfour chapters by almost as many collaborators in addition to the zoopage summary and thirteen separate monographs ogburn himself contributed two of the main chapters dealing with science invention and social change and with marriage and family relationships in this work ogburn was able to urge upon the committee one of his major indices of methodology namely that research be undertaken in no area unless statistical data were available for objective measurement and in those cases where the major authors had not had access to or experience in statistical research it was the policy of the committee to provide statistical assistants thus samuel stouffer subsequently to go as professor of sociology and director of the research laboratory of social relations at harvard collaborated with jesse f steiner in his excellent chapter on the community and recreational activities and clarence heer professor of finance at north carolina collaborated with howard w odum in his chapter on public welfare ogburns main books and brochures included progress and uniformity in childlabor legislation a study in statistical measurement published as his phd thesis  social change with respect to culture and original nature  the social sciences and their interrelations edited jointly by ogburn and alexander goldenweiser  american marriage and family relationships with e r groves  the economic development of postwar france a survey of production with william joffé  social changes edited for the american journal of sociology and published each year  to  recent social trends  sociology — a textbook with meyer f nimkoff  american society in wartime edited  the social effects of aviation  a revised edition of social change appeared in  in addition to these books a number of smaller pamphlets have been published most important of these are living with machines  you and machines  social characteristics of cities a basis for new interpretations of the role of the city in american life  technological trends and national policy  machines and tomorrows world  war babies and the future  the politics of atomic energy  few men in american sociology have equaled ogburn in sheer quantity of output of articles for journals not including book reviews approximately a hundred and seventyfive such articles have appeared in addition to approximately twenty chapters written for and published in books edited by others according to the chief subject matter and to journals carrying them these journals have been divided into two groups in an unpublished paper in   learned and technical journals and  popular magazines the number of articles appearing in the learned and technical journals include fiftythree from sociological journals including the american journal of sociology social forces publications of the american sociological society annals of the american academy of political and social science sociology and social research the range of his contributions is indicated by some eightyfive articles in other journals including public management journal of the american statistical association survey graphic monthly labor review political science quarterly scientific monthly journal of political economy american political science review american economic review state review of literature journal of adult education american labor year book there have been some fifty articles in popular magazines and newspapers including the new york times the berliner tageblatt air affairs american magazine ladies home journal nations business although ogburn may not be as noted as his teacher giddings was for the creation of a great many sociological terms and concepts his term cultural lag defined sociologically for the first time in his book social change has become a classic as ogburn defined it on page  of this book the thesis is    that the source of most modern social changes today is the material culture the materialculture changes force changes in other parts of culture such as social organization and customs but these latter parts of culture do not change as quickly they lag behind the materialculture changes hence we are living in a period of maladjustment ogburn writes i think we have made a good deal of progress in the scientific method in sociology since you and i were in the graduate school together at columbia university and i think the united states is far ahead of any other country especially continental europe in scientific sociology but at best the movement will be slow i think much too much attention is given to systematization and not enough to verification on the other hand i am not a perfectionist if i were i would advocate a restriction of effort to a narrow field such as statistical surveys population studies and vital statistics i think the degree of accuracy and the extent of verification is contingent upon the need in laying out work and i am not disposed to be critical particularly of failures to obtain perfection rather i would welcome approximations provided the author knows that they are approximations and knows what science is i would rule out however some approximations where the goal for the author is philosophy persuasion propaganda ethics or the essay i am not adverse to the sociologist writing essays or propaganda providing he does this merely as a human being and not as a scientist when urged to indicate the nature of some of his own contributions ogburn wrote i claim that the problem of social evolution is solved and that i have played a considerable part in solving it by solving i mean solving in the sense that darwin solved the problem of biological evolution darwin did it by pointing out three factors variation natural selection and heredity darwin added the factor of natural selection the problem of social evolution is solved by four factors invention exponential accumulation diffusion and adjustment my contribution has been largely in the factor of exponential accumulation and also in the development of the factor of invention i also think that my role has been significant in the adjustment of one part of culture to another cultural lag there will no doubt be refinements in the analysis and measurements just as there have been in darwins three factors which explain biological evolution one other contribution of mine im rather fond of is the observation verified by measurement that trend lines seldom change their direction very sharply or quickly although the fluctuations about a trend line often do the development of the reasons why trend lines do not change their direction sharply is interesting but this discovery rests upon its significance for planning and for the recognition it gives to social stability although ogburns many contributions have been indicated as in the field of statistical method the influence of technology upon society the family and population he writes that i suppose i would be classed by most of my colleagues as in the field of social change although i dont like to be fenced in and with reference to sociologys great opportunities in the future he wrote i think the greatest opportunity in sociology lies in getting away from bias and prejudice and contributing reliable information you will recall that the idea which you and i had in carrying through together the social trends study was to rule out all opinion unsupported and to accept nothing but reliable conclusions the idea was that as a multiplication table should be reliable both for the tory and the communist so the conclusion of social trends should be valid alike for the radical and the conservative i think the almost universal acceptance of the social trends study was a tribute to a measure of success in making it reliable if we succeed in building up a respect for the reliability of social science among statesmen responsible educators and capable congressmen and among business and social leaders universities and the students will follow one of the biggest hindrances to the attainment is the distorting effect of bias and emotion another practical obstacle to research i have come to think is the prestige which goes to the advisory function in public affairs and the prestige of committee work with agencies such as federal government and the special wartime agencies it is impossible to do research work and committee work in washington at the same time and nowadays sociologists run away from the long hard slow tasks of research for the quicker easier prestige of counseling in public affairs such counselors i call committee bums ogburns presidential address in  was in character when he spoke on the folkways of a scientific sociology in substance it was what he wrote later in the scientific monthly for april  in the past the great names in sociology have been social theorists and social philosophers but this will not be the case in the future for social theory and social philosophy will decline that is in the field of scientific sociology social theory will have no place in a scientific sociology for it is not built upon sufficient data of course certain syntheses of broader researches may be called theory a new meaning for an old term but such syntheses will be based on evidence social theory in good part is the product of wishful thinking
