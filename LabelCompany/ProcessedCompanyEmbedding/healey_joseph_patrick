expects that students will take full advantage of these cocurricular programs our graduates attend the finest colleges in the country and return to become leaders in this community in the upper school liggett students are asked to take ownership of the learning process accept risks and discover a passion for a subject or discipline this step requires trust so beginning in ninth grade we focus on team building and emphasize the studentteacher relationship a recent alumni survey suggests that our strategy is working many of our graduates still recall that moment when a liggett teacher helped unlock a door to discovery in the th and th grade the curriculum concentrates on building mastery of core subjects and our students are asked to do more with the material in english and history students learn to weigh and challenge new ideas and to use essential questions in this examination process in the th grade students begin take more control of their overall program of study and have the opportunity to delve more deeply into the subjects that keep them most engaged that concept  meaningful engagement  is a daily goal we ask students to participate fully in each process and to own their own lives we make this request of our athletes artists and community servants as well practice like you play walk the walk for hunger sing with volume and intensity and have your voice heard at
