television  pittman robert w pittman robert w us media executive robert w pittman was listed in the spring  advertising age special tv th anniversary issue as one of  who made a difference in the history of television known as the father of mtv at  he created the programming for mtvthe music television cable networklaunched in  mtv revitalized the music business and spawned the music video industry which in turn influenced an entire new generation of television programming production and commercials that appealed to the mtv generation of young viewers pittman began his remarkable career at  as a disk jockey in radio in his home town of jackson mississippi from there he went to milwaukee detroit and at  got his first job in programming as the program director of wpezfm in pittsburgh pennsylvania he took the contemporary music formatted radio station to the top of the ratings in its younger target demographics he then moved to chicago and at  programmed country music on nbcowned wmaqam where the station shot up from nd to rd wmaqs success is considered one of the major programming turnaround success stories in radio history pittman duplicated the phenomenal success of wmaqam when he was given the responsibility of programming wmaqs coowned fm station wkqx late in  when he was  in one rating book he beat the longtime albumorientedrock aor leader in the market and made a debut near the top of the target demographic ratings in  nbc sent pittman to new york to program the floundering wnbcam once again the boy wonder as he was known in radio circles led contemporary music and personality formatted wnbc programming to the top of the ratings in its target groups many knowledgeable radio programmers and historians consider pittman to have been the most successful radio program director ever primarily because of his spectacular success in a variety of formats his unusual combination of creative and analytic brilliance made him a rare programmer a researchoriented manager who understood and could deal with the creative talents and egos of people in the music industry disk jockeys and personalities such as don imus whom pittman was instrumental in firing and then rehiring at wnbcam it was this creativeanalytic brilliance that led john lack the executive vice president of warner satellite entertainment company wasec to hire pittman as the programmer for the movie channel in  and give him his first television job although lack had conceived of doing an allmusic channel filled with programs it was pittman who develop the concept of an all video channel where recordcompanyproduced videos would be programmed as records were on a radio station as much as and perhaps more so than the music it was the image the attitude that made mtv not only an instant hit with the antiestablishment antiauthoritarian under audience it targeted the network also their new cultural icon the first network for the under generation designed for them by one of their own from the inception pittmans genius was in positioning mtv to be different from the overtheair traditional networks abc cbs and nbc he hired cuttingedge avant garde production houses to create logos that would be instantaneously recognizable as not network logos as not traditional graphics or symbols or icons and as not the network of any young persons parents he made sure it would be impossible for any young person to click by mtv on a television set and mistake it for any other network or station immediate recognition and a unique look were his goals another facet of pittmans brilliance was his ability to conceptualize programming he postulated a new theory to explain how young people who grew up with television consumed it differently from their parents the older generation he suggested watched tv as they read books in a linear way the new television generation he believed processed tv in a nonlinear manner processing visual information much faster than the older nontv generation processing it nonsequentially nonlinearly without being confused by brief disjointed images from this insight came the distinct style of mtv but programmers are often impractical they often let their creativity run amok and break budgets still another facet of pittmans genius was his business savvy mtv was the first basic cable network to become profitable the record companies paid for the programmingthe videosjust as they gave radio stations their records mtvs programming content was virtually free the combination of business acumen and programming astuteness led to pittmans being named ceo of the mtv networks in  in this capacity he oversaw the redesign and relaunch of nickelodeon the creation of vh and nick at nite the expansion of mtv into global marketseurope australia and japanand the companys  initial public offering on the stock market in  pittman left mtv after an unsuccessful attempt to buy out the network and cofounded quantum media with mca quantum media produced the morton downey show a television talk show and the innovative police documentary the street quantum media was sold to timewarner in  and pittman became an executive assistant to steve ross in  he was named ceo of timewarner enterprises and took over the additional responsibilities of being chief executive of six flags amusement parks majority owned by

july   issue of new york magazine “i have nothing to talk about” robert w pittman says his mississippi drawl in fastforward the words come across the phone as quickly as images on mtv the music network he once ran “i’m in the press too much it looks awful it’s deadly i’ve got nothing going on if there was a reason okay but it’s deadly i’m disturbed my profile is as high as it is i’m afraid to go out” but go out he does with sandy his jackie kennedylookalike wife relentlessly raising that profile even when bob was hobbling on crutches after breaking his hip last year the pittmans hopped from highprofile fashion parties to charity benefits to dinners at punsch working rooms posing for paparazzi and holding court and hold court they should for bob now head of a time warner businessdevelopment unit and sandy a former fashion stylist turned outdoors entrepreneur are the couple of the minute the latest prince and princess of the city they met as two ambitious young arrivals from the sticks and became prototypical young achievers constantly moving with the times they charged into the city’s new society circuit in the late eighties showing off their power style connections achievements and acquisitions at every opportunity now in the nineties friends are describing bob  and sandy  as avatars of the new altruism but they are also symbols of the new defensiveness refusing for instance to be interviewed for this article “it invites sniping” bob explains in our one phone conversation for the record “you know what i’m the luckiest sob ever walked out of mississippi but it’s troubling at a certain point you’d like to get involved but charities think you’re only in it for pr” to be a part of these new quieter dogood times it’s better for them not to be seen promoting themselves anyway they’ve done enough of that already bob pittman came out of mississippi as the quintessential babyboomer boasting that he had the attention span of a flea he also had the slick soul of a marketing genius raised on nothing but rock and television ever since he became a teenage dj in jackson mississippi in  he has played a public role though he never graduated from any of the four colleges he attended in  at  he was named the program director of wnbc radio in new york a few months later he’d parlayed that position into starring roles in the station’s television commercials and on a latenight rock tv show in  pittman married sandy hill  a merchandising editor at mademoiselle magazine three years later as a senior vicepresident of the warner amex satellite entertainment company bob was put in charge of the infant music network mtv “all i worry about is winning” he told the new york times the onetime hippie from mississippi had turned into a fullfledged yuppie in  he was a runnerup to time magazine’s man of the year pete ueberroth the next year sandy started a fashionvideo company and began running charity benefits and bob tried to lead a group of executives in a leveraged buyout of mtv but lost the company to viacom pittman left mtv in  to launch a coventure with mca inc which invested more than  million in quantum mediapittman’s dream of a multifaceted entertainment company for the nineties he wanted to be the youngest brashest turk — the donald trump — of the media kingdom nowadays he is pursuing the same vision at time warner by day and mingling with business entertainment and social stars by night gentleman bob even escorted ivana trump to her car one recent gala night and told wwd how gratified he was by the experience    it’s a good life the pittmans have begun accumulating modern art and have made it onto several highpowered charity and cultural boards from the new york shakespeare festival’s to the coro eastern center’s bob pilots his own plane on his frequent trips to the coast sandy has skied the back bowls at aspen kayaked in the arctic circle trekked in nepal and backpacked in the grand tetons in doing all this the pair have generated newspaper articles and profiles in magazines like esquire gq and hg and enough partypage photos and mentions in gossip columns to line the walls of their central park west apartment their  squarefoot converted barn in connecticut and maybe soon sandy’s compact but impressive twoseat helicopter now sandy is switching into career high gear herself working on what friends describe as an ambitious plan to become the martha stewart of the outdoors “she was saying what do i do with my life’ ” recalls a friend “it was bob’s idea he’s so smart” though there are no deals yet sandy hopes to produce a series of books and videos on adventuretravel topics and maybe even a line of outdoor gear and clothing an obsessively organized woman she’s already at work on publicitya series of articles in mirabella about her active outdoor life all this casts some doubt on pittman’s proclamation about keeping a low profile at isaac mizrahi’s fashion show in april for instance sandy told a fashion editor about her project saying that her first step would probably be a book on mountain climbing “are you sure that’s the kind of climbing you’re writing about” came the reply both friends and detractors describe the pittmans as a perfect match they are ambitious attractive directed and wellspoken to the point of glibness bob is the son of a methodist minister who moved around the state before finally settling in brookhaven mississippi when bob was in junior high he was the ultimate outsidera scrawny church brat who had lost an eye when he was thrown from a horse at the age of six but he was always ambitious “bob always wanted to be rich and famous” his brother tom once recalled “that was clear … he said so” sandy was raised in los gatos in northern california the athletic daughter of a businessman who rented portable toilets “she comes from pretty modest means” says beth rudin dewoody a friend of the couple’s a former conde nast coworker says “to hear her description she comes from a lot of money but in fact her parents are very downtoearth people not at all like her” before she came to new york in the late seventies sandy led outdoor trips went to ucla and worked in retail stores by the time she was spotted by a mademoiselle editor at a bus stop on her way to her first job in new york at bonwit teller she was perfectly packaged when she started as a merchandising editor at mademoiselle she was married to jerry solomon a businessman she’d met in california who is now president of proserve a virginia sports marketing and management company “he’s a player too” says a journalist who covers the tennis scene “he’s very slick he was very successful very young” sandy also seemed groomed for the fast track “she was beautiful” says lisa norris eisner a conde nast coworker “she was smart ambitious and always always clever” “sandy knew how to merchandise herself” says another coworker “she was so clear about what she wanted and she’d aim right for the top she was like a magazine article how to look how your house should look how to have a conversation you’d walk away thinking wow there was a point when she could have gone in a different direction the ambition was just a seedling then” sandy’s employers found that ambition admirable but they too say she may have carried it too far “at that time” says one “conde nast had the illusion of family people who’d been there for years were playing by the old rules she didn’t play the game in that manner” but she was a natural winner a coworker says that even when she and solomon broke up just before christmas  “she came back smelling like a rose” the following january sandy was on her way to los angeles planning to continue on to san francisco to visit her parents when she spotted bob pittman across an airplane aisle she thought he was attractive “i gathered my strategy together as to how to talk to him” she once said she decided he’d be most attracted to her if he saw her reading the new yorker ” ’cause that says a lot about a person” it was love at first sight when their flight was diverted to san francisco they spent the night at her parents’ who were out of town the next day they took a romantic drive down the coast highway to los angeles back in new york bob filled sandy’s apartment with roses they married in july    when they met bob an itinerant radio dj and program director had just moved from wnbc to the new warner amex satellite entertainment company as program director for the movie channel he quickly became a vice president in charge of programming for the movie channel as well as developing various other programs sandy changed jobs too she surprised her mademoiselle bosses when she moved to bride’s as beauty editor “everyone said my god why she’ ” one top editor recalls “it didn’t last very long” when she left to open her own fashion styling and eventplanning business she left behind few admirers coworkers have even formed a loose network over the years one calls it “a sandy pittman hate club” members copy stories about the pittmans send them to one another and “foam at the mouth and rip out our hair” one coworker says on august   mtv the allmusic cable network became a reality if not an overnight success mtv was reportedly losing  million a year in  the next year sandy gave birth to the pittmans’ only child robert thomas who is known as bo and bob was named executive vicepresident and chief operating officer of the warner amex networks that same year mtv ratings rose by  percent by the fourth quarter the network started turning a profit mtv itself was bob pittman’s first major national controversy the question of who created it was the next one many articles have given him sole credit and he has also claimed it “mtv was a pet idea of mine” he told the daily news in  others say mtv was conceived by john lack who hired pittman lack won’t comment “i’m not the guy you want to talk to about bob and sandy pittman” lack says “i’m uncomfortable discussing it” in fact the idea had been floating around for years the  show album tracks with pittman as host featured clips of rockers like kansas and meatloaf and pittman says that at least one allmusic channel was on the air in georgia before mtv but pittman still feels the sting of the controversy and backpedals when discussing the origins of mtv “john lack i love to death” he says “he got me the meeting with then warner chairman steve ross and american express chairman james robinson at the end of the day they’re the ones who should claim credit because they decided to spend the money” still pittman became the unquestioned leader of mtv in  he supervised the revamping of another warner amex product nickelodeon in  he introduced the mellow video station vh and a nickelodeon offshoot nick at nite that same year the company went public and pittman mtv president david horowitz and a group of other executives put together a million bid for the networks viacom gobbled them up in november after pittman’s attempt failed a few days before christmas viacom made him the president and ceo of mtv networks inc but pittman wanted more by may  he’d announced that he was going to resign when he left mtv that fall he had stock options worth more than  millionand a plan backed by mca inc he formed quantum media inc with a mandate to build and buy companies across the entertainment board    sandy hadn’t been resting either after bo’s birth she went back to work in early  the mtv influence was everywhere fashion videos produced by entrepreneurs like christy ferer of vidicom inc had been running for years on local and cable style shows and even on nationally syndicated programs like entertainment tonight with her magazine background and her television husband sandy was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the situation sandy hill pittman productions went into video “she was making her move” a colleague says “sandy had this idea to do what bob had done with mtv and make the same impact” her company biography describes her as “one of the pioneers of fashion videos” but a videoindustry source who knew her in those days describes her as “uppity and presumptuous” help soon came from don ohlmeyer who was best known as the former head of nbc sports more important for the pittmans ohlmeyer had gone on to become an independent tv producer and head of the agency that placed commercials for his backer nabisco when ohlmeyer decided to put nabisco’s commercials on mtv he became one of the new network’s key supporters he also produced mtv’s first video music awards show which was broadcast live from radio city music hall in  “bob and don became friends” says a source in the video business “the next thing you knew ohlmeyer opened a fashionvideo division” after sandy coproduced a swimsuit video with ohlmeyer she shut down her company to become president of in fashion an ohlmeyer division in july  she began making regular men’s women’s and swimwear fashion reports for espn and developing a daily fashion show that november sandy played a major part at two big new york events she connected the nonprofit fashion group with pittman and mtv which not only provided footage and technical and creative support but underwrote a presentation on the music channel and its fashion influence “not too long after that” says the group’s executive director lenore benson “sandy came to talk to me about the possibility of becoming a fashion group production company” it didn’t work out but a fashionshow benefit for live aid bob geldof’s ethiopianrelief organization proved a professional bonanza sandy met and worked with norma kamali who directed a video that sandy coproduced for the benefit and details founder annie flanders who was cochairwoman of the evening with sandy the fashion aid benefit grew out of a dinner conversation that the pittmans had one night with harvey goldsmith a british concert promoter sandy offered to produce an american event simultaneously with one he’d planned for london “she was very lovely sweet and enthusiastic” says someone who helped run the show “but i can’t think of one thing she did” what she did was get her husband interested in details a year later bob pittman offered to buy the magazine as a key piece in his plan for quantum “he wanted to use us to find young talent and give it a chance to be realized” says flanders “he wanted to be in advertising publishing television and give each of them synergy with the others he had this vision of being the major company in young media” but after long negotiations the deal fell through in december     it just wasn’t the couple’s minute yet sandy’s big venture had problems too fashion america was launched in april  as a daily show on both the espn sports and lifetime cable networks during its fastpaced halfhour the show featured fashion videos and runway footage provided by designers just as mtv used programming paid for by record companies interspersed with music videos interviews and style tips “suddenly somehow — stress the irony — sandy became a player” says a journalist who covered video but despite its wide availability and the ministrations of two public relations companies fashion america was not renewed for a second season “she was out of her league” says someone who worked on the show the division fizzled when ohlmeyer moved to los angeles colleagues say she brushed the whole thing off “she’s the type who’s got to succeed” one says “if her business isn’t going well she goes on to something else with tremendous energy rather than trying to salvage it it was clear always that she wanted to travel with the right crowd nouvelle society was just beginning” that became her “something else” she even started looking like a lady who lunched a video executive noted the change at a conference in  “suddenly there was a new sandy behind chanel armor” she says meanwhile it looked like bob had another winner on his hands “i didn’t want to turn  and still be known as mr mtv” he said in  that april quantum media issued its first product a home video of a sugar ray leonardmarvin hagler prizefight a year later quantum had two shows in national syndication on tv the morton downey jr show created the next pittman controversy when the host took his new brand of confrontational television nationwide the street quantum’s second syndicated show was a brave attempt at tvverite — a cop show that used tough street language pittman was proving his success was no fluke but quantum faltered pittman couldn’t assemble the capital he needed to acquire and develop businesses takeover attempts against j walter thompson the nbc radio stations and a televisionstation group called tvx failed quantum’s record company qmi music released only one albumby jimmy davis and junction a memphis bandand the tv division was shaken when downey turned up in the papers with a swastika painted on his face the street went off the air after only  shows killed by a writers’ strike lots of other projects never got out of development and totally hidden video which did make it onto foxtv inspired accusations of plagiarism from candid camera creator allen funt who had previously pitched a movie about himself to quantum’s film division the division was run by two film executives in los angeles mary anne page and daniel rogosin “bob pittman told us he had been tapped to create the universal studios of the nineties encompassing interactive television records and film” rogosin says “there is a difference between what we were told and reality” quantum’s executives seemed indecisive that was because pittman was already talking to his former mentor warner chairman steve ross about coming back home their first discussions were in december  in february  the rumor that pittman was leaving quantum for warner turned up in liz smith’s column nobody said anything to the film executives but suddenly their phones went cold in march they were told the company was closing pittman called page after the separation was a fact “i can get you a job with quincy jones” he said the deal was delayed by the controversy surrounding the merger of time inc and warner but finally last march  the new entity announced that pittman would head its unit for business and strategic development and entrepreneurial ventures “he has a new idea every second” steve ross has said of the young man some think he sees as his heir apparent meanwhile the pittmans were acting like coupleoftheminute contenders sandy told hg she spent a lot of time organizing her and bob’s busy life she arranged lavish parties like an elvis presleytheme halloween do they threw in connecticut guests who’d dressed as the singer and his wife priscilla arrived to find the name elvis spelled out in big letters made of jello and a recordyourvoice trailer parked nearby pr woman susan blond and her husband realestate agent roger erickson were impressed by a smaller scale production “we were macrobiotic so sandy cooked a vegetable dinner herself” blond says “she made eighteen different varieties of mushrooms”    but sandy isn’t just playing house she is also involved with charities that are more socially acceptable than downtown fashion shows for ethiopian relief and there area lot of admirers on that benefit circuit meredith mrs tom brokaw the chairwoman of the coro center’s board says she quickly noted sandy’s intelligence enthusiasm and extensive connections as a board member a participant in toro’s mentor program and a chairwoman of several dinners brokaw says pittman has proved herself “just a really hard worker organized with a lot of energy and a lot of what you look for in leadership” last year brokaw and her daughters traveled with sandy to the himalayas and came away even more impressed “i really admire her spunk and spirit” brokaw says “this was no princess out on a hike” sandy is also very involved with the women’s tour group of the central park conservancy “sandy’s pioneered tours in the north end of the park” says a conservancy staff member “she even helped plan a park luncheon where she served edible park plants she’s really sort of regular she’s really got everything and they’ve made it fast she’s minkandmanure catty comments can result” beth rudin dewoody who met the pittmans two years ago agrees “our agendas have changed” she says “the eighties were the gogo years if sandy is symbolic of the nineties it’s because she’s committed to doing good” a day later dewoody calls back “sandy’s not for sale” she says “she only works for what she truly believes in people like her because she’s full of good ideas and sandy and bob are always supportive of whatever i do they donate money to a lot of charities” bob gives his time too he’s chairman of the board of the new york shakespeare festival and a director of the one to one foundation a group that works with underprivileged children philanthropy and business mix in the latter case pittman was brought into the foundation by raymond chambers an entrepreneur who reportedly just sold a piece of his six flags amusement parks to pittman’s time warner unit “one can’t blame them for getting involved” says ken lerer a partner in robinson lake lerer  montgomery a public relations firm lerer is another former colleague of bob’s “photographers and glitz are baggage that come along with involvement” he continues “i know how much time they spend they ask me for contributions all the time for anybody to criticize that is repugnant when you have pageone stories in the new york times talking about apathy on the rise they shouldn’t be criticized people should say thanks” but that’s not what everyone says when sandy was a cochairwoman of a benefit for gay men’s health crisis to celebrate arista records’ fifteenth anniversary there were many disagreements and hard feelings people involved with the evening are still furious claiming sandy did little after the initial meetings friends say she objected to the way the event was being run critics point out that she was listed in the benefit’s glossy program as contributing  to the evening when in fact she gave only a fraction of thatabout  geoffrey knox a spokesman for gmhc says that the  figure includes cash and “in kind” credit for her professional contributions    “i’m awed and appalled by the intensity of their desire to climb” says a journalist who has known the pittmans since the mtv years roger altman strongly disagrees the yearold vicechairman of the blackstone group got to know pittman when his company backed several of quantum’s acquisition attempts “bob is an ambitious guy but so am i and most people i know” altman says “bob is not differentiated by ambition or hunger actually bob’s kind of laidback” indeed most criticisms are directed at sandy “she gives him a lot of drive” says an exfriend “she sees where to go and she wants to be there a lot of that push is her she sends presents notes it’s so calculated” howard rosenman a film producer in los angeles got such a present after vacationing with the pittmans at the time warner villa in acapulco he and sandy went parasailing together afterward they convinced the very democratic group back at the house that they’d met dan and marilyn quayle and invited them back to the villa for drinks “it escalated into madness” rosenman says “we got so into it we couldn’t get out i asked sandy what are we going to do’” at  just before the quayles were due to arrive a note supposedly from the vicepresident was delivered to the house begging off but inviting pittman and rosenman to the white house “we never let on that it was a joke” rosenman says “sandy then sent me the note framed” rosenman became an unabashed admirer “they’re very unpretentious people” he argues “very refreshingly honest they like successful people but who doesn’t and who isn’t a social climber in new york except some homeless people”  michael gross michael gross biography selected articles contact books house of outrageous fortune unreal estate
