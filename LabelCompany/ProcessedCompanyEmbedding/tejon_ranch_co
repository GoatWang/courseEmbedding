agriculture farming on tejon ranch can be traced to the s when native americans cultivated an area on rancho de castac – one of the original mexican land grants that eventually became part of what tejon ranch is today although sheep and later cattle were the main focus of the ranch in the s records show that vineyards and orchards were planted by the s with  acres of oranges  acres of figs and  acres of vineyards and mixed deciduous trees listed today that tradition continues with about  acres devoted to pistachios almonds alfalfa and winegrapes   stateoftheart farming methods the ranch uses the latest and best farm management practices to minimize the potential environmental effects of farm operations for example tejon ranch works hard to preserve air quality by employing a variety of practices the ranch no longer burns prunings historically a common practice in agriculture instead it took the lead in instituting a noburn policy now when trees are trimmed the trimmings are shredded to make chips which can be reused in a controlled facility to generate electricity several programs are in place to control dust they include growing turf or other natural vegetation between the rows of trees in the orchards to prevent the dust being kicked up particularly during harvest season other programs include good planning of daily trips each day on dirt roads and watering down roads in dustprone areas other practices that help conserve water and energy include capturing stream runoffs and installing stateoftheart drip irrigation systems that rely on gravity whenever possible and require less water an integrated pest management program depends less on pesticides and more on the natural environment to control pests for example owl boxes are located throughout the ranch to attract these migratory birds for nesting and to feed upon pests it’s considered an environmentally sensitive way to manage pest problems vineyardsvineyards and orchards vineyards more than  acres are devoted to vineyards in two locations – the mountain area where warm days and cool nights are ideal conditions for growing premium wines and the valley floor where grapes are grown for generic winesthe tejon vineyards are a prime example of how the ranch takes its stewardship of the land very seriously as a member of california association of winegrape growers the ranch subscribes to “sustainable wine growing practices” a program that illustrates how winegrowers can farm in harmony with the natural environment the goal is to conserve as many natural resources as possiblestateofthe art practices include a pest management program where only a few ounces or grams of treatment compounds are applied per acre not pounds and a very selective drip water system where the water goes directly to the roots where it’s neededother practices ensure the vines are balanced with the right spacing and the soil is managed so there’s no erosion into creeks streams or lakes interesting facts ac orchards ac vineyards ac almonds ac pistachios countries orchards overall the ranch devotes more than  acres to almonds and pistachios several varieties of almonds on about  acres yield the largest crop the almonds typically are harvested in midaugust to october you never know where you’ll find a tejon ranch almond during a recent year almonds from the ranch were shipped to  different countries worldwide approximately  acres are dedicated to pistachios which are harvested in early september pistachios require careful handling as the nuts are already split when they are ready to harvest so they are not allowed to hit the ground they are then sent to a processing facility where they end up either roasted or salted links kern county farm bureau california association of winegrape growers
