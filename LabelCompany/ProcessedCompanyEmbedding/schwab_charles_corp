more about choosing an etf watch the video or read below for answers to the top five questions you should ask before investing in etfs transcript learn more about choosing an etf so youre thinking about investing in an exchangedtraded fund  youve decided on the asset class you want to invest in and you found a few etfs that could be right for your portfolio but how do you know which of those etfs is the right etf for you  start by asking yourself these five important questions about any etf youre considering  lets take them onebyone  first whats the expense ratio  when youre choosing an etf cost is an important factor  the expense ratio is the percentage of fund assets that are deducted every year to cover management fees  check to make sure that your etf has an expense ratio thats low compared to other funds in the same category  question   what will you pay in trade commission  trade commission is the second part of the cost equation  its the fee you pay every time you buy or sell an etf  look for a low commission or no commission at all if possible  question   whats the bidask spread  the bidask spread is another cost  this is the difference between the etfs bid price which is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a share and its ask price which is the price a seller is willing to accept for a share  often the more an etf is traded the smaller the bidask spread and the smaller the bidask spread the more of your money goes to the actual investment which is better for you  look for a spread of just a few pennies question   what are the funds total assets under management  youve considered the cost of your etf  now look at the quality  assets under management refers to the amount of money thats already been invested in the etf  its a pretty good indicator of the funds viability  schwabs experts prefer etfs that have at least  million in assets and preferably much more in general the more assets under management the better question   how do the etfs returns compare to its benchmarks returns  what you want to see is the etfs performance tracking closely to the performance of its benchmark over time  if there are significant differences between the two sets of returns it could mean that youre looking at a potentially riskier investment so those are our five questions  lets see how asking them can help you decide between two similar etfs from the same asset class  well take two hypothetical etfs and ask whats the expense ratio the trade commission the bidask spread what are the assets under management and how well do its returns track to the benchmark  while this is a simple example working through these five questions really can help you see which etf might be a better pick  ready to find the etf thats right for your portfolio  schwabs etf evaluation tools are a great place to start  youll find them at schwabcometftools  and if you need help as you choose the right etf for you just call us at  take the next stepopen an account at

stepped down and gave pottruck sole control as ceo on july   the companys board fired pottruck replacing him with its founder and namesake news of pottrucks removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped  percent to  million for the second quarter driven largely by a  percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading after coming back into control mr schwab conceded that the company had lost touch with our heritage and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors he also rolled back pottruck’s fee hikes the company rebounded and earnings began to turn around in  as did the stock the share price was up as high as  since pottruck’s removal ten times since the return of charles schwab the company’s net transfer assets or assets that come from other firms quadrupled from  to  schwab yieldplus fund this fund was named as one of the decades top ten fund disasters for the s “in written materials and in conversations with customers some schwab representatives omitted or provided incomplete or inaccurate material information relating to the funds characteristics risk and diversification and continued to represent yieldplus as a relatively lowrisk alternative to money market funds and other cash alternative investments that had minimal fluctuations in net asset value nav between sept   and feb   schwab sold over  billion in shares of yieldplus to customers which accounted for approximately  percent of the amount schwab customers invested in ultra shortterm bond funds during this time period schwabs solicited sales of yieldplus totaled approximately  billion approximately  percent of which were to customers  years of age or older schwab collected approximately  million in fees from sales of the fund”  from june  through june  the total return on schwab’s yieldplus fund yieldplus held large amounts of securities backed by illiquid longterm private label mortgages it also held long maturity corporate bonds and trust preferred securities in doing so schwab’s fund violated concentration and illiquidity limits stated in its prospectus and had much more credit and liquidity risk than it disclosed in its sec filings and marketing materials yieldplus’ long term securities including private label mortgage backed securities gave it a slight advantage over its peers prior to  unfortunately the extra yield was an order of magnitude smaller than the losses that followed when credit and liquidity spreads widened and the value of its long term holdings dropped significantly in  and  was  when other ultra short bond funds had little or no losses these large losses occurred because schwab’s yieldplus fund was not an ultra short bond fund as claimed by schwab it was instead an ultra long bond fund yieldplus’s heaviest reported losses occurred in early  yet schwab still appears to have understated these losses by significantly inflating the value of the fund’s holdings and therefore its navthe yieldplus fund made large risky investments in long maturity structured products such as subprime residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” that were inconsistent with the sec’s definition of an ultra short bond fund schwab marketed the fund as a cash equivalent investment and as a safe alternative to money market funds with a higher yield and only slightly more risk such a claim would be incorrect for a typical conventionally managed ultra short bond fund but was especially false when made by schwab on behalf of the yieldplus fund in its marketing materials schwab compared returns on the yieldplus fund to returns on the lehman short us treasury  month index the treasury securities included in the lehman index have no credit risk are highly liquid and have short maturities the holdings of the yieldplus fund generally shared none of these attributes  yieldplus had  billion of investor losses including losses by the founder himself schwab closed the
