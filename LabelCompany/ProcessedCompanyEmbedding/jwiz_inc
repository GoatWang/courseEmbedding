offering we may be required to seek additional sources of capital sooner if · operating assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate · we consummate any acquisitions of significant businesses or assets or · we further accelerate our expansion plans and enter new markets more rapidly the market for providing online marketing solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive and we expect these conditions to persist for the foreseeable future barrierstoentry for large established internet companies are relatively low and current and new competitors can launch new sites and new products at a relatively low cost we believe the principal barriers to entry are the following · acquiring a valuable domain name · building a robust user base and customer base and · financial resources for sales and marketing we currently or potentially could compete with a number of other companies our competitors include the major search engines such as google yahoo bing online directories digital media companies and advertising sites such as yelp angie’s list craig’s list social networking sites such as facebook twitter and snapchat as well as online ecommerce sites trading platforms and communities we also compete with various sites that target the jewish community such as wwwouorg and wwwchabadorg however these sites tend to focus on a single concept or aspect of jewish life – such as dating and marriage the jewish calendar kosher food places of worship etc we are not aware that any of the owners and operators of these sites provides online marketing solutions or has the same focus that we have – to facilitate commercial interactions between local businesses and the jewish community many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources larger user bases and longer operating histories than we do as a result they have a significant competitive advantage over us when it comes to attracting users and customers our ability to compete effectively will ultimately depend on many factors some of which may not be entirely within our control these factors include usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our websites the scope and quality of the products and services offered on our websites our ability to establish and maintain relationships with our customers our reputation and the strength of our brand and financial resources we face significant competition for customers our competition for spending on advertising include online and mobile businesses and traditional media outlets such as television radio and print we believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertiser spending depends upon many factors including the size and composition of our user base our ad targeting capabilities the timing and market acceptance of our advertising services our marketing and selling efforts the return our advertisers receive from our advertising services and our reputation and the strength of our brand as we grow and need to expand our work force we will also experience significant competition for highly skilled personnel including senior management engineers designers and product managers our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add additional highly skilled employees competition for highly skilled personnel is intense particularly in the new york market where we are located and we compete for personnel against online and mobile businesses other companies in the technology industry and traditional media businesses such as television radio and print in addition our ability to compete effectively for highly skilled personnel will depend on our ability to foster a work environment that encourages independence creativity and innovation opportunities to work on challenging meaningful and important projects the reputation and strength of our brand and compensation company description we offer online marketing solutions that enable
