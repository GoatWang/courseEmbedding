the product started when in the early s in a small firm in los angeles col geronimo a dango the founder and inventor of magiclip works as a maintenance engineer he observed mexican delivery boys playing with an engineers tsquare and junked ball bearings the ball bearings when pressed against the tsquare can hold up pieces of paper even without tapes clips or thumb tacks this was a neat trick that took dangos interest and without his knowing brought an overwhelming change in his life born with a curious and inventive mind dango bought the idea and realised that by using the similar technique he could come up with a simple device that could bring great help to office workers in holding up paper works and that was when the magiclip came into being in  dango was later awarded as the balikscientist award issued by former philippine presdient ferdinand marcos though the market in the philippines for his magiclip did not do magic with sheer courage and determination he relentlessly pushed his product and took the risk of putting up his own company the herdan enterprises which later on became herdan corporation which produces a multiple other products using the magiclip concept these included copy holders telephone organizers flip charts desk organizers and holders for negatoscope xrays contact information contact person  mr john qua job title  sales
