linkspress and media visits contact home now available at amazon﻿ ﻿  now available at amazon nov0 release﻿  ﻿supreme justicenow available at amazon monday september  why workthis week’s update is a little late  i would like to say it’s because i’ve been working so hard but the truth is i’ve produced little in the last three days  what i have done is find out that my eyes work better than i thought my teeth are good and my dentist has proclaimed himself a fan of our books and along with 0 other fans i sat outside in the sun on a day with a hundred degree heat index to watch a football game  add all that up and what i learned is that while my health is good i’m not twenty anymore and four hours in scorching heat is harder on me than i would likethat got me to thinking about something i’ve had to explain to more than a few people lately  i spend a lot of time in the mines working  the question i keep getting is “why”the answer is pretty simple life is short and i’m a lot closer to the end than i am the beginning  in a perfect world which this one seldom is i’ve got twenty more years to get out as many stories as i can  between my partner max allan collins and i we have more than enough ideas so now it’s just a race to get those ideas turned into stories while we have timejust this morning in fact thanks to my wife the former english teacher there is another iron in the fire that wasn’t there just twentyfour hours agoi’ve got an obsessive personality no doubt about it and that makes sitting in my office writing on a gorgeous sunny day a lot easier  if you want to learn more about my obsessive personality check out this week’s blog too  anyway my goal for whatever time i have left is another thirty books  whether that’s a lot or a little is for someone else to decide but that’s the number that feels righti came to fulltime writing in my thirties early for some late for some about right for me  still i feel like i got to the party late and there’s some making up to be done  fate of the union the newest novel by collins and me launches on november 0th  it will be our twentythird novel collaboration in what is beginning to feel like a real career  i hope we’re not halfway through the number of books we’ll write together  that would be pretty fucking sweet  i’m working on my draft for number twentyfour now and am over the burnout or whatever it was i was feeling  we’ve had a long haul done okay but we’re having more fun than we ever have and i’m looking forward to what i hope is another thirty booksso what happens if we make that and we’re still kicking  thirty more right﻿wednesday august  a tense standoffso the coffee iv is important to me  every morning i go to a local place and have coffee while i read and chat online with my friends  some mornings though you get lucky and a character or two walks in and adds something to either the current or a future bookthe sunday morning i spent an hour talking to two drunk transvestites was actually very helpful in what was then the first draft of what would become fate of the union  on november 0 when the book is released yay got the plug in for the new book without a lot of pain you’ll meet karma and virginiatoday’s contribution has yet to find a home  since max allan collins and i write political thrillers serial killers and other crime fiction it might be more difficult to work in what i saw today  the restaurant where i have my coffee shares a parking lot with a target pet smart and staples  most mornings i see a flock of gulls who troll the lot looking for cast off fries and buns  this morning i witnessed a most tense standoff when a murder of crows invaded the lot too  there was much cawing and cursing as the two groups squared off over the remnants of a large order of friesmy first impression was that i was seeing an avian version of the jets and sharks but there was no dancing  instead one crow the leader let’s call him luther jangled three small bottles together as he crowed come on you knew it was coming “warriors come out to pllllaaayyy”the gulls unimpressed stood around cawing back as they waited for reinforcements from above  air support something the original warriors was missing showed up quickly  just as i thought they were finally going to engage in some serious combat a car drove through the lot and disrupted the entire walter hill via alfred hitchcock scenario and i was left to wonder what might have been…just when i was getting ready to give them my cyrus speech about not fighting with each other banding together and taking over the entire city for ourselvesmight be a while before that book actually gets written but adding it to the compost heap in my brain of ideas that mixes matches and eventually turns into something even more twisted than crows and gulls acting out warriors in a parking lotman just once i really wanted to be able to say “can you dig it”﻿wednesday august  perfectly pointless updatenot a lot to update this week  sometimes like now it’s pretty quiet here  i have two different books of my own going some projects by others that i’m contributing to and i’m trying to get back to reading for fun too  turns out several of my friends are excellent storytellers who knewthe cool thing about this job unlike most readers i can talk to the author and go “what were you thinking here  how did you come up with that twist  did you know like five characters have first names that start with m”like any good writer i blame the editor for that one  as writers we get fixated on certain things without realizing it and sometimes mark martin mary and a killer whose nickname is masher all end up in the same story without us realizing we’re doing this   it’s not even always just the first letter all the time  watch me when all the women are named tess bess jess and lucretia  okay i haven’t done that but close  naming characters is hard  i can’t just name them george foreman i george foreman ii and so on  so how do we do it  i ask authors all the time  some use phone books and pick a first name from this column and a last name from the other column on a different page  some look for resonance of some sort…nate heller mike hammer jackson seaker had to get one of mine in  some people are good at it and some of us look like we’ve plucked names from jane austen or billy shakespearewhich brings me to the point of this perfectly pointless update…i like cemeteries  names dates stories already written if you know how to look for them  oh man jed and harriet reasoner had a child that only lived to be three  shit  i saw a father and son buried next to each other at arlington national cemetery  they both served  i noticed mostly because they were from iowa but i also saw that dad passed in his eighties and the son in his twenties  the story is partially written alreadymy favorite  thanks for askingmy maternal grandfather is buried quite a walk from the service road of the cemetery where he and his wife lie  along the walk to his grave i always read the headstones  not far from my grandfather is a headstone that when i read it a complete sentence formed in my head  the man’s name is ralph noyes  the sentence  ralph noyes couldn’t make up his mind  kind of reminds me of this updatesee you next week mystery kids﻿wednesday august  what iflast week i talked about one of the big passions in my life storytelling  that was more from the point of view of an audience member  this week i want to talk about storytelling especially writing novels from the other side – creation in particular collaboration  my partner max allan collins and i just spent three hours fleshing out the plot of the novel of which i’ve already started writing the first draftyeah i know sounds weird  the thing is the book was sold on the strength of a vague synopsis and now is the time to start thinking how we’re going to make something sort of ethereal into something really concrete with you know subplots characters pages and stuff  we knew the beginning twelve pages and what we hoped to accomplish by the end  there were just those three or four hundred pesky pages in the middle to deal with  which by the time we were done plotting also changed the end of the book but that’s one of those things that happens along the way too  at some point i may well find out the first twelve pages were wrong too  at least we have a planlike former heavyweight boxing champion mike tyson once said “everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face”at some point this book will punch us in the face  they always do  i would in fact be worried if it didn’t  the characters need to do what they need to do not what we want them to do  if the characters don’t come alive for us they will never come alive for the reader  as a writer you really want the characters to come alive for the reader it’s the oxygen of fictional lives  here’s the rub though  when the characters come alive for us they’re just as likely to screw up our plan as they are to follow it  when they finally do something that totally punches us in the face that’s when we know we’re on the right track  that moment is when whatever book we’re working on actually starts to feel like a bookso we knew the beginning the ending and we needed to fill in the middle  how do we do that  we play “what if”  what if so and so does this…what if they do that  back and forth feeding off each other as we spitball ideas back and forthal says “we need to do this”“yeah” i say “but we can’t do it there this other thing will set that in motion so what you’re proposing needs to go here instead of there”“but what if we…”and back and forth we go killing people organizing shootouts at national monuments plotting to wreak some pretty serious havoc on some pretty important shit  all the time this is happening we’re sitting in a booth in the back of his hometown applebee’s one eye cocked toward the door in case the swat team comes blowing in because a customer overheard us talking about assassinating supreme court justices we already did that book and called you know what will happen when the swat team swarms in  i’ll be taking notes and even as one of them cuffs me i’ll be asking him “yeah but what if…”wednesday august  art for art’s sakei don’t think of myself as an artist much  i realize i work in the arts but as long as i’ve been a professional writer i considered it a job  a great job the best job there is i think but i tend to bring a lunch pail mentality to what i do  so the idea of art and how important it is in the lives of my wife and mine hasn’t been something i’ve devoted a lot of thought to until recentlymaybe because i’m a little older maybe because i’m simply paying more attention i have noticed how much art and in particular storytelling are to us  just spinning around in my chair in my office i realize there are several hundred books in this room alone not to mention cds and dvds all of them telling some kind of story  the whole house looks like this like it’s insulated with art instead of that pink stuff  i say this not to brag because honestly i’m two kingsize avengers issues away from having a twopart episode on hoardersi bring this up because over the last couple weeks storytelling has been on my mind a lot  there are so many ways to tell a story in this world we’re not just painting mammoths on walls anymore mystery kids that i’m always impressed when someone finds a way to bowl me over with their ability to tell a storywe have seen two very different types of stories that have impressed me lately  the first was a film mr holmes  directed by bill condon written for the screen by jeffrey hatcher adapted from a novel by mitch cullin and featuring sherlock holmes created by sir arthur conan doyle this film has a writer’s family tree that goes back to the nineteenth century but it feels as fresh as today  of the bajillionty eleven holmes stories i’ve encountered since childhood i don’t remember one that dealt with holmes after dr watson made him famous  in this film a ninetythree year old holmes tries to solve his last case from years ago the one that forced him into selfimposed exile  with the help of a boy holmes puts together the pieces even as he battles memoryloss and his own frailty  we loved it and i hope sir ian mckellan receives the academy award for what i thought was an absolutely brilliant performance  nothing explodes there’s no nudity gunfire dumb jokes superheroes or stan lee cameos  it is instead a quiet story told quietly and with patience   while i dug antman and can’t seem to take guardians of the galaxy off its permanent loop in my dvd player this small movie moved me like few stories have latelywhich brings me to something decidedly nonquiet  quite fucking loud in fact – sonic highways  dave grohl’s eight part hbo series that is part documentary about the recording of the new foo fighters album of the same name and part musical history doc about the eight different cities and studios in which the album was recorded  having already seen grohl’s previous documentary sound city i already knew he was a gifted filmmaker  i’ve always liked the band too   the thing is grohl is a storyteller  he does it in song he does it on film  yeah it wanders off track now and then  yeah it gets a little sentimental at the end i don’t care  it works as a way to tell multiple stories that are really all part of a bigger storyi have used this space before to quote my friend the noted children’s author david r collins  going to do it again  david said “my job is to educate and entertain”as a writer i took that to heart but since i write for adults i reverse the order  with sonic highways grohl has found a very admirable balance between the twoi’m reminded of another of my favorite quotes this one from 0 minutes creator and producer don hewitt  when asked to explain the success of the at the time twenty year old show hewitt said “everything we’ve done is based on four simple words tell me a story”i’ve worked both sides of that fence and those four words mean the world to me – tell me a storywhat’s yours﻿ wednesday july  writers conferencesfriend or foewriters sometimes ask me if i think there is any benefit from attending a writers conference  having just returned from the midwest writers workshop my favorite conference i can say unequivocally yes  if you’re just beginning your journey already on the path or even like me nearly thirty years removed from my first conference there’s something there for all of us  it’s kind of like going to church really  sometimes your faith just needs to be renewedmy first one back in  a weeklong event known as the mississippi valley writers conference left me drained after five days of classes that ran from  am until  pm  although i was lucky enough to win a couple of awards i went home wondering if i had really learned anything  my brain cramped from all the information i’d received  fast forward a couple of weeks and i wrote a sentence that i instantly realized i wouldn’t have been able to construct before the conference  slowly it became clear that i had learned tons of stuff and it all became part of my writer’s toolbox  from then on i was hookedin 0 r karl largent a mentor of mine my second father and my partner in robin vincent publishing said “if you’re serious about writing you need to go to more conferences different conferences”  the next year i joined him at midwest writers workshop and that has been my writing home for the last quarter century  i grew up there learned my craft met some of the most important people in my life and eventually became the sponsor of the manny awards mww’s annual writing contesti can’t tell you what all i’ve learned at conferences hell i don’t even know the complete list  a lot of writing but a lot of how to live the writer’s life too  so this year when i attended classes taught by this year’s faculty i went in as someone who isn’t an amateur a twentythree year pro in fact and yet these amazing authors still managed to show me new ways to look at our craft our jobs our careers and sharknado  oh hell no to bootif you’re a fledgling or a pro a poet a novelist or nonfiction writer whatever the hell it is you do in this huge universe of writing can you get better by attending a conference  yeah you canthere are plenty of choices and i’m not naming names beyond mww but you can find them easy enough  there are plenty of eager talented teachers willing to help you so…go for it  join usmy next conference is bouchercon the world’s biggest traveling mystery conference that will be held in raleigh nc this year  that’s not only about education but about seeing my friends  always a good time  i’ll also be at murder  mayhem in milwaukee on november th where i’ll be moderating a panel and damn sure to be asking the panelists about how they do that voodoo they do so well  i won’t be asking just for the audience either  i can learn from my fellow pros and i intend tonext july though i’ll be back at the midwest writers workshop in muncie in  by then i’ll need some churchin’ up  because let’s face it we can all use a little more knowledge and a little more faith right﻿ new release family values short storyfriday march  its all about collaborationone of the questions i’m most frequently asked is why do i collaborate with another writer  my stock answer is because i like working with other writers and when it comes to my main partner max allan collins we work well together the real answer is that any book read by more than its own author is a collaboration  the author tries to paint a word picture that will allow a reader with a completely different set of life experiences to “see” the same movie that is playing in the author’s head  how much control the author cedes to the reader to fill in the picture determines the depth of the collaboration while i normally think too much about this stuff anyway it really hit home with me when the former english teacher and i went to see crosby stills and nash a couple of nights ago  here are three singers who have been successful alone and in other bands but keep coming back to each other  when these three men harmonize something takes place that doesn’t happen just because talented singers are working together this is a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts  i like to think that’s what happens when collins and i approach a new project  we harmonize and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts before you start thinking that my ego is writing checks my talent can’t cash i’m not trying to say that our talent is on the level of csn all i’m saying is that we harmonize well and more importantly as i discovered with crosby stills and nash it’s not just about the old days  new ideas are being pursued and the experience of having worked together for so long allows them to bring a matured version of their magic to new things  while the creative process never gets easier collins and i have worked together long enough that i believe certain steps in the process are smoother because of experience  after twentysome books and another dozen and a half short stories as well as projects across almost every media platform we have learned each other’s strengths  this allows me to step out of the spotlight and let collins solo where i know he is particularly strong and vice versathe thing that happens when we write together is that a voice that is neither al nor me steps forward  readers especially our friends will tell us they can recognize passages that one or the other of us has written  almost every single time they are wrong  the truth is most of the time neither one of us knows whose stuff is whose  i might have had the thought in some sentence but after al’s pass the words are different  the grain of the thought might be mine but it has been filtered through him and it becomes ours  the process works in reverse too consequently by the end of a book we have both written every sentence and rarely is there one that is entirely his or mine  we harmonize with any luck we’ll get to keep harmonizing on two dozen more novelsmonday february 0 im baaaaackbeen quiet for a while the holidays and this winter combined to put me in a serious funk but im back in the world now and back to workon a sunnier front supreme justice the latest collaboration by max allan collins and myself will be published

we’re  overall in the kindle store  in women sleuths after topping out this weekend in the top twenty and we are still number two in serial killers  i’m happy this book is maintaining traction because al and i have already been discussing how cool it would be to do a sequel and get to hang out with jordan rivera a while longer  the woman is damaged goods but i love hernext up the worlds of edgar rice burroughs sort of sneaked out without us being aware of it  al and i have a short story based on mr burroughs’ mucker stories  billy byrne the mucker isn’t as well known as erb’s other heroes tarzan and john carter of mars but he was the perfect fit in the historical crime world where we spend so much of our time  as is usual with us in these historically set short stories real people occasionally turn up  in this story “the two billys” the guest star is new york underworld character legs diamond and while jake orgen doesn’t appear on stage his reallife gang “the little augies” also turns upgiven the changes in the language that have occurred since erb was writing we stayed as close to his style as we could and certainly did our best to maintain the integrity of his characters  we had a great time writing this and having never read burroughs before i found a new author whose work is topnotch and entertaining  we’re proud of this story so please if you’re a fan of burroughs or al and i give this book a look  there are some other great authors included and the collection is getting great reviews on amazon on the mining side working both at once now  working on a nonfiction book about an iowa man who stumbled into becoming a spy during the cuban revolution that vaulted fidel castro to power  in the fiction mines i’ m still trying to find time to complete my first ya novel   is already shaping up to be a busy year  should be fun  until next week monday november  writing isnt about graduatingone of my favorite days is senior day at the university of iowa  this saturday every senior football player will be introduced individually and run out to hug their parents at midfield  if tradition holds and im sure it will i will cry  regardless of the level of their contribution these kids have accomplished something and that always makes me sentimentalthat class structure holds true from elementary school throughout life at least for me  ive been a professional writer for  years yet i still feel like the geeky sophomore admiring the cool kids from afar  it is what it is and i know im not the only author who feels this waymaybe next year will be different  at the very least my schedule seems to be busier  every year i return to the midwest writers workshop because that has become my home those people my family  but in addition ive been invited to speak at love is murder murder and mayhem in muskego and will attend magna cum murder where my brotherinwriting john gilstrap will be the guest of honori know ill never feel like a senior and probably never more than the geeky sophomore but thats cool  writing isnt about graduating its about the journey  next year it just looks like there will be more field trips  if im lucky ill see you at one of these events  maybe our journeys will intersect and that would be cool toofor a bunch of people who think about murder and mayhem so much were a closeknit bunch we geeky sophomores  we love each other we support each other and we are our own tribe and yeah that makes me cry too monday november  history shows uslet’s talk about the economic downturn affordable health care gun control school and mall shootings and every other thing that makes this particular time in history seem like we’re swirling toward the drain  wait  don’t stop reading because you think i’m going to go off on some political screed  truth is we’re going to avoid all those topics because when society is faced with these trying times that’s what we do  we crave escapismhistory shows us thatthere was more than one reason movie theaters were so crowded during the great depression  one was practical few people had air conditioners and in the summer they flocked to the air conditioned theaters simply to cool off  but a big reason was escapismit wasn’t dramas that crowds flocked to see it waswait for itmusicals  okay monster movies and comedies did really well then too point taken  even a casual perusal of top ten grossing movies during those years show titles like frankenstein king kong top hat nd street city lights and it happened one night  longing for a way to not think about their own troubles theater goers looked to fantasy of whatever stripe to carry them away like calgonwhy am i bringing this up nowbecause as someone in the entertainment business i know it sounds pretentious but it’s true i try to pay attention to trends  it seems at least to me that escapism is reigning  fantasyscience fiction seems to be everywheremovies tv games books  that’s all well and good by the way  i’m lining up for this stuff with everyone else  firefly the marvel universe star trek sleepy hollow you name it and you’ll probably find me squarely on the bandwagonthe closest i have come to this particular animal is when max allan collins and i were doing the three novels based on dark angel the jessica alba vehicle set in futuristic seattle  they were fun to write and have generated over the years more fan mail than anything else we’ve done including the ton of stuff we did for csiescapism is as cool now as it was in the thirties  we survived the great depression and i’m betting we’re going to survive all the crap going on in the world now  it’s nice to know we can be entertained along the way  hell maybe it’s time i wrote that science fiction novel i’ve never dreamed of writing  yetmonday november  let’s talk about arti am pretty nonjudgmental when it comes to art  i hear people say this movie sucks or that album blows and i can’t help but think that it’s just art you don’t like why does it have to “suck”likewise critics have become snarkier hateful even  which brings me to what i really want to talk about “the ghost brothers of darkland county” the musical by stephen king and john mellencamp  we got to see it recently  reviews i read beforehand wereunenthused one of them going on about how much he didn’t like it to the point of belittling the cast the creators and even the stagehands  i mean really the lighting techs it was against this backdrop that i prepared to see a play i had been looking forward to  conceivably my expectations were lowered but for the most part i try to ignore reviewshaving put myself out there i understand how reviews sometimes say more about the reviewer than they do the subject being reviewed  that said this play will probably not be winning a tony anytime soon  but does that matter  i enjoyed the music bruce greenwood star trek reboot led a fine cast and the lighting for the most part seemed to light well the stagethere was some internet scuttlebutt that a lot of changes had been made to the original creation that’s the part that fascinates me actually  what was this thing before it morphed into prairie home companion’s darker cousin  i am as curious about the creative process as i am the product that is createdthough i never refer to myself as an artist i am  i live in a space where creation of “something” out of “nothing” is a way of life  so i’m always curious how others who practice this particular brand of voodoo do their voodoo  there are things i really enjoy about the work of each of the artists involved in the creation of “ghost brothers”  that said their marriage doesn’t seem on the face of it a natural one  as a collaborator myself i find myself wondering about the give and take of this creative processi have convinced myself that they were trying to come up with something atypical of your usual stage musical  in that regard i believe they have succeeded  this was unlike any other musical play i have ever seen  whether i left with the message king and mellencamp wanted to send i’m not so sure  but i did come out of it having had a positive experience and now days later their art is still rattling around in my head making me thinkreconsider  and after all isn’t that part of what art is supposed to doon the update side i’ll be stopping by mystery cat books  nd st dr se cedar rapids iowa 0 tomorrow night for the conversation between mystery authors ed gorman barbara collins and my writing partner max allan collins  i think the show starts about sevenor eightmath is not my strong suit but if you’re free stop byshould be fun monday october  the truthwhen i first set up this site i promised something different while it’s easy to peddle my stuff give progress updates on new projects and pimp the books of my friends but that seems a bit too easy so let’s try something differentcomplete honesty the genesis for this particular update comes from several friends of mine recently expressing their own feelings about doubt and its crippling effects also i’ve committed to writing fifty thousand words in the next month i’ve probably written that many words in a month before i have no idea but i know when max allan collins and i were doing the csi books and ancillary materials we were turning product out every ninety days so maybe i’ve written that much in a month before but right now that seems a daunting task why first because i’m a slacker not a happy admission granted but the truth given the choice between pushing myself to be the best i can be or merely being good enough i have until now chosen the latter if the choice is between the hard road and the easy one i have always chosen the easier path even that is a secondary confession though the major reason for allowing my slacker self to prosper is that i’m a coward in a business that rewards perseverance and bravery i have been at least a little successful yet stilldoubt lingers collaboration though it comes with its own inherent set of pitfalls has always been an easier path sitting safely in the home of collaboration i have been able to be published but without the risk of failure being entirely on me though i cherish my collaborators and the collaborations we’ve created it’s time for me to say fuck that and stand on my own two feet which is where doubt comes in do i suck on my own am i the talentless hack that doubt tells me i am for a long time i thought i was the only one who had these thoughts but talking to other writers some wildly more successful than me i have come to understand that doubt is the boogeyman for a lot of us the true monster under the bed doubt and it’s not just fear of failure it’s also fear of success with success comes expectations and sooner or later we will all fail to meet expectations either those of others or in my case my own that particular sting comes more often than i would care to admit even when i’m trying to be completely honest so all of that being said fuck the easy road it’s time to try to carve out a space for myself in this world success matters less than effort on this goround because truly i have no idea what i would consider success at this point my partner max allan collins and i just put the finishing touches on our twentysecond novel together that means merely getting something of my own published won’t cut it sales figures have never meant a lot to me either they are a testament that people are reading our stories and they will hopefully allow me to continue to write fulltime but beyond that i don’t care i don’t read reviews anymore because those are a whole separate mine field so what is success no idea but i’m inviting you to accompany me on this journey as we try and find out ought to be a hell of a trip and doubt yeah he’ll be making the trip tooright by my side i can’t kill it it’s ten foot tall and bulletproof maybe though it can be herded after all keep your friends close and your enemies closer right  monday october  for the first time im working on two projects concurrently  but working on a nonfiction book set during the cuban revolution in the 0s and a present day amateur detective story means there is enough separation in subjects to make this possible as i think about these two vastly different times and plots it has become clear to me that they share certain thematic qualities that makes writing them concurrently not only possible but maybe even desirable family plays a large part in the motivation of both protagonists as does betrayal  while one is motivated mostly by patriotism protecting his family during tumultuous times is also a prime motivator for his actions  the amateur detective is motivated to protect his family as well  the difference being the nonfiction protagonist is concerned about his immediate family while our fictional hero attempts to protect a family that is moreconstructed sort of an extended adopted group while considering these different sets of people back in reallifeland i have been observing the differences in my own extended family  my wife comes from the merging of two large families consequently she has over one hundred first cousinsno exaggeration  they are a closeknit bunch several of the cousins having been raised practically as siblings my own family is a far different matter  my nuclear family consisted of my parents and me  they’re both gone now have been for a while and my family now resembles that of jackson seaker the protagonist of my amateur detective story  his mother has passed and his father spends a lot of time at his job as a police detective  consequently jackson’s family has  become a construction of his friends and their parents  my own family the gravediggers are those people who mean the most to me  none of them is a blood relative but they are my family and the love i feel and thus the love jackson feels for his extended family is no less real our family name comes from the old joke a friend will help you move a good friend will help you move the body  these are the gravediggers  you can tell who we are we all carry a shovel  okay a metaphorical shovel the truth is looking back a lot of the projects i’ve been involved in concern family or the search for family  maybe this theme runs a little deeper than just the current projects  the dark angel books were a series about family in its way and what doesn’t kill her is about an adopted and somewhat damaged family they come in all shapes and sizes and they have all been on my mind lately  looking  forward to digging into this deeper as these projects progress  in the meantime hug your family  seeya next week  settling into the new digs0 i moved into this electronic home a few weeks ago but like any move everything has not gone exactly as i had hoped the idea was that every monday there would be something new on this page and our little five word sentence exercise would change every monday as well obviously sort of screwed the pooch on that bouchercon and the latest deadline conspired to put me in a time crunch that felt like a lucious lars
