and l engines these airtoair aspirated engines deliver a power bulge above rated power to provide excellent torque in demanding applicationskey features series turbochargers pss only variable geometry turbocharger vgt airtoair after cooling highpressure common rail hpcr fuel system engine control unit ecu powertech psspvs engine identification   after treatment s – exhaust filter and selective catalytic reduction scr x – exhaust filter turbocharger v – vgt s – series turbochargers w – wastegate turbocharger technology p – powertech plus e – powertech e powertech pss l engine benefits a constant power range of  rpm down to  rpm power bulge of  percent greater tractor productivity responsive power reducing the need to downshift the transmission details to match the engine power characteristics and improve the operation economy of the machine the rated engine speed is  rpmseries turbochargers overview the powertech pss l and l engines utilize two turbochargers – a vgt and a fixed geometry turbocharger this provides the torque rise and engine response needed to meet varying load conditions fresh air is first drawn into the lowpressure fixed geometry turbocharger and compressed to a higher pressure the compressed higher pressure air is then drawn into the highpressure vgt where the air is further compressed by splitting the work between two turbochargers both can operate at peak efficiency and at slower rotating speeds powertech pss engine series turbochargers benefits deliver highpower density more lowspeed torque and responsiveness to meet varying load conditions vgt overviewthe vgt is electronically controlled and actuates the turbo vanes as required to maintain peak engine performance powertech pvs l engines only have a vgt turbochargerthe turbocharger’s vanes are in the exhaust flow the opening or closing of the vanes changes the outlet volume and airflow speed against the turbocharger turbine when exhaust flow is low the vanes are partially closed this partial closure increases the pressure against the turbine blades to make the turbocharger spin faster and generate more boost pressurethe ability to keep the airflow at optimum levels provides more consistent engine boost pressure and the ability to respond to load quickly across the entire engine rpm range this system is without the turbo lag that can be found on some engines powertech vgt benefits increased low rpm torque  quicker response to load increased peak torque improved fluid economy improved performance at high altitudes airtoair after cooling overviewairtoair after cooling lowers the intake manifold air temperature and provides more efficient cooling while reducing cylinder firing pressure and temperatures for greater engine reliability since lower temperature air is denser a higher volume of air flows into cylinders so the engine is capable of meeting the increasing horsepower demands lowering the intake manifold and cylinder temperatures also aids in lowering the combustion temperature which lowers the nox produced as a result benefits higher horsepower less nox production hpcr fuel injection system overviewevery powertech pss l and l engine utilizes a hpcr fuel system to efficiently supply fuel to injectors the highpressure fuel pump instantly responds to requirements for more or less fuel flow or pressure this electronically controlled highpressure pump delivers pressure on demand according to the application requirements pressure on demand ensures an efficient injection system resulting in highinjection pressure independent of engine speed highpressure common rail benefits instantly respond to load changes reducing the need to change gears improved fluid economy engine control unit ecuoverviewthe ecu uses signal inputs from sensors and preprogrammed performance modeling to control critical engine functions such as fuel quantity injection timing airtofuel ratio multiple fuel injections amount of cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr and a host of other control parameters ecu benefits optimized fluid economy maximum engine performance detailseach injector is controlled individually by the ecu the ecu turns the injector on and off during each firing cycle to control the fuel delivery into each cylinder load and speed sensing allows each cylinder’s fuel delivery rate to be adjusted independently at the individual injector with each injection cycle the ecu can make the following adjustments on the go number of injections fuel pressure in the common rail start of injection duration of injection this management system is connected to the transmission allowing the engine and transmission to respond simultaneously cold weather and highaltitude compensation are also precisely controlled for quality starts regardless of weather and maximum performance at high elevations the ecu also features improved diagnostic capabilities it is faster has more working memory and is responsible for monitoring and executing all aspects of the integrated emission control system pressureandflow compensated pfc hydraulic system overview m pfc hydraulic system the m

measurements for all m models mmin     final tier  ft cab and oos models models m – m m – m m – m wheelbase mm    wheelbase in    benefits this unique solution achieves higher payloads without increasing tractor weight thus increasing productivity the engine is separated from the fullframe design using rubber bushings this method reduces the noise and vibration from the engine ultimately improving tractor uptime and operator comfort full frame carries the load while the powertrain transmits engine power to the final drive this reduces stress on mechanical components thus improving uptime and reducing costs of operation  higher power density is delivered by separating the load carrying components from the power transmitting components allowing optimized designs and operator performance loader brackets mounted directly to the full frame therefore loader forces are not transmitted to the engine or transmission improved serviceability frame mounting allows easier component accessibility without disturbing other systems complete modular component replacement such as transmission and engine is achieved without splitting the tractor in half cab packages and accessories
