loving memory of merv corning merv passed away on september th  we’ll miss him creator of esterline’s heritage of the air collection of wwi aviation paintings merv has been making realist art on a range of subjects close to his heart from airplanes to automobiles landscapes to portraits since  “my dad and uncle owned a waco opencockpit biplane and flying about in that airplane at the tender age of eight left an indelible impression indeed i’ve flown many hours since those less complicated times in all kinds of aircraft but nothing will ever match the thrill of lifting off in that waco i remember the sound of wind in wire the hot fuel and oil smells the clattering engine noise and the lurching swooping sometime weightless feeling of flight” corning has the gift of translating his feeling for his subject into paint “my goal …is the marriage of the airplane authentic in every detail with the rich sometimes scarred landscapes over which these young warriors flew i place the viewer in the air beside these beautiful ancient machines to experience the sensation of flight…” in addition to the  watercolors of heroic wwi pilots and planes he originally painted for leach international now a subsidiary of esterline corporation corning is equally well known for his portraits of players commissioned by the national football league as recently as  he was presented the r g
