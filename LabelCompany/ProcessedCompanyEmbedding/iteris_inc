vantage iteris’ first commercial vehicle detection product to address the intelligent transportation systems its market in the late s iteris acquired the transportation systems business of rockwell international corp meyer mohaddes associates a premier traffic engineering and its consulting firm based in los angeles and certain assets of the washington dcbased consulting firm of viggen corporation to enhance our product engineering and its consulting practices  at the same time iteris developed and went into production with the world’s first commercially available lane departure warning ldw system which was soon deployed on commercial trucks in europe and the us within four years the first passenger cars to offer ldw became available in the us  iteris continued to mature alongside the its industry since the early s and has emerged as a flourishing company with distinguished products and services that have resulted in national projects and awards  in  iteris divested its lane departure product group to focus and transform into an intelligent traffic management information company later that year we established the iperform group to develop and market software
