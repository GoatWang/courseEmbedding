area fits av receiver gaming consoles and dvdbluray players perfectly as others have noted the drawers are not tall enough to hold dvd cases so the spines can be read shipped in two wellpacked boxes assembles in  hour or less with a power driver really brings the room togethergreat tv standi originally purchased this media stand and it looked so great i purchased the stratford media cabinet very elegant furnituremid century stylethis media cabinet is very easy to put together and looks beautiful works with a contemporary or transitional setting its goi g next to a contemporary pool table so i know it will look fantasticperfect heighti needed a media cabinet that was substantial enough to present a  screen although i had some difficulty putting it together the end result was greatthe jetsonsi love this cabinet  it is perfect for me it reminded me of the jetsons cartoon and i love that stylefinest media center ive had the joy to assemblefirst and foremost i received the package in one business day the package is not  lbs as stated in the ups tracking matter of fact its  lbs gross weight  lbs net weight box measures  x  x   these info lifted straight from the box you will definitely need two people to lug this box around for my situation its just my wife and i and we live on a second floor condo we had to take the individual pieces out of the box and transport them upstairs to our home stairs no elevator  this took us about  minutes of back and forth transporting so be forewarned secondly the assembly is straight forward i have to admit its more involved than other assembly project ive partook in but you know what its not that hard the instructions are pretty clear although its strictly drawings with minimal written information this could be a problem for the inexperienced diyer but then again ive read reviews from selfproclaimed experienced diyer who pride themselves in building things with ease and have had problems with assembling this unit sometime taking between  hours to build i couldnt believe it so i timed myself from start to finish on a stopwatch it took only myself a total of  hour and  minutes  seconds to assemble with a power drill wife was busy watching big bang theory in the background clearly if it takes you more than  hours to assemble let alone two people and  hours and still got it wrong youre not as experienced as youd like to think you are the media center requires that you glue wooden dowels into their sockets for maximum installation security  it is not indication of cheaply made material the package includes two tubes of wood glue which is basically elmers glue i ended up using both tubes and had to resort to the elmers glue in my craft cabinet dont waste your time preassembling before gluing and tightening all the hardware as another reviewer recommended just take your time and follow the instructions carefully and youll be fine some reviewers claim the instructions are wrong after halfway i have to disagree and interject that they are the one who are wrong and probably cannot follow instructions be sure to let the fully assembled media center sit for  hours so the gluedin dowels can fully dry after all is set and done this media center is very study very contemporary and stylish our  plasma flat screen is mounted on the wall so clearance is not an issue for us only the center housing have two holes to route your wires through  and for newer allinone entertainment system thats all you really need for example our bluray player is also a  wireless home theater system we got the white and cappuccino model and it compliments our living rooms color scheme perfectly we placed home accent decors bronze sea turtle statue and   vase on each raised side shelf and the final piece commands attention the drawers allow us to stash our books and video game console controllers neatly away affording an uncluttered media center that is quite a contrast to the one this replaced one of the finer investment weve made all thanks to ocoeasy to assemblei was able to assemble this in  hours alone the instructions were very clear the product looks exactly as pictured except that theres more space between the edge of the cabinet and bottom piece when the cabinets are closed i am very pleased with the media consule overall and would definitely purchase this brand againterrific valuethis is a high quality piece it is real wood excellent finish very sturdy and well designed the doors are made of the same solid ash wood with the fronts painted a light metallic gray close to a satin silver  rather than beige as the the picture reflects on my device  very nice the styling is slightly industrial and retro it comes well packaged and protected no dings scratches missing parts or other problems the assembly directions are detailed and understandable the only reason i didnt give  stars is that when the center support leg is screwed all the way in its at least an inch shorter than the other legs unscrewing it to add length would decrease this legs function as a good support for the center of the cabinet we dont have a lot of weight on or in it so its not a problem for us but does seem like a design flaw we use it as a media center below our wall mounted tv and are very extremely pleased with the purchasebeautiful multipurpose mediadisplay cabinetthis is a beautiful piece of furniture to add to any room its not just some pressboard that looks nice but instead a very heavy gorgeous cherry wood with glass paneled windows we bought this for our  inch tv as a stand and the inside will have all of our other media components inside i just love thissponsored linkswhats this red remove restriction media cabinets remove restrictionclear allquick viewsale ends in  daysfavoritesale was

the science of the creative process and how to harness your brain’s power to come up with more great ideas image flickr user folkert gorterby belle beth cooper minute readah ideas who doesn’t want more great ideas i know i doadvertisementi usually think about ideas as being magical and hard to produce i expect them to just show up without me cultivating them and i often get frustrated when they don’t show up when i need themthe good news is that it turns out cultivating ideas is a process and one that we can practice to produce more and hopefully better ideas on the other hand often times great ideas can also just come to us whilst in the shower or in another relaxing environmentfirst let’s look at the science of the creative processhow our brains work creativelyso far science hasn’t really determined exactly what happens in our brains during the creative process since it really combines a whole bunch of different brain processes and contrary to popular belief it includes both sides of our brains working together rather than just one or the otherthe truth is our brain hemispheres are inextricably connected the two sides of our brains are simply distinguished by their different processing stylesthe idea that people can be “right brain thinkers” or “left brain thinkers” is actually a myth that i’ve debunked beforeadvertisement the origins of this common myth came from some s research on patients whose corpus callosum the band of neural fibers that connect the hemispheres had been cut as a lastresort treatment for epilepsy this removed the natural process of crosshemisphere communication and allowed scientists to conduct experiments on how each hemisphere worked in isolation unless you’ve had this procedure yourself or had half of your brain removed you’re not right or left brained we do have a rough idea of how these processes might work thoughthe three areas of the brain that are used for creative thinkingamong all the networks and specific centers in our brains there are three that are known for being used in creative thinkingthe attentional control network helps us with laser focus on a particular task it’s the one that we activate when we need to concentrate on complicated problems or pay attention to a task like reading or listening to a talkthe imagination network as you might have guessed is used for things like imagining future scenarios and remembering things that happened in the past this network helps us to construct mental images when we’re engaged in these activitiesthe attentional flexibility network has the important role of monitoring what’s going on around us as well as inside our brains and switching between the imagination network and attentional control for usadvertisementyou can see the attentional control network in green and the imagination network in red in the image below a recent review by rex junge and colleagues explained what they think might be happening in our brains when we get creative it generally involves reducing activation of the attentional control network reducing this partially helps us to allow inspiration in and new ideas to form the second part is increasing the activation of the imagination and attentional flexibility networksresearch on jazz musicians and rappers who were improvising creative work on the spot showed that when they enter that coveted flow state of creativity their brains were exhibiting these signsproducing new ideas is a process the production of ideas is just as definite a process as the production of fords —james webb young in his book a technique for producing ideas james webb young explains that while the process for producing new ideas is simple enough to explain “it actually requires the hardest kind of intellectual work to follow so that not all who accept it use it”he also explains that working out where to find ideas is not the solution to finding more of them but rather we need to train our minds in the process of producing new ideas naturallythe two general principles of ideasadvertisementjames describes two principles of the production of ideas which i really like an idea is nothing more or less than a new combination of old elements the capacity to bring old elements into new combinations depends largely on the ability to see relationships this second one is really important in producing new ideas but it’s something our minds need to be trained in to some minds each fact is a separate bit of knowledge to others it is a link in a chain of knowledge to help our brains get better at delivering good ideas to us we need to do some preparation first let’s take a look at what it takes to prime our brains for ideagenerationpreparing to get new ideassince ideas are made from finding relationships between existing elements we need to collect a mental inventory of these elements before we can start connecting them james also notes in his book how we often approach this process incorrectly instead of working systematically at the job of gathering raw material we sit around hoping for inspiration to strike us preparing your brain for the process of making new connections takes time and effort we need to get into the habit of collecting information that’s all around us so our brains have something to work withjames offers a couple of ideas in his book such as using index cards to organize and distill information into bitesized pieces another suggestion is to use a scrapbook or file and crossindex everything so you can find what you need when you need itadvertisementbringing it all togetherthe hard work is mostly in gathering the materials your brain needs to form new connections but you can do a lot to help your brain process all of this information as wellin a paper by neuroscientist dr mark beeman he explains how we come to our final “aha” moment of producing an idea by way of other activities a series of studies have used electroencephalography eeg and functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to study the neural correlates of the “aha moment” and its antecedents although the experience of insight is sudden and can seem disconnected from the immediately preceding thought these studies show that insight is the culmination of a series of brain states and processes operating at different time scales i love the way that john cleese talks about these aspects of creativity and how our minds work he gave an excellent talk years ago about how our brains develop ideas and solve creative problems wherein he discussed the idea of our brains being like tortoises here’s how i explained his theory when i wrote about it earlier this year the idea is that your creativity acts like a tortoise–poking its head out nervously to see if the environment is safe before it fully emerges thus you need to create a tortoise enclosure–an oasis amongst the craziness of modern life–to be a safe haven where your creativity can emerge he offers a couple of useful ideas to help you achieve this as wellset aside timejohn says your thoughts need time to settle down before your creativity will feel safe enough to emerge and get to work setting aside time to think regularly can be a good way to train your mind to relax eventually making this set time a safe haven for your tortoise mind to start putting together connections that could turn into ideasadvertisementfind a creative spacesetting aside time regularly sends a signal to your brain that it’s safe to work on creative ideas finding a particular space to be creative in can help toothis is similar to the research on how the temperature and noise around us affects our creativitylet your brain do the workthis may be one of the hardest yet most important parts of the process of producing ideas i think james webb young says it best drop the whole subject and put it out of your mind and let your subconscious do its thing something else john cleese talks about is how beneficial it can be to “sleep on a problem” he recalls observing a dramatic change in his approach to a creative problem after having left it alone he not only awoke with a perfectly clear idea on how to continue his work but the problem itself was no longer apparentthe trick here is to trust enough to let goadvertisementas we engage our conscious minds in other tasks like sleeping or taking a shower our subconscious can go to work on finding relationships in all the data we’ve collected so farthe aha moment james webb young explains the process of producing ideas in stages once we’ve completed the first three which include gathering material and letting our subconscious process the data and find connections he says we’ll come to an “aha” moment when a great idea hits us it will come to you when you are least expecting it–while shaving or bathing or most often when you are half awake in the morning it may waken you in the middle of the night how to have more great ideasunderstanding the process our brains go through to produce ideas can help us to replicate this but there are a few things we can do to nudge ourselves towards having better ideas toocriticize your ideas–don’t accept them immediatelythe final stage of james’s explanation of idea production is to criticize your ideas do not make the mistake of holding your idea close to your chest at this stage submit it to the criticism of the judicious james says this will help you to expand on the idea and uncover possibilities you might have otherwise overlookedadvertisementhere it’s especially important to know whether you’re introverted or extroverted to criticize your ideas from the right perspectiveoverwhelm your brain–it can handle itsurprisingly you can actually hit your brain with more than it can handle and it will step up to the taskrobert epstein explained in a psychology today article how challenging situations can bring out our creativity even if you don’t succeed at whatever you’re doing you’ll wake up the creative areas of your brain and they’ll perform better after the failed task to compensatehave more bad ideas to have more good onesit turns out that having a lot of bad ideas also means you’ll have a lot of good ideas studies have proved this at both mit and the university of california davisadvertisementthe sheer volume of ideas produced by some people means that they can’t help having lots of bad ones but they’re likely to have more good ones as wellseth godin wrote about how important it is to be willing to produce a lot of bad ideas saying that people who have lots of ideas like entrepreneurs writers and musicians all fail far more often than they succeed but they fail less than those who have no ideas at allhe summed this up with an example that i love someone asked me where i get all my good ideas explaining that it takes him a month or two to come up with one and i seem to have more than that i asked him how many bad ideas he has every month he paused and said “none” how do you come up with ideas every day i’d love your thoughts on this in the comments below—belle beth cooper is a content crafter at buffer and cofounder of hello code follow her on
