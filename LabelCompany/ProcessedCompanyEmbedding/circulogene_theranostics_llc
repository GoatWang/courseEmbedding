biopsy” services leverage proven technology and provide a noninvasive and costeffective solution for highsensitivity monitoring across a variety of samples including blood our unique fingerstick technology provides unprecedented tumor monitoring information with an uptodate clinical status in a more complete accurate timely less expensive and less invasive fashion cliareadyclinically validated assaysunprecedented high recovery of cellfree dna from droplet volumes of blood translates into high sensitivityopen platforms ion torrent proton for both mutation monitoring and profilingintegrated workflow for consistent and reliable longitudinal studies clinical challenges individualized cancer management for treating cancer patients with precision therapy is currently still challenged by the following limitations tumor heterogeneity tumors are heterogeneous and exhibit continuously polyclonal expansion in turn complicating diagnosis treatment and the assessment of acquired resistance furthermore tumor tissues are limited both spatially to the region biopsied and temporarily to the state of tumor at the time of biopsy accessibility of tumor tissue the majority of patients treated with targeted therapies ultimately develop resistance metastasis or recurrence effective monitoring with several tumor samples is not clinically practical with current invasive biopsy techniques most importantly tumor tissue may not be available or has been exhausted due to multiple testings unmet needs in liquid biopsy and circulogene’s solution novel cellfree dna enrichment method for high quantity and high quality starting materials circulating cellfree dna is highly fragmented and presented at very low concentrations this makes its isolation challenging due to the requirements of highvolume input costs and labor intensity our proprietary cellfree dna enrichment process possesses the novel characteristic of low input as low as  ul of plasma and high output ngml allowing ultrahigh recovery and detection of tumor dna directly from a droplet volume of unprocessed blood advanced ngs technology for sensitive longitudinal mutation detection detection of lowfrequency mutations through periodic cellfree dna analysis could predict tumor progression before the lesions are large enough to be detected by imaging analysis beyond a single mutation could also be warranted to capture tumor heterogeneity for effective treatment decision making liquid biopsies are not as spatially limited as tissue biopsies and can show a global spectrum of mutations that occur throughout tumor development in our body the sensitivity of conventional analytical methods such as sanger sequencing is not sufficient to detect lowfrequency variants targeted deep sequencing by nextgeneration sequencing ngs provides a costeffective alternative for highthroughput analysis of multiple mutations with high sensitivity validated sample processing and analysis

sample collection large sample volume lowyield and laborintensiveness are the major barriers to the routine use of cellfree dnabased testing in current clinical settings specifically cellfree dna recovery efficiency using the current standard silica membranebead method is extremely low due to unavoidable loss in steps such as binding washing and elution this in turn results in a minimum sample requirement of ml of blood while almost all liquid biopsy providers are working and perfecting their novel technologies to selectively enrich or amplify tumorspecific cellfree dna from a dominantly normal population their starting materials are still those “incomplete” dna molecules that survived after extractionisolation as a result no matter how sensitive their technology is downstream they cannot detect cellfree dna already lost during sample preparation upstream further there is uncertainty if even  ml of blood is enough in contrast circulogene theranostics focuses on the first step in the cellfree dna process making sure we capture all of the cellfree dna molecules existing in the original sample our breakthrough proprietary method enables recovery of both necrotic and apoptotic

streamlined and robust workflow optimized for cellfree dna enrichmentrecovery from a droplet of plasma or serum as an alternative to lowquantity poor quality dna from challenging tissue biopsy samples this sample preparation breakthrough enables multiple analyses on a droplet sample by a broad range of genomic platforms including nextgeneration sequencing ngs microarrays quantitative pcr qpcr and droplet digital pcr ddpcr working with challenging and precious samples is no longer a barrier to personalized cancer therapy our technology allows us to work with a sample volume as small as

proprietary fingerstick cancer monitoring technology launches circulogene theranostics into liquid biopsy market breakthrough cellfree dna testing method enables fast accurate personalized cancer monitoring and treatment guidance with a single blood drop birmingham ala november   business wire–circulogene theranostics has announced the commercial launch of its cellfree dna cfdna liquid biopsy products for the fast accurate and personalized testing of  tumor types including breast lung and colon cancer circulogene becomes the first and only biotechnology company able to enrich circulating cfdna from a single blood drop for patientspecific monitoring of cancer cellfree dna comes from tumor cells that break open and release small pieces of dna into the bloodstream “as soon as a patient receives a positive diagnosis of cancer from his or her physician our test provides a rapid and cost effective tool to aid the physician in planning implementing and monitoring the treatment process” said circulogene ceo mike mullen “research has shown cancers change rapidly and shed tumor dna into circulating blood our technology detects and monitors tumor changes in a very specific and sensitive way this allows us to report to physicians in just days to aid them in selecting the right therapy for the right patient at the right time” the result is potentially the most precise rapid and costeffective monitoring and targeted treatment of cancer possible newly published clinical research demonstrates the company’s proprietary method can collect more than  times more cfdna with just  of the blood as little as  microliters compared to the current industry standard for noninvasive liquid biopsy testing circulogene’s proprietary technology is capable of detecting nearly  cancer mutations on  wellestablished cancerassociated genes for its  cancer profiles noninvasive liquid biopsies represent a major advance over traditional surgical tumor biopsies which are costly time consuming and only sample a small portion of tumor tissue leading to a high failure rate however current industrystandard liquid biopsy methods require large sample amounts and could miss critical tumor information that can significantly change a patient’s treatment and prognosis “our science team is pioneering the next generation of liquid biopsy cancer management tumor monitoring from droplet volumes of blood no one else is doing that” said circulogene chief scientific officer chenhsiung yeh “our proprietary dna enrichment method results in nearfull recovery of cfdna with just  to  microliters of blood no venipuncture is required and when combined with nextgeneration genomic sequencing we have an unprecedented laboratory diagnostic test platform for improving cancer management” in addition to providing the most accurate actionable information the company’s proprietary cfdna enrichment method delivers highly costeffective genetic results from a single drop of various body fluids including blood in as little as seven days instead of weeks or months with this major technological advance mullen shares the industry’s belief that tumor genome sequencing of circulating cfdna to manage cancer treatment can potentially become an important component of the standard of care “we’ve assembled a highly experienced and credentialed diagnostic team around a muchneeded technology” said mullen “similar to how diabetics monitor glucose levels our test can accurately identify established genetic tumor mutations drug resistance and remission in diagnosed cancer patients using a simple finger stick and drops of blood this allows oncologists to use current fdaapproved and nccnascoendorsed treatment options to respond to these changes at a fraction of the cost of standard liquid biopsy testing” circulogene will initially provide testing for the following cancers breast colorectal lung gastric gastrointestinal stromal gist hematological melanoma ovarian pancreatic and thyroid the company is currently partnering with researchers across the country to conduct further clinical trials at leading biotechnology research universities and exploring partnership
