properties mpw michael boyd longshort equity contrarian mediumterm horizon midcapmarketplaceindustrial insightssummarymedical properties trust has ridden a wave of bad news over the past six months shares have held up quite well all things consideredthat is a testament to underlying quality of management who have also done a good job of spinning bad news in a positive lightthe recent stewardiasis transaction is a great one from an accretion standpoint but tenant concentration concerns are going to remain elevatedif you own it already it is worth a hold accumulate in the share range assuming the longterm story isnt damagedmedical properties trust nysempw has traveled a bumpy road over the past year but i think that company management has done an excellent job of dispelling relevant fears surrounding the companys portfolio during that time healthcare reits in general have been under pressure and any time an reit has a key tenant file for bankruptcy investors have a tendency to run for the exits in a further build of pressure the recent credit outlook cut to negative from sp following a major acquisition announcement likely did not help either is the recent haircut in share price enough or would investors be better suited waiting for a better price business overview medical properties trust acquires and develops healthcare facilities leasing those assets to operators under longterm triple net leases as well as making mortgage loans to operators collateralized by their real estate assets bear in mind the company does take advantage of the ridea structure in some situations a law which allows reits to benefit from underlying operating performance of the asset via equity investment equitylike loans cash flow and returns from these investments are going to be more volatile than triplenet leasing total ridea investment totaled m at the end of fiscal   not a large investment by any means but it is an aspect of operations investors should be aware of while more than three quarters of revenue comes from the united states the company is starting to nibble overseas particularly within the german market the united kingdom is a likely focus point as well as spain new facility just opened there in valencia management has expressed continued interest in overseas expansion such as cfo steven hamners comments that the company will be back in europe to complete what we started in  however both domestically and overseas property type emphasis is on general acute care hospitals gach which have grown from  of revenue in  to  in the most recent period inpatient rehabilitation hospitals irh have seen growing emphasis as well the company has been moving away from longterm acute care hospitals ltach or facilities that require specialty care with longer stays and intense special treatment for patients  of assets generally these facilities are higher margin for operators but usually see significantly more volatility in earnings gach which provide inpatient care for acute conditions as well as ambulatory care through hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms are performing well and are generally viewed rightly in my opinion more safely in a similar vein company properties have been converting to hospital outpatient departments hopds in general rates come down after hopd conversion but margins stay within spitting distance just from increased volume the added benefit is that higher patient traffic creates a more stable revenue base so any downtick in margin is made up for in volume the impact of this weak ltach results strength from gach hopd facilities can be seen in the most recent reported quarter where ltach ebitdar coverage fell x compared to x coverage at gach it wouldnt be a surprise to see these ltach facilities eventually cut off from the operation and sold  if the price is right adeptus bankruptcy implications texasbased adeptus the nations largest freestanding emergency room operator officially announced bankruptcy in april of this year the company blamed a tight regulatory market as well as vendor pst services botching its revenue cycle management services for the company which caused nearly m in writeoffs the court has approved the companys restructuring plan which involved affiliates of longterm shareholder deerfield providing interim funding which follows the move by deerfield buying out m in bank debt early in april the newly capitalized adeptus will assume  of master leased facilities at current rates with the rest either being released to the prior venture partner and the rest  being either sold or released to new operators medical properties trust will provide a onetime credit of m during the twelve months postbankruptcy there are thirteen facilities being released from the adeptus master lease six of them within ninety days of bankruptcy existence and the rest after one year medical properties trust has the option to sell or release sooner until they are separated from the master lease adeptus will be responsible for  of current rent throughout bankruptcy and all the way up through the release date management has stated interest is very high from multiple operators on these thirteen properties and the company believes it can either sell or release without any material adverse impact medical properties trust management has done a solid job of spinning this story as positive despite  of noi having been caught up in a tenant bankruptcy the story has instead been shown as a testament to the strong underwriting and underlying value of the companys real estate i cant say i disagree over the companys thirteenyear history during which the company has owned more than  hospitals there have been no signs of the company ever taking what i would call a material real estate impairment even missed rental payments have been few and far between stewardiasis acquisition management made it clear that the company had plenty of dry powder over the last several years post equity raise pro forma debt to ebitda of x was well below the companys target of x as well as below medical properties trusts peer group the companys quarterly press release stated the company believed it had the ability to make up to b in additional investments without the need of additional equity all while keeping the debt ratio within selfimposed levels that should have been a clear sign what was on the horizon this is essentially a threeway deal with steward health care acquiring iasis healthcare operations with medical properties trust stepping in to control iasis real estate via saleleaseback and mortgage transactions total consideration is m roughly two thirds split between rental income and mortgage interest income in line with current consolidated company breakdown medical properties trust has quickly been building a relationship with steward which is now the largest private forprofit hospital operator in the united states back in october of last year the company closed on a portfolio of nine acute care hospitals in massachusetts for m m saleleaseback m in mortgages m ridea investment given that this prior transaction pushed steward to the companys top tenant by gross assets  after this deal that will now be above  tenant concentration concerns are likely on the minds of many particularly given the consolidated steward  ebitdar coverage estimate of x is slightly below the total medical properties trust portfolio x while steward is private controlled by cerberus it did provide some pro forma estimates of stewards balance sheet that pin net debtebitda leverage in the x range well below peer averages while the kneejerk concern is concern over whether steward could be the next adeptus both companies operate in different markets and having the backing of cerberus b in private equity aum will always give steward an edge if things do turn south nonetheless management is looking to get stewards exposure down below  either by joint ventures or straight growth this likely isnt a speedy way to reduce exposure particularly given leverage is now in the target range so growth via acquisition is not going to be aggressive over the next several years valuation the final word medical properties trust does not break out net operating income noi that i can see but backing into it from  gaap m gaap operating income  m gain on property sales  m impairment charge  m depreciation gets us to m in noi based on current enterprise value the gut reaction is to figure that the implied cap rate is  but the company has been making substantial moves as of late medical properties trust recently priced a substantial equity deal to raise cash after q close to fund the m stewardiasis acquisition funded by that equity raise m a substantial portion of cash on hand m and a likely senior unsecured debt issuance m if investors assume a  cap rate on acquisition current guidance expectations should be for m in additional net operating income along with m in natural noi growth this coming year after the impact on enterprise value from the steward transaction it appears the entirety of the portfolio will trade at a  cap rate assuming no real change in market value of the companys shares by the time all the pieces fall into places this points to a slight premium to net asset value nav given historical sales history of similar freestanding emergency room properties for instance medical properties trust divested several assets associated with the capella healthcare merger from early  recently receiving roughly  cap rates on those sales such a premium  to nav would not be outlandish in the healthcare reit space but for those that love fishing for reits trading at or below nav a share price in the share range would be where you should start nibbling i think that is the way to place this one medical properties trust is going to trade around yield and i think the distribution isnt going to see any outsized growth in the short term given the likely focus on reducing leverage back down fair value is my estimate in the share range which would put the yield at  a little bit of a discount to historical levels given overall market sentiment fresh counterparty risk and a more worrisome balance sheet picking up shares in the mid sshare builds in  upside a minimum level that i personally look for before considering a purchase with that said holding at current prices likely isnt going to hurt anyone the company is wellrun has excellent growth opportunities and is a clear leader in this space it is
