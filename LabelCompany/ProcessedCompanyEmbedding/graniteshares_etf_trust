are not annualized nav prices are used to calculate market price performance prior to the date when the trust first traded on the new york stock exchange market performance is determined using the bidask midpoint at pm eastern time when the nav is typically calculated market performance does not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times for the trust’s most recent month end performance please call   or visit wwwgranitesharescom daily premium discount as of tbc nav price current data     premium discount  frequency chart how can the trust trade at a premiumdiscount to its nav the primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the nav and the closing price of the trust since shares of the trust trade on the open market prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors corporations and financial institutions depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment shares of the trust may deviate slightly from the value of the trusts underlying assets as a result shareholders may pay more than nav when they buy trust shares and receive less than nav when they sell those shares because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices however due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to trusts market makers are able to minimize these deviations from nav by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities what causes these time discrepancies close of trading times although both the nav and the closing trade of the trust are generally calculated at the closing time of  pm et some differences in this timing may cause discrepancies time of last trade trading of graniteshares trusts generally takes place during normal trading hours  am to  pm eastern time however it is important to note that the last trade when closing price is determined may not occur at exactly  pm eastern time therefore any market move during the time difference may cause the

investors with an alternative that allows a level of participation in the gold market through the securities market the sponsor of the trust is graniteshares llc the trust is distributed by foreside fund services llc graniteshares is not affiliated with foreside fund services llc fund risks investing in the shares involves significant risks including possible loss of principal you could lose money on an investment in the trust for a more complete discussion of risk factors relative to the trust carefully read the prospectus shares are created to reflect the price of the gold held by the trust the market price of the shares will be as unpredictable as the price of gold has historically been this creates the potential for losses regardless of whether you hold shares for the short mid or longterm the amount of gold represented by each share will decrease over the life of the trust due to the sales of gold necessary to pay the sponsor’s fee and trust expenses without increases in the price of gold sufficient to compensate for that decrease the price of the shares will also decline and you will lose money on your investment in shares the trust is a passive investment vehicle the price received upon the sale of shares may be less than the value of the gold represented by them the trust is not a diversified investment it may be more volatile than other investments the trust may be forced to sell gold earlier than anticipated if expenses are higher than expected the sponsor has no history of operating an investment vehicle like the trust its experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the trust gold benchmark  lbma gold price pm ice benchmark administration iba is the administrator for the lbma gold price  graniteshares inc all rights reserved graniteshares
