tribe interred its dead and then portaged to the wisconsin river “a gentel glideing stream” and part of the mississippi drainage system near the end of september he arrived at the sauk village on the north side of the wisconsin in his narrative he recorded cultural traits of that tribe “thay are    les inclined to tricks and bad mannars then thane nighbers    sum of thane huts are sixtey feet long and contanes saverl fammalyes    the women rase grat crop of corn been pumkens – potatoes millans    thay are not verey gellas of thare women” he then descended the river some  miles to a village of foxes “a differant sort of people who was bread at detroit under the french government and clarge till thay by chrisanissing grew so bad thay the french ware oblige to go to war a ganst them” and who now lived in “sad sarkamstanis” they had recently been infected by an epidemic and pond remained only one day managing to do a little trading before continuing downstream to the mississippi there at prairie du chien he found many french traders and indians purchasing supplies for the winter hunt he stayed ten days while he dispatched nine clerks to various tributaries of the wisconsin and mississippi for trade in october  he left for the st peters river minnesota river minn with two other traders on the river about  miles from its mouth he found a log house which he supposed to be that of jonathan carver where the explorer had wintered in – pond later wrote that he thought little of carver and could have completed his whole tour in six weeks pond passed the winter of – on the high banks of the st peters river and conducted business with the indians in gentle competition with a french trader when the ice broke and the water level receded pond’s party descended the river to prairie du chien he collected pelts from various tribes gathered there against keen trade from new orleans the illinois and michilimackinac “all my outfits had dun well” he wrote “i had a grate share for my part as i furnish much the largest cargo on the river” this statement suggests that pond was relying heavily on bulk imports and that he had a good source of supply in july  he was back at michilimackinac where he found his partner graham with a large cargo pond had done so well that he proposed to buy graham out he paid him for the  cargo “and well on toward the one he had brot me” pond’s first venture had ended he had learned the trade mastered the art of getting along with fellow traders and at the same time outtrading them when necessary become familiar with wilderness travel and survival and emerged a successful capitalist he entered into partnership with another merchant thomas williams an arrangement that would last until  trade from michilimackinac to the mississippi was severely threatened when war between the ojibwas and sioux broke out again a lake superior trader brought news of the fighting to the fort about the first of august  the commandant arent schuyler depeyster gathered pond and the other traders together had six large wampum belts made three for each nation and sent pond to the sioux and other agents to the ojibwas chiefs of the opposing sides were to assemble at michilimackinac in the spring of  for a council pond went to prairie du chien and found the sioux there not involved in the fighting he took the occasion to go up the st peters river to trade with a band of yankton sioux who had never met whites and of whose customs he left an important ethnological account after wintering at his post on the st peters he assembled  sioux chiefs and explained the wampum belts he then headed for michilimackinac with them the group was joined at prairie du chien by indians of various tribes who were waiting there at michilimackinac depeyster chaired a grand council which was followed by a decade of peace between the warring parties see josephlouis ainsse after this venture pond never returned to the upper mississippi deciding instead to pursue trade in the northwest via grand portage near grand portage minn he was at the time a partner in the firm of pond and graves which seems to have been a subsidiary of pond and williams traders from montreal and from the hudson’s bay company had recently begun moving into the saskatchewan valley seeking better quality pelts doubtless knowing of these prospects pond joined alexander henry on  aug  near the cree village at the mouth of the winnipeg river three weeks later they were overtaken by joseph and thomas frobisher and charles paterson the whole party consisting of  canoes and  men reached the mouth of the saskatchewan on  october they ascended the river to the hbc’s cumberland house sask where they were greeted with civility but as unwanted guests by matthew cocking the canoes separated and pond went south through little lake winnipeg lake winnipegosis man and travelled up mossy river to winter at his fort dauphin which he locates on the northwest corner of dauphin lake itself unless an agreement to cooperate had been undertaken pond would have been in opposition to john cole at peter pangman’s fort dauphin pond was not trading with the “common concern” of henry pangman paterson jeanbaptiste cadot and james finlay at dauphin lake there was plenty of buffalo meat available and he was in a position to intercept indians bound for cumberland house in  pond went to michilimackinac and arranged to have the next season’s goods brought to grand portage he had realized the necessity of keeping his supply base as far forward as possible in so doing he assisted the process whereby grand portage and later fort william thunder bay ont supplanted michilimackinac as the western supply depot of the northwest fur trade he evidently wintered for the next two years – and – at the junction of the sturgeon river sask and the north saskatchewan a short distance downriver from the place where hbc employee robert longmoor would soon challenge the pedlars’ hold on trade apparently on  april  pond had entered partnership with trader george mcbeath who was also associated with simon mctavish it was mcbeath who looked after the montreal to grand portage section of the enterprise with pond the success of thomas frobisher in  at lac îleàlacrosse on the edge of the athabasca watershed led others to push forward in that direction in the spring of  several traders chiefly representing the two houses of benjamin and joseph frobisher and mctavish and company put into common stock their spare goods at pine island lake cumberland lake sask they gave management of the enterprise to pond who had four canoes for the expedition he was instructed to enter the english river the upper churchill follow thomas frobisher’s route and if possible go into the athabasca region a country little known to the pedlars except by indian report this joint concern says harold adams innis “was probably the direct forerunner of the north west company” pond wintered on the athabasca river about  miles from the lake in – there he saw a “vast concourse” of crees and chipewyans who went down each year to prince of wales’s fort churchill man via lengthy difficult routes according to alexander mackenzie who was in the athabasca country himself a decade after these tribes were pleased to see traders who would “relieve them from such long toilsome and dangerous journies and were immediately reconciled to give an advanced price for the articles necessary to their comfort and convenience” pond was thus able to obtain more furs than his canoes could carry accordingly he stockpiled the remainder in winter huts in the spring of  pond came heavily laden out of athabasca at the completion of what was in effect a trading expedition of two summers’ duration on  july he arrived at cumberland house “with three canoes from the northward very much distressed for want of food having bad success on his journey down his canoes being broke upon the fall’s” from the master william walker who treated him civilly for previous kindnesses he acquired tobacco powder and meat pond told walker that he had gone far enough north to trade with “the northward indians” among whom samuel hearne had been with matonabbee during trading he said he had made  packs of  pounds each but had been obliged to leave most of them behind since one pack contained about  pelts the whole would have constituted some  made beaver historian edwin ernest rich states that in  pond brought out more than  fine beaver skins this would have been about  tons of furs – an extraordinary load for three canoes given that the average canot du nord had a carrying capacity of a ton and a half pond told walker freely of his discoveries and informed him of portage la loche about  miles in length and so steep that it had taken the party eight days to complete it this portage ran between lac la loche in the hudson bay watershed and the pelican clearwater river in the athabasca drainage pond continued east to grand portage and returned to athabasca directly to bring out the furs he had left behind the licence issued to him in montreal in  for four canoes to be sent up to grand portage must therefore have been given in his absence he spent the winter of – at michilimackinac arriving on  november with seven engagés in a bateau from lake superior and remaining at least until  may he entered a partnership with mcbeath and booty graves and returned west to winter in – with jeanétienne waddens at lac la ronge sask the two men represented different and yet interrelated trading interests pond’s was the larger and was built around the more sizeable montreal houses such as those of the frobishers and simon mctavish waddens was acting for an association of smaller houses such as those of forrest oakes and john ross the two groups were in some way affiliated and in  it had been intended that waddens should replace pond in trading with the indians of athabasca however rivalry between the two sets of interests was not resolved and in a compromise arrangement the men were to trade side by side at lac la ronge in – they were reported to be of distinctly different character and ill will developed between them doubtless also because of economic competition in february they fought but details are not known at the beginning of march waddens was shot and mortally wounded perhaps by pond or his clerk waddens’s widow pressed charges but historians disagree as to whether or not pond stood trial relying no doubt on a remark by alexander mackenzie innis claims that “it may be assumed” pond was tried and acquitted in montreal during the winter of – the only documentation located however is a deposition by waddens’s clerk and arthur silver morton maintains that the absence of any record of a trial indicates pond was merely examined he suggests that the case was not taken to court because the murder had occurred in a region beyond the jurisdiction of quebec’s legal system pond wintered on lac îleàlacrosse in – and then proceeded to athabasca probably in the spring the years between  and  had seen a growing tendency of furtrade interests to coalesce and a series of agreements usually annual eventually produced the first declared north west company formed in – and intended to last for five years pond seems to have had one of the  shares in the  company and in his absence he was allotted one share in the – organization pond probably explored waters downriver of lake athabasca but how far is not known he learned from indians the approximate location of great slave and great bear lakes and perhaps of the peace and mackenzie rivers especially in – he came into contact with many indians from the country north of lake athabasca and he secured for the nor’westers a trade that the hbc was unable to divert in  pond came out to grand portage and to montreal where in february  he became a charter member of the beaver club during the winter of – pond drew his celebrated map showing the rivers and lakes from the great lakes and hudson bay westward to the rocky mountains and northward to the arctic it indicates a large river flowing from lake athabasca to slave great slave lake and thence to the arctic ocean called by pond “supposed the ice sea” one copy of the map was prepared for submission to the united states congress in april  another was given to the lieutenant governor of quebec henry hamilton as was a memorial signed by pond and probably written by the frobishers which asked hamilton to support a scheme for discoveries of the northwestern reaches of north america under pond’s leadership anxious to assist pond and prevent him from aiding the united states or another country hamilton urged the british government but unsuccessfully to help him and the nor’westers feeling that he deserved more than the one share he had been assigned by the nwc agreement of – pond had at first refused it and considered joining with john ross and peter pangman instead ultimately however he accepted the share and in  he returned to athabasca via grand portage john ross also went there to compete with him in the summers of  and  pond made excursions from his post extending trade towards the peace river and organizing his base and provisions in the winter of – competition became severe and ross was “shot in a scuffle with mr pond’s men” according to one report the news of ross’s death resulted in a decision by the leaders of the rival interests to unite and bring an end to the murderous competition two of pond’s men were arrested and brought to quebec for trial but they were acquitted evidence suggests the killer was one péché peshe who afterwards traded from slave river among the chipewyans hbc surveyor peter fidler wrote in his journal of  that “mr ross was shot by one peshe a canadian by order of pond” in the spring of  pond left the northwest never to return from the time of the murder of waddens in  he had been a marked man and his time in the west limited this situation was reemphasized with ross’s murder five years later despite pond’s apparent remoteness from the episode the second death led to his withdrawal or forced retirement from the fur trade alexander mackenzie profited from pond’s pioneering enterprises and geographical ideas building a career and reputation on business activities suggested by pond’s theories and activities pond continued to produce maps of the northwest one dated  dec  he presented to lord dorchester guy carleton at quebec dorchester sent it to london in november  but a simplified copy had already been published in the gentleman’s magazine of march  pond made yet another version intended for the empress of russia these maps show that he had become aware of captain james cook’s discoveries what is now called cook inlet alaska was thought by the captain to be a river flowing from the east and pond’s  maps strongly suggest that it drains from a gigantic great slave lake in  alexander mackenzie explored the river leading out of that lake and found it flowed to the arctic as pond’s first maps had indicated pond’s willingness to change on the basis of cook’s unsubstantiated discovery dramatically hurt his credibility as a map maker but he was not alone in making the error pond was not included in the  reorganization of the nwc having sold his share that year to william mcgillivray for £ dorchester had knowledge that pond quit the province of quebec owing to his dissatisfaction with the nwc his intention dorchester said was to seek employment in his native united states that same year pond visited president ezra stiles of yale college who made a copy of his map in november  he was offered an unspecified share in a projected “company for the nw” in opposition to the nwc by john howard jacob jordan and samuel birnie to be supported by jordan’s backers brickwood pattle and company of london pond’s response to this proposal is not known on  jan  “captain” peter pond and william steedman were instructed by the american secretary of war to go to niagara and detroit to seek from warring indians a request for peace see michikinakoua whether pond went has not been discovered the latter years of his life were spent in the united states most probably at milford and he passed the time reading the travels of the baron de lahontan louisarmand de lom d’arce and jonathan carver he died impoverished in  peter pond national historic site at the junction of the sturgeon river and the north saskatchewan and peter pond lake sask have been named after him pond’s contemporaries generally regarded him with a mixture of admiration and suspicion admiration for his energetic activities suspicion for his association with murders and for his american background east india company hydrographer alexander dalrymple doubted his loyalty to the crown alexander henry who used pond’s discoveries for his own benefit and without acknowledgement called him a “trader of celebrity” dr john mervin nooth who met him in quebec thought him “a very singular person” judge isaac ogden favoured him as “a gentleman of observation and science” trader roderick mckenzie said pond “thought himself a philosopher and was odd in his manners” alexander mackenzie obviously was jealous of pond’s preeminence and of his discoveries actual and suggested explorer david thompson wrote of pond “he was a person of industrious habits a good common education but of a violent temper and unprincipled character” this unfavourable attitude forms a common thread in the works of later writers including charles lindsey and e e rich even innis his biographer calls his achievements “in many ways remarkable but    not of a sensational character” pond was an unusual man more energetic more aggressive and more capable of organizing than most traders lured by profits from northern furs he pushed farther north and west than any other trader in the s and s he was the first white man to cross portage la loche also known as methye portage to the athabasca river and lake athabasca the discovery linked the mackenzie watershed with the rivers flowing to hudson bay in this achievement pond succeeded where others especially thomas frobisher had failed the first white trader to push into the athabasca country he induced rivals in competition to his lucrative commerce and his activities led to the first organization named the north west company they also opened what mackenzie called the “new eldorado” of the nwc around which the company’s prospects for the s and afterwards revolved pond’s use of supplies including pemmican and his good organization were keys to his success they enabled him to travel farther and to trade better than his predecessors they also set the pattern for nwc exploitation of the athabasca country his reputation for violence however invited the suspicion of other traders both inside and outside the concern and eventually forced his withdrawal from the company pond was the first to outline the general features of the mackenzie river system his findings fired mackenzie with the possibilities of discovery in the north and led him to follow the course of the great river to its frozen mouth in  pond’s maps and suggested course of the waters of athabasca are enduring testaments to him as a pioneer in the last great furbearing area of north america barry m gough pond’s narrative was probably written some time after he reached the age of  many years later sophia m mooney the wife of nathan gillette pond

a boy this would have fit very nicely into the thenusual tradition of having the character played by an actress in jm barries play or the musical made from it were it not for the fact that the model

applied you also need to apply the proflex on a day with rain is not expected as it cannot rain on the proflex should it rain on the proflex you will need to sand the primer and recoat rusty or pitted metal should be wire brushed to remove loose oxide tightly adhering corrosion may be directly coated with pondpro ® coverage pondpro ® coverage on a smooth surface is  sq ft per individual gallon each unit of pondpro ® comes with its own premeasured bottle of catalyst the activator that starts the curing process normal application rate is a  mil thickness which equates to about five individual pieces of paper please wait a full  hours before filling the pond assuming it has not rained during that time if it did rain on the newly coated pondpro simply add those additional hours to the original  hours once the rain has evaporated any unmixed material that you do not need can be stored for up to three years if you need assistance calculating the coverage you can give our office a call toll free at how to mix pondpro  for pondpro ® you may notice once you open the container there is adequate space to add the bottle of catalyst and mix the material in the same can you will need a drill and a gallon mixer attachment for this each bottle of catalyst is contained in the gallon box when mixing you want to be sure that the drill is creating a vortex and that the material is mixed for a good  minutes during the mixing you also want to bring the drill up and down and also in a circular motion so that the material is all distributed uniformly the application process the most effective method of application is by a combination of brush roller or squeegee after mixing pour out the material in a figure s pattern on the large flat surfaces of your pond by first distributing the material with a squeegee when you notice the squeegee is not bringing any more material back on the rubber of the squeegee you then go back over the area with a  inch roller to level for smaller ponds and verticals a paintbrush is the appropriate distribution method the curing process one of the unique benefits of pondpro ® vs other pond sealers on the market is that it cures by adding a unique catalyst to the quart or gallon can once the catalyst is mixed you have approximately  minutes to apply depending on temperature the higher the temperature the less pot life if you want to take your time you can mix half of the catalyst and half of the pondpro during the curing process there is very unique crosslinking process that occurs when the pondpro literally chemically bonds itself to the surface leaving no air trapped within the pond substrate and the pondpro this is why the pondpro is the only pond product you will ever need to purchase in order to fix your leak right the first time please allow a full  hours of temperatures of  degrees or above before you fill you pond with water if the temperature goes below  degrees just add that lost time to your overall cure time pondpro ® can tolerate extreme temperatures as low as forty degrees below zero and waterproofs immediately after it has been applied so regardless of the area of the country you are in there is never a need to worry about the product cracking sunlight uv and humidity will have no effect on the product how to mix proflex primer note proflex is only required when another rd party coating was applied over the original pond substrate proflex primer is a two component ready to apply flexible epoxy primer with a one to one volume mix ratio proflex should not be tacky when applying pondpro should you press down on the proflex and determine it is still tacky please allow the proflex to dry a little longer generally this condition occurs  hours after the proflex has been applied you also want to apply the proflex on a day when rain is not expected as it cannot rain on the proflex the day which you apply the proflex primer needs to be above  degrees lower temperatures at night will slow the cure but will not affect the product do not apply proflex if you anticipate freezing temperatures before you are able to apply the pondpro  pondpro  contact us  pond leaks repair ☰ home why pond pro

onecoat application withstands seasonal freezes and thaws nontoxic to fish and plants uvozone resistant puncture resistant waterproofs immediately upon application never worry about seams since it forms a seamless membrane applicable on virtually any surface no primers needed on most substrates background pondpro is a very durable two component hybrid polymer based on a urethanepolyether chemistry allowing for chemical crosslinking during the drying process this unique process allows pondpro to literally chemically bond itself to the surface it is being applied on resulting in a superior bond and at the same time a  expansion rate the industry’s best solution for all nonporous concrete fountains pools as well as fishponds liners and reflecting pools these are demanding areas where the unique properties of pond pro have a distinct advantage over other products pondpro  is safe for fish and plant life as well as chlorinated water this polymer when crosslinked is an excellent moisture barrier and resistant to oxidation and uv degradation however its most important property is its ability to tolerate both low as well as high temperatures from ° to over ° f as well as temperature swings through the day and night how does pondpro  compare to other products water resistance pondpro  is superior to epoxies urethanes acrylics polyesters and alkyds at equal film thicknesses and is not affected by continuous immersion uv resistance pondpro  is equal or better than acrylics polyesters or urethanes and much better than alkyds and epoxies temperature tolerance pondpro  is better than all other coating polymers except silicones epdm can withstand live steam as well as cryogenic temperatures flexibility pondpro  is better than all other coating polymers except silicones epdm can withstand live steam as well as cryogenic temperatures chemical resistance pondpro  has very good resistance to strong alkalis concentrated salt solutions many acids and alcohols surface tolerance pondpro  will not bond to a surface that is damp with moisture pondpro also can be applied directly to metal surfaces that have tightly adhering corrosion without a primer where can pondpro  be used to its best advantage the unique combination of properties which pondpro  possesses can be best utilized when they are applied to the exterior surfaces of stationary structures examples are ponds and fountains concrete fishponds fountains and reflecting pools are another good application for epdm underwater applications such as these are very demanding and the unique characteristics of pond pro have the distinct over other products air conditioning drip pans excellent moisture barrier and rust inhibitor concrete tanks the excellent waterproofing properties of epdm will reduce or prevent spalling of concrete in cold climates corrosivehumid exposed structural steel on the interior of industrial buildings with humid or corrosive environments can be coated with minimal surface preparation plating operations smelters concrete casting impoundments liquid epdm coatings are a good choice for exterior spill containment structures because of their excellent
