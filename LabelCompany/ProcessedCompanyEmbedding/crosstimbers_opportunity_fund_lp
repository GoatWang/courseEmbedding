 david hollon  trevor brock  db crosstimbers crosstimbers capital group llc crosstimbers makes direct investments in compelling private equity and project finance opportunities we source proprietary deals from our network structure them for mutual benefit and actively manage their growth approach source unlike traditional private equity funds we don’t rely upon deal brokers or auction processes to source potential investments rather through our established network of family offices regional and national lenders service providers and other executives owners and entrepreneurs we enjoy a robust pipeline of proprietary investment opportunities by originating deals directly and avoiding auctions and their abbreviated timelines we have time to perform deep diligence alongside the owneroperator and to develop trust and rapport outside the restrictions imposed by a formal process structure we believe that the best way to protect and grow resources is through mutually beneficial partnerships with others therefore our investment structures place heavy emphasis on properly aligning incentives we require that our management teams coinvest meaningful capital alongside us and that their success be linked to ours through shared participation in the value that is created after our capital has been returned we also focus on downside protection the majority of our investments will be structured with a liquidation preference and to ensure that our invested capital initially goes onto a company’s balance sheet not in the pocket of its management team manage engaged partnership is a central tenet of our investment strategy we desire to bring more to our portfolio companies than mere capital complementing the skill sets of exceptional entrepreneurs to build lasting valuable companies we have a history throughout our prior investments of working alongside management teams to inform strategy improve operations scale for growth evolve capital structures and position portfolio companies for successful exits investments we evaluate each opportunity sourced from our network against a fourfaceted framework to ensure its suitability we focus on making growth equity investments—that is investments in companies that have an established product or service growing revenue and positive cash flow we invest in smaller rather than larger companies because we believe that smaller companies tend to develop faster present more opportunities to add value and benefit asymmetrically from valuation multiple expansion as they grow we look for companies with hard assets that provide underpinning collateral value in downside scenarios we seek strong management teams with proven business models team david l hollon david serves on the firm’s investment committee and on
