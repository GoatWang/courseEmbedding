a word on the markets as of mar   global equity markets delivered solid gains in the first quarter of  despite a pullback by us stocks late in the period amid dimming prospects for president donald trumps probusiness agenda us stocks advanced for much of the period extending the rally that began with president trumps election in november responding to continued economic growth the us federal reserve the fed raised its benchmark interest rate in march and indicated that further rate hikes would be coming in  taking the fed action as a vote of confidence in the us economy stocks rose following the rate hike bank stocks led the advance on expectations that bank earnings would benefit from higher rates stro ng manufacturing and jobs data also boosted equity markets during february the us added  new jobs topping forecasts while the unemployment rate remained steady at  but us stocks reversed course after president trumps health care bill was withdrawn from congress the health care failure raised concerns about the prospects for the presidents future economic initiatives including tax reduction and infrastructure s pending equities recouped some of the lost ground in the final days of the threemonth period globally signs of economic gains across a broad spectrum of regions encouraged investors during the period in asia rising demand for semiconductors and other electronics boosted growth in the regions exportoriented economies in europe positive eco nomic data and receding political risks helped push stocks higher even countries long mired in recession such as russia and brazil showed signs of recovery during the periodfor the threemonth period the dow jones industrial average rec orded a  gain while the broader sp  index rose  the technologyladen nasdaq

ended march   returning  for class i shares at net asset value versus the indexs  return us small and midcap stocks as represented by the index hit an alltime high in march interestingly the sectors that drove performance this quarter were quite different from last quarter the fourth quarter of  was dominated by the trump trad e with strong gains in financials energy industrials and materials that largely reversed in first quarter  as energy financials and industrials all underperformed performance in the first quarter was largely driven by health care informatio n technology materials and utilities the fund outperformed the index during the quarter driven by both positive stock selection and sector allocation notable contributors at the sector level were health care financials and energy detracting from performance were the consumer discretionary and materials sectors historical returns as of mar   annualized  mo  mos ytd  yr  yrs  yrs  yrs fund at nav        fund wmax sales

the index during the quarter selection gains were greatest in financials health care and consumer staples the strongest contributions from sector allocation came from underweights to energy and real estate and overweights to information technology and health care the health care sector had the largest positive impact on relative performance contributing from good stock selection and sector allocation in particular fund holdings in the health care equipment and supplies industry made a substantive impact the funds top five individual performance contributors included two health care companies teleflex incorporated and idexx laboratories two information technology firms ansys inc and blackbaud inc and an industrial stock transunion detractors  factors detracting from the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter stock selection in the consumer discretionary sector detracted from performance selection in information technology detracted to a lesser degree in consumer discretionary stock selection in the specialty retail industry created a drag on performance in information technology stock selection proved difficult in the software industry during the quarter despite it being a top contributor from an allocation standpoint the funds five primary individual detractors included two industrial stocks acuity brands and jb hunt transport

with the russell  smid cap index trading at a forward pricetoearnings multiple of x the russell  small cap index is at x and closer to x if you included the impact of companie s with negative earnings to put that into context the small cap benchmark has only traded at a higher valuation for a grand total of seven months out of the last  years while expensive valuation measures like pe are typically terrible shortter m market predictors so markets could stay at these valuations or even get more expensive from here over the long term we think the price an investor pays for a stock matters and has a meaningful impact on total return rich market valuation creates both challenges and opportunities one of the biggest risks of investing in an expensive market is that it gets cheaper in times when most stocks look expensive we believe it is critical that the names in a portfolio are high quality like those we see k to own in the strategy as of quarterend the fund contained  stocks representing nine of the  economic sectors comprising the index our bottomup focus on quality continues to drive our relative sector over and underweights relative to the sector weightings in the inde x the fund

commentary as of    market overview smidcap value stocks continued to move higher in the first quarter even as the “riskon” trade lost steam as investors became more defensive particularly in march we witnessed a clear change in sector leadership in the quarter as more cyclical sectors such as energy and interest rate sensitive underperformed while more defensive sectors such as medicalhealthcare and utilities took the lead  within the interest rate sensitive sector banks pulled back reversing some of their fourth quarter gains this occurred as the federal reserve raised rates during the quarter and suggested more nearterm rate hikes might be appropriate the market’s excitement around potential policy changes such as infrastructure spending deregulation and tax reform appeared to fade at the same time concerns around policy uncertainty and signs of a peaking domestic economy weighed on various industries and sectors fund performance for the first quarter of  the westcore smidcap value dividend fund returned  underperforming the  return of its benchmark the russell tm value index our smidcap value strategy faced headwinds in the quarter as more volatile stocks and stocks that don’t pay a dividend did well  contributors to return the fund’s topcontributing sectors relative to its benchmark in the quarter were reits and utilities within reits the fund’s standout performer was prison owner and operator geo group inc the stock continued a strong postelection run as the outlook for federal use of private prisons improved performance was also driven by solid fourth quarter results as well as announcements of several pending opportunities we look for further positive announcements over the next few months as government budgets are appropriated and new leases are able to be signed another strong contributor to the fund’s outperformance in the reit sector was cyrusone inc a data center facility provider for missioncritical data cyrusone recorded solid fourth quarter results that were slightly better than expectations while signed leases were modest given that the company has virtually no space to sell sales were up meaningfully in both cloud and enterprise spaces we expect cyrusone to produce solid cash flow growth as a record number of  leases commence and it begins adding buildtosuit projects to put capital to work at attractive returns goodyear tire  rubber co a developer manufacturer and distributor of tires and related products was another topcontributing holding for the quarter a continuation of favorable us tire industry trends and a volatile commodity environment that was wellmanaged by the company led to financial results that met expectations although our thesis remains intact and management is executing well we trimmed the fund’s position in the quarter given the share price strength detractors from return the sectors that detracted most from the fund’s performance relative to its benchmark were interest rate sensitive medicalhealthcare and technology amtrust financial services inc a provider of insurance services primarily to small businesses was the fund’s largest detractor within the interest rate sensitive sector the company reported  results that were very much in line with our expectations but disappointed the market by announcing the delay of its annual report the delay was due to questions regarding the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses we expect this to have a relatively limited impact on reported earnings and more importantly no impact on cash flows generic pharmaceutical and ingredient producer aceto corp was the fund’s main detractor in the medicalhealthcare sector the market’s downward revision of expectations for generic drug pricing along with aceto’s financial results missing expectations led to the company’s underperformance we believe little has changed within its product filing pipeline and think the market is giving very little credit to the company’s stable base business consumer sector holding cato corp a women’s fashions and accessories retailer was another detractor during the quarter past merchandizing missteps by cato’s designsourcing team were magnified due to samestore sales declines in the fourth quarter a weak apparel environment and increased online competition management has taken corrective actions that we believe are in the final stages of implementation cato’s balance sheet remains very strong and inventories are in better shape we believe that the riskreward presents us with an attractive opportunity with easier sales comparisons ahead   outlook and positioning we believe uncertainty regarding the outlook for economic growth will continue and that concerns around successful policy implementation will remain heightened the uncertainty has resulted in a wavering of the postelection market euphoria as questions regarding economic growth and policy changes remain unanswered this coupled with historically high valuations in our opinion is a recipe for continued volatility in this type of an environment we believe any companyspecific disappointments are likely to be severely and often overly punished this would create nearterm pain but also may offer opportunities to invest in companies at prices below what we believe they are worth stock performance  months ended  top  stocks average weight

riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or

below average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same
