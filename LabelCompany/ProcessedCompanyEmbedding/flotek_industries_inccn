citrus oils industrial solvents and flavor and fragrance ingredients although current inventory and crop expectations are sufficient to meet the companys needs to supply its flavor and fragrance business as well as both internal and external industrial markets the market supply of citrus oils has declined in recent years due to the reduction in citrus crops caused by the citrus greening disease this reduced supply has resulted in higher citrus oil prices and increased price volatility the company expects terpene prices to remain elevated for the foreseeable future however the company expects its strong market position to enable it to maintain a stable supply of citrus oils for internal use and external sales the company expects to manage the impact of increasing terpene costs through the development of new product formulations and pricing strategies capital expenditures for continuing operations exclusive of acquisitions totaled  million in  inclusive of  million for the

form q filed with the us securities and exchange commission flotek reported that revenue for the three months ended june   was  million compared to  million for the three months ended june   revenue in the second quarter increased  million when compared to the same period in the previous year during the quarter flotek acquired florida chemical company inc florida chemical as a result of the acquisition florida chemicals financial results for the months of may and june are included in companys consolidated financial statements and provided  million in incremental revenue during the period excluding florida chemical revenue flotek would have reported revenues of  million for the three months ended june   for the three months ended june   the company reported net income of  million or  per common share fully diluted compared to a net income of  million or  per common share fully diluted for the same period in  the second quarter of  was and will continue to be a transformational tipping point in the history of flotek industries said john chisholm chairman president and chief executive officer of flotek not only did flotek classic post the secondbest quarterly revenue in the companys history it also completed the singlemost important acquisition in the companys history in florida chemical not only does the florida chemical combination secure supply of the key ingredient in floteks patented suite of advanced oilfield chemistries it immediately provides a plethora of additional products to floteks already robust chemical technology offerings moreover it expands floteks reach into key consumer markets and provides opportunities to intensify and reinvigorate our commitment to environmental stewardship in the oilfield most importantly i believe it uniquely positions flotek for significant growth for the balance of  and beyond flotek industries inc   media release   august     for immediate release     for comparison purposes net income for the second quarter of  included noncash income of  million related to the change in fair value of warrant liability a result of securities issued in a preferred stock offering in  due to a change in terms of the remaining warrants the company no longer accounts for the securities as derivative instruments with fluctuating value in addition during the second quarter of  the

this release a complete review and discussion of the companys results for the three and sixmonths ended june   can be found in the companys quarterly report on form q filed with the us securities and exchange commission today acquisition of florida chemical on may   the company acquired florida chemical company the worlds largest processor of citrus oils and a pioneer in solvent chemical synthesis and flavor and fragrance applications from citrus oils florida chemical has been an innovator in creating high performance biobased products for a variety of industries including applications in the oil and gas industry the acquisition brings a collection of high performance renewable and sustainable chemistries into the flotek portfolio in both the oil and gas industry as well as the commercial industrial and consumer markets moreover the combination creates a more secure supply of key material inputs for floteks patented advanced chemistry applications for oil and gas drilling completion and production in addition the combination of florida chemicals strong research expertise in biobased citrus molecular chemistry combined with floteks acumen for advanced practical chemistry applications across the hydrocarbon value chain creates a unique opportunity to become the global leader in products that not only stand in support of improved environmental stewardship in the energy industry but more importantly provide superior results for customers when compared to traditional chemical applications that have detrimental ramifications for the environment flotek industries inc   media release   august     for immediate release     our principal rationale for enticing florida chemical into the flotek family was to create certainty of supply for key citrus terpenes that stand in support of floteks advanced cnf ® chemistries added chisholm while we were also attracted to their broader oilfield products as well as their industrial and consumer goods our short time together convinces me that the combination of our two enterprises will produce more robust opportunities for new products revenues and profits than we initially thought would be possible josh snively and his team are worldrenowned for their expertise in the energy space as well as other key industries as we continue to integrate our teams  a process that to date is both smooth and swift  the opportunity to become a global leader in environmentallyfriendly biobased chemical solutions for the energy industry should be the lasting legacy of this strategic business combination in late july flotek filed the required pro forma financials with the us securities and exchange commission in connection with the acquisition of florida chemical select pro forma financial information can also be found in the companys quarterly report filed today with the complete filing available on floteks website at wwwflotekindcom  in conjunction with the filing of pro forma financial statements the company announced it has adjusted its business segment reporting to reflect the acquisition of florida chemical and more precisely describe the companys existing business in addition to floteks three traditional segments a new segment nonenergy chemical technologies has been added to capture florida chemicals nonenergy specialty chemistry business flotek will now report results in four segments        chemical technologies designs develops manufactures packages and markets specialty chemicals some of which hold patent protection used in oil and gas well cementing stimulation acidizing drilling and production activities in this segment also include construction and management of automated material handling facilities and management of loading facilities and blending operations for oilfield services companies        the new segment nonenergy chemical technologies designs develops and manufactures products that are sold to companies in the flavor and fragrance industry and specialty chemical industry these technologies are used by beverage and food companies fragrance companies and companies providing household and industrial cleaning products        drilling technologies rents sells inspects manufactures and markets downhole drilling equipment used in energy mining water well and industrial drilling activities        artificial lift technologies assembles and markets artificial lift equipment including the petrovalve product line of rod pump components electric submersible pumps gas separators valves and other technologies and services that support natural gas oil and coal bed methane production activities flotek industries inc   media release   august     for immediate release     operations update revenue for the three months ended june   was  million compared to  million for the three months ended june   revenue in the second quarter increased  million when compared to the same period in the previous year as a result of the florida chemical acquisition florida chemicals financial results for the months of may and june are included in companys consolidated financial presentation which provided  million in incremental revenue during the period excluding florida chemical revenue flotek would have reported revenues of  million consolidated margins for the threemonths ended june   were  compared to  in the same period in  the modest decline in gross margins was largely the result of a modest shift in product mix in both chemical technologies and artificial lift technologies revenues in the chemical technologies segment for the threemonths ended june   were  million compared to revenues of  million for the threemonths ended june   excluding the incremental revenue provided from the merger chemical technologies segment revenues were relatively flat yearoveryear chemical technologies segment gross margins were  for the threemonths ended june   a decline from  posted in the same period in  the modest change in margins  albeit from record levels  was primarily the result of product mix including moderately lower margin contributions from productionrelated products acquired in the florida chemical acquisition a slowerthananticipated recovery in canada combined with moderation of overall oilfield activity in north america largely explains subdued yearoveryear growth in chemical technologies revenue in the second quarter however the marketing efforts related to the companys core cnf ® chemistries have resulted in a number of important new customer validations in the first six months of the year which should result in increased market penetration in the secondhalf of the year moreover the stability of margins  including modest sequential improvement  is evidence of the impact of improved marketing penetration and continued improvement in input pricing the florida chemical acquisition should provide additional cost benefits in coming quarters while we continued to feel the impact of slow seasonal recovery in canada and more tempered domestic oilfield activity interest in our advanced chemistry and opportunities for new business improved throughout the quarter added chisholm additionally new data presented to clients in recent weeks combined with solid new well data from regions such as the utica and the dj basin have presented new opportunities in recent weeks while we have said that growth in cnf ® technology revenues will be lumpy we believe the secondhalf of the year will provide a host of exciting new opportunities for flotek moreover core margins remain at nearrecord levels a trend we think can continue in the months ahead flotek industries inc   media release   august     for immediate release     nonenergy chemical technologies nect revenue for the quarter ended june   totaled  million this segment the result of the acquisition of florida chemical debuts this quarter with all revenue incremental to the company with no comparable data available nect revenue is primarily driven by demand for dlimonene a citrus terpene derived from the processing of raw citrus oils and other biobased chemistries offered by the company globally to a multitude of industries as well as from citrus isolates produced for the flavor and fragrance industry revenue results are subject to market seasonality and availability of raw materials nect gross margin for the second quarter and year to date periods ended june   was  million or  of revenues the primary drivers of the margin for the nect segment are demand for the companys biobased chemistries and the high value flavor and fragrance isolates the general direction of the citrus oil markets and seasonality of flavor compounds can also impact margin results contribution from the nonenergy chemical technologies segment are from may and june of  the period for which florida chemical results were consolidated with flotek upon closing of the acquisition drilling technologies revenue for the three months ended june   totaled  million relatively unchanged when compared to the yearago period continued market penetration  especially with advanced technologies such as teledrift and the companys drilling motors  provided for relatively strong results especially in an environment that saw an  decline in the us active rig count and increased pricing pressures from competitors improved sales of centralizers float equipment and motor parts and equipment in the northeast bakken and eagle ford regions resulted from more competitive customer pricing due to better material outsourcing new customer contracts and higher sales to existing customers drilling technologies gross margin increased to  up from  compared to the same period in  the increase was primarily due to increased rental pricing minimums on current motor rentals and on nonmotor related rentals and increased service charges with higher margins the technical advances in teledrift and continued improvement in performance of our drilling motors provided the backdrop for stellar performance in our drilling technologies group added chisholm when we layer in incremental benefits from our new stemulator technology and continued improvement in market penetration as a result of our infrastructure investments in oklahoma and north dakota we believe the secondhalf of  should build on the success seen in the second quarter revenue for the artificial lift technologies segment for the quarter ended june   was  million compared to  million for the period ending june   flotek industries inc   media release   august     for immediate release     penetration of new oil markets as well as a modest rebound in the gas workover market provided additional revenue opportunities as have international sales margins in the quarter declined to  from  in the yearago quarter the result of a decline in valve sales into south american markets that hold higherthanaverage margins while i am pleased with what the flotek team has accomplished in the firsthalf of  there is much more for us to achieve in the secondhalf of the year added chisholm that said i am confident that our investment in exceptional people stateoftheart infrastructure and aggressive marketing will serve us well in the coming months we are well positioned to succeed we now must execute as we work tirelessly to create value for flotek shareholders as a result of new market development extrinsic growth opportunities and the development of a highperformance team the companys sales and administrative costs rose during the period sga expenses for the threemonths ended june   were  million compared to  million for the same period in  included in those expenses were approximately  million in total costs related to the acquisition of florida chemical approximately  million in expenses related to the development of new international markets including its joint venture in oman and new opportunities in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and  million in noncash stock compensation expenses sga expenses in second quarter of  also included  million recorded by florida chemical after the acquisition although administrative costs increased in the quarter a significant portion is directly attributable to activities that serve to position flotek for meaningful growth in the future concluded chisholm moreover we are very pleased that the costs associated with the florida chemical acquisition were allin well below our expectations and were fully expensed in the quarter financial metrics depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter ended june   increased by  million or  relative to  this increase for the quarter was primarily attributable to incremental amortization of intangible assets recognized as part of the acquisition of florida chemical  million the remaining increase in the quarter ended june   is due to increased depreciation expenses resulting from capital asset additions during the second half of  unmatched in the first half of  related to the new erp system and new corporate offices interest and other expense for the quarter ended june   decreased by  million or  compared to the same period a year ago the decline in interest expense was primarily due to the repayment of the companys convertible notes of  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  and  million during the first quarter of  flotek industries inc   media release   august     for immediate release     the company recorded an income tax provision of  million for the quarter ended june   corresponding to an effective tax rate of  compared to an income tax provision of  million for the quarter ended june   reflecting an effective tax rate of  the income tax provision was  million corresponding to an effective tax rate of  for the six months ended june   compared to an income tax provision of  million reflecting an effective tax rate of  for the comparable period in  fluctuations in effective tax rates were historically impacted by noncash changes in the fair value of the companys warrant liability permanent tax differences with no associated income tax impact and existing deferred tax asset valuation allowances project updates in may flotek announced its intent to form a joint venture with an affiliate of gulf energy an omani integrated oilfield services concern to develop a chemical production and research effort in the sultanate of oman to serve the middle east and north africa the company is in the final stages of creating the legal joint venture entity finalizing the definitive agreement between the parties and completing the legal transfer of real property into the joint venture entity it is expected that the legal entity will be completed no later than the end of the third quarter providing for the planning and development of the commercial facilities to begin as originally anticipated in the fourth quarter we are enthused by the progress in our relationship with our omani partner and look forward to completing the meticulous process of creating a durable partnership that provides incredible opportunities for both flotek and gulf energy said chisholm we have been very clear that we will not rush into an agreement without a thorough understanding of the structure and with certainty that it will stand to maximize value and minimize risk especially when it is halfway around the world the time and diligence we have spent to ensure those tenets are preserved will result in a better partnership especially for flotek in the chemical technologies product development arena flotek continues to focus on the commercialization of the next generation of cnf ® chemistries the company is involved in a fullscale commercial test of its cnf  and expects to make key decisions regarding marketing strategy in the third quarter early results are encouraging and the company believes the product should have commercial impact in the secondhalf of  in addition and as a direct result of the acquisition of florida chemical flotek is in the nascent stages of an aggressive marketing plan to replace the use of xylene and related petrochemical solvents in oil and gas production through the development of citrusbased nontoxic chemistries the company believes it has replacement products that provide effective alternatives to xylene with little marketing flotek recorded revenues of approximately  million in sales of the alternative product in july the combination of flotek and florida chemical is no better represented than in our successful quest to create alternatives to btex solvents used in oil and natural gas production added chisholm we are in the very early innings of defining this vast market and best understanding how to capture share however given our safe and effective alternative we are confident that this product will transform the way producers view oilfield solvents and should become a major product in floteks portfolio of advanced oilfield chemistries flotek industries inc   media release   august     for immediate release     in the drilling technologies group the company continues to tweak the commercial offering of its new downhole agitation technology the stemulator in addition to improving drilling performance in horizontal wells the stemulator will add the ability to monitor and record downhole performance various sizes of the stemulator are in production and should provide commercial revenues for the company in the secondhalf of  while largely in the shadow of the companys chemistry and downhole technology offerings the companys artificial lift segment should see meaningful growth in the secondhalf of the year through increased installations of its traditional products in oilier basins as well as the introduction of new products including new lift systems and other components the transformation of our artificial lift business is nothing short of remarkable and is the result of a focus on new technologies that have resulted from our careful assessment of market dynamics added chisholm we expect nearly half of our artificial lift technologies revenue to come from oilbased projects in  a marked change from only  in  while still a relatively small part of our overall technology portfolio those who work in that business believe they will make a much larger contribution in the quarters and years to come floteks oilfield technology innovations are supported by an infrastructure portfolio that is quickly becoming the benchmark for the industry the companys  million capital budget includes completion of production storage and transportation enhancements to the companys primary chemistry production facility in marlow oklahoma the construction and development of a stateofthe art technology facility for teledrift cavo motors and floteks other drilling technologies in moore oklahoma the construction of a new facility to house the companys expanding operations in north dakotas williston basin expansion of florida chemicals storage capacity in waller texas the development of expanded laboratory facilities in the woodlands to support the combination of flotek and florida chemicals advanced chemistry research production of new stemulator tools and capital for expansions to meet growth in nonenergy chemistry technologies facilities in florida and in enhanced oil recovery infrastructure while these results are a report of what we have done in the past we are singularly focused on what the future holds for flotek concluded chisholm we have worked hard to position our company for future success and we believe our future begins today we will focus on execution efficient growth to maximize profits and continue to find ways to invest in our future to create value for you our shareholders we look forward to the journey over the next six months and
