nameemail this iframe contains the logic required to handle ajax powered gravity forms × retail list grow  how to build a large audience and email list for any business… one of the biggest secrets to my business success over the past ten years is an awareness of the business i’m actually in… and what kind of business is that exactly well some people might say that it’s an information publishing business because all of my products have been books and courses on topics that range from personal development to online marketing to investing but in reality i’m actually in the business of building tribes of people who share a common problem or passion i am in the leadership business and my email list of  tribe members is my business’ virtual distribution channel the result is the single greatest lifestyle business that you can ever build for yourself in fact here’s why you want to build a large list and a following as soon as possible… when you have a list you basically have a business that is based around your biggest passion in life and your primary job is to simply engage with and help other people from around the world who share that same passion you can run this kind of business without any employees or an office and you can do it from anywhere in the world when you have a list you can literally make income on demand by sending a single email and as your list continues to grow that income potential becomes absolutely incredible and when you have a list everything you do in business in the future becomes incredibly easy because you have a builtin following of fans customers and supporters for example when i started the self made man podcast recently it became the  show in itunes in the health and self help categories within  hours how simple… i just emailed my list and told them about it having a large list and a tribe of supporters is the ultimate advantage in business but… in order to enjoy the benefits that this kind of business can provide you have to build your tribe and build your list i started building my first list  when i was in my mid’s teaching entrepreneurs how to use attraction marketing strategies to build their businesses within  months i was able to go from deadbroke and waiting tables to making my first million dollars by the age of  within the next two years that list would grow to more than  people which generated an average monthly revenue stream of more than  per month or  million per year in  i my passion had turned towards finance and investing i didn’t know much about the subject but it’s all that i ever talked about so i started a new business in that niche thanks to my existing tribe and list that business acquired over  new customers made over  million it it’s first  days without spending a single dime on advertising by the end of the first year we’d made over  and my list had grown to more than  people and over the past  years my lists and the incredibly relationship i’ve built with my readers have produced more than  in revenue obviously it goes without saying that having that level of financial success has been great but what’s really mattered most is the lifestyle that this kind of business can provide you with which is a life of complete freedom there are some really big moments in my highlight reel that i’m incredibly grateful for like spending two weeks on necker island with richard branson or racing in the mint  with patrick dempsey or having the freedom to live in aspen for two months every summer… but what this business has provided that i’m most grateful for over the years has been the little things… like having the freedom to wake up every morning whenever i want or buying food and clothes without ever having to look at the price tag or having the ability to provide substantial support to causes that i care about like the make a wish foundation and charity water so if there is a blessing that i could pass on to others in my life it would how to create the

dillard scam  fraud alert assign a primary menu you are here home »video » mike dillard scam – fraud alert mike dillard scam – fraud alert october    product reviews     video  by jonathan register   comments is it a mike dillard scam or is mike dillard a legit dude who puts out real products and services that live up to what they say they are going to do i don’t know about you but i hate throwing away money for products and services that are total bs and don’t live up to their claims you’re not going to want to buy any of mike dillard’s products before reading this blog post on this page i’ll answer the question of if it’s a “mike dillard scam” and i’ll give you my experience with his products i’ll also go into the elevation group and whether that’s something you should pursue or avoid is mike dillard a fraud – mike dillard scam mike dillard scam from my research and my experience with mike dillard’s products i can honestly say that it’s not a mike dillard scam and he is not a fraud or anything else crazy like that there have been two products in particular that i have bought and personally used that mike dillard put together both of them did exactly what they said they were going to do and gave me some pretty dramatic results one of the products black belt recruiting really had a profound impact on my network marketing business i even had an “aha” moment as a result of going through the course that literally helped to change the course of my business it took me from an amateur network marketer to a professional following the techniques inside of black belt recruiting i went from struggling to sponsor people into my network marketing business to sponsoring  reps in only  weeks the other product by mike dillard that i have used and have had success with which shows me it’s not a mike dillard scam is his magnetic sponsoring course this course revolves around the use of a technique called attraction marketing to enable a network marketer to attract new reps into their network marketing business versus chasing family friends coworkers etc if you’re new to the network marketing industry then this is a must have book since it teaches you a concept that most network marketing companies aren’t teaching their distributors attraction marketing works plain and simple and mike dillard’s book does a great job explaining it and breaking it down so again from my experience i can say without a doubt that it’s not a mike dillard scam he’s not a fraud and he does put out legitimate products and services if that’s the case then why are there still people out there who say it’s a “mike dillard scam” or asking “is mike dillard a fraud” let me explain… why people say it’s a mike dillard scam the biggest reasons why people jump the gun and say it’s a mike dillard scam is usually because of the hype surrounding his products the upsells and from not reading the terms and conditions or understanding what they are signing up for like every entrepreneur mike dillard uses marketing and affiliates to get as many eyeballs as possible in front of his products in hopes that people will pull the trigger and make a purchase to market these products he’ll obviously hype them up as much as he legally can to get people to buy he’ll make claims about the products and a lot of time people will assume that it’s too good to be true and therefore it’s a mike dillard scam again from what i’ve seen and my experience with his products they do in fact work and live up to the claims the upsells – mike dillard scam if you buy a product from mike dillard you need to expect to be offered additional products or “upsells” immediately after you finalize your order why does he do that and does that make it a mike dillard scam absolutely not but a lot of people make that assumption after seeing the upsells by offering upsells he’s just being a good marketer so he can maximize what he makes just like every good retailer does just think about how many times you’ve been at the check out counter at a clothing store or any other store and the cashier has offered you to buy y because you bought x or think about all of the stuff that surrounds the cash register or the shelves of products you stand by as you’re waiting in line to check out these are all upsells and an effort by the retailer to get you to buy more stuff does that make the retailer a scam and makes it a mike dillard scam no they are just trying to maximize their profits like any entrepreneur should do not reading the terms  conditions – mike dillard scam this is another big reason people automatically assume it’s a mike dillard scam they skim through the sales page they zoom right past the terms and conditions and bam they order the product by doing that they failed to notice that the product is a subscription product where you get charged monthly to be a member then when their credit card gets charged again they automatically assume it’s a mike dillard scam and point the fingers at him take the time to carefully read what you’re buying i do feel that if you’re signing up for a subscription based service that it clearly be stated but you need to make sure you read the terms  conditions so you know what you’re signing up for i personally have not seen instances where mike dillard has hidden the fact that it’s a monthly subscription more specifically the elevation group membership the elevation group fraud – mike dillard scam the elevation group fraud the elevation group fraud – i get a lot of people asking me that so i wanted to address that here too i personally have not purchased a membership to the elevation group but i do have a good buddy who is a member he has stuck with the membership for quite some time now and from what he tells me it has been totally worth it the elevation group is all about how to invest your money properly during these crazy economic times so that in the end you come out ahead if you personally have experience with the elevation group then make sure to leave a comment below since i’d love to hear your thoughts on it the elevation group fraud from what i’ve seen it doesn’t appear so but i’d love to hear your experience with it if i do get the elevation group membership i’ll update this section with my thoughts and experience you need to decide for yourself – mike dillard scam i hope you see now that it’s not a mike dillard scam from my experience with his products they truly do provide a ton of value and they live up to what they are supposed to do i know mike dillard stands behind all of his products and that he lives up to any money back guarantees that he offers so my recommendation would be to pull the trigger so you can be the judge if it’s a mike dillard scam or not i hope you got some value out of this blog post if you did then make sure to leave a comment below and tell me your experience good and bad with mike dillard’s products related posts my lead system pro scam – is mlsp another

the problem as you stated most people that sign up think thier going to get rich quick and don’t pay any attention to what’s being said mike in no uncertain terms says that he is not a finacial adviser this is a documentry of his finacial education in this economy as well as giving those that want too the resources to follow and educate themselves in financial matters to invest and protect

sorry i just wanted to say the most hippie thing possible lol reply name email website comment cancel david says october   hi jonathan i wanted to ask you a question related to the magnetic sponsoring course first off i own this course since two months ago aprox but i have an inquiry about the backoffice of this product is it possible for any people who have this product to brand themselves or not i’m asking this because i know all the people that i could bring to the ms sales funnel are going to “feed” mike dillard’s autoresponders with their names not my own autoresponder in these order of ideas i wanted to know if at least i could import all my prospects names into my own autoresponder because only in that way i’m going to have much control over those prospects that is my straightforward question thanks in advance reply name email website comment cancel ferenc says october   i’m an elevation group member it is not a fraud or scam i’m fully satisfied with what i’m getting although i live in europe and not everything that works in the us works here but i can utilize s percent it is good value for money one thing everyone should note you have to work hard to reach your goal just becoming a member won’t make you rich there is no secret spell that will make you rich… if that is what you are looking for it is the wrong spot reply name email website comment cancel aristodis says october   thank you johnathan it is a useful article i know mike dillard’s works i watched free videos of “black belt recruiting” and “magnetic sponsoring” the only reason why i

recommended products guest post contact john home blogging infographics social media network marketing tips personal development recommended products guest post contact john blogging infographics social media network marketing tips personal development products the secret software mike dillard used to build his online empire… it’s free john engle   comments shares          ok as promised i am going to reveal mike dillard’s secret weapon that he has used on a daily basis to achieve amazing results in his business it is a piece of software found on every computer that has helped him build his entire online empire brickbybrick daybyday… mike dillard’s secret weapon for results no it’s not dreamweaver or an autoresponder to begin… mike makes it clear that there are two kinds of people in the network marketing industry… those that do and those that don’t i am referring to people that make things happen and those that sit around waiting for results here’s what i mean… many people have noticed over the years that mike has one particular trait that has enabled him to achieve great results he says that he is no smarter than the next guy has not had greater opportunities or had more money to begin with he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth what makes mike different from others we can borrow the slogan from nike ‘just do it’ every time mike has an idea he doesn’t sit around and think about it he steps outside the box and just goes for it he says “i just took it for granted that if you have a great idea you freaking do it right” the big difference is that most people including myself may have a little procrastination flowing through our veins we often come up with an amazing idea and think about putting it into action but either talk ourselves out of it or procrastinate to the point that it becomes a distant memory days weeks months go by before we realize that we are still sitting in the same position we were a year ago mike doesn’t think about it he just does it when he has an idea he begins executing it one babystep at a time each and every day until his project is complete success is a matter of habitual behaviors success is not a destination it’s the result of a pattern of habitual behaviors true or false you can take someone who has a track record of success in one field and move them over to another with the expectation that success will be achieved again true why is this it’s not the job or the business opportunity it’s not that the marketing system is greater or the product is better at creating success it’s their daily habits… they are the “doers” there are successful and unsuccessful people in every business – they are all using the same tools the same websites and the same system… the difference is found in their daily habits so how can you transition from a “thinker” to a “doer” mike dillard’s secret weapon revealed this little easy to use software has been crucial in creating mike’s habitual patterns for getting things done which has produced millions of dollars in revenue in the process ever hear of ‘wordpad’ also known as notepad or textedit for mac users here is a simple easy to use program that opens up with a blank white page as it stares at you waiting to be called into action all you do is type into this little unassuming simple program that doesn’t do anything but interpret your key strokes… it doesn’t even check your spelling here is why mike says this little unevolved program is so valuable… it is your new boss every night before mike goes to bed he pulls up his wordpad file which he says that he has saved as his “todotxt” list and he writes down  tasks that he must complete the following day in order of importance in fact here is his actual “to do list” for today to do list write and send ms newsletter update adwords campaign run new headline splittest finish chapter  in “building on a budget” return prospect phone calls and emails why making a written list is so magical when you make a list the night before you will subconsciously have all night to think about it when you awake you are already on task you already know what your goals are for the day you are starting this day with focus and a purpose that is already laid out for you this allows you to ignore the onslaught of distractions that arise each new morning you will find that if you don’t have your todo list waiting for you at your desk in the morning you will get sidetracked with the everyday hustle and bustle life happens… it gets in the way if you don’t take back control and focus it will prevent you from accomplishing anything constructive this is a deadly trap that you must avoid at all costs this happens to be the roadblock that is preventing you from achieving the results that you want the process of creating a todo list each and every night has allowed mike to create his magnetic sponsoring empire his most sophisticated and effective marketing system in the industry was created one step at a time using his little known secret software program called wordpad here’s my challenge to you… make a commitment to use mike’s method for  days starting tonight before you head off to bed create a todo list of  tasks that you must complete by the end of the following day they must be action ‘tasks’ not goals if you do the tasks your goals will automatically be heading in the direction of accomplishment do not put… sponsor a new rep get a new customer read a book etc… if sponsoring a new rep or new customer for your business is your goal then focus on the tasks that will result in the goal like producing  new leads and contacting previous prospects example todo list… send out a press release send a newsletter to my list write an article and submit to  article sites talk to at least  prospects read chapter  in “review  modules in traffic formula ii” if you follow this without fail for the next  days you will be a different person you will have made more progress in one month than you will have in the past  months this is exactly how you execute traffic building methods revealed in courses like magnetic sponsoring for maximum results  suggested reading –  things rich

infographics social media network marketing tips personal development products the secret software mike dillard used to build his online empire… it’s free john engle   comments shares          ok as promised i am going to reveal mike dillard’s secret weapon that he has used on a daily basis to achieve amazing results in his business it is a piece of software found on every computer that has helped him build his entire online empire brickbybrick daybyday… mike dillard’s secret weapon for results no it’s not dreamweaver or an autoresponder to begin… mike makes it clear that there are two kinds of people in the network marketing industry… those that do and those that don’t i am referring to people that make things happen and those that sit around waiting for results here’s what i mean… many people have noticed over the years that mike has one particular trait that has enabled him to achieve great results he says that he is no smarter than the next guy has not had greater opportunities or had more money to begin with he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth what makes mike different from others we can borrow the slogan from nike ‘just do it’ every time mike has an idea he doesn’t sit around and think about it he steps outside the box and just goes for it he says “i just took it for granted that if you have a great idea you freaking do it right” the big difference is that most people including myself may have a little procrastination flowing through our veins we often come up with an amazing idea and think about putting it into action but either talk ourselves out of it or procrastinate to the point that it becomes a distant memory days weeks months go by before we realize that we are still sitting in the same position we were a year ago mike doesn’t think about it he just does it when he has an idea he begins executing it one babystep at a time each and every day until his project is complete success is a matter of habitual behaviors success is not a destination it’s the result of a pattern of habitual behaviors true or false you can take someone who has a track record of success in one field and move them over to another with the expectation that success will be achieved again true why is this it’s not the job or the business opportunity it’s not that the marketing system is greater or the product is better at creating success it’s their daily habits… they are the “doers” there are successful and unsuccessful people in every business – they are all using the same tools the same websites and the same system… the difference is found in their daily habits so how can you transition from a “thinker” to a “doer” mike dillard’s secret weapon revealed this little easy to use software has been crucial in creating mike’s habitual patterns for getting things done which has produced millions of dollars in revenue in the process ever hear of ‘wordpad’ also known as notepad or textedit for mac users here is a simple easy to use program that opens up with a blank white page as it stares at you waiting to be called into action all you do is type into this little unassuming simple program that doesn’t do anything but interpret your key strokes… it doesn’t even check your spelling here is why mike says this little unevolved program is so valuable… it is your new boss every night before mike goes to bed he pulls up his wordpad file which he says that he has saved as his “todotxt” list and he writes down  tasks that he must complete the following day in order of importance in fact here is his actual “to do list” for today to do list write and send ms newsletter update adwords campaign run new headline splittest finish chapter  in “building on a budget” return prospect phone calls and emails why making a written list is so magical when you make a list the night before you will subconsciously have all night to think about it when you awake you are already on task you already know what your goals are for the day you are starting this day with focus and a purpose that is already laid out for you this allows you to ignore the onslaught of distractions that arise each new morning you will find that if you don’t have your todo list waiting for you at your desk in the morning you will get sidetracked with the everyday hustle and bustle life happens… it gets in the way if you don’t take back control and focus it will prevent you from accomplishing anything constructive this is a deadly trap that you must avoid at all costs this happens to be the roadblock that is preventing you from achieving the results that you want the process of creating a todo list each and every night has allowed mike to create his magnetic sponsoring empire his most sophisticated and effective marketing system in the industry was created one step at a time using his little known secret software program called wordpad here’s my challenge to you… make a commitment to use mike’s method for  days starting tonight before you head off to bed create a todo list of  tasks that you must complete by the end of the following day they must be action ‘tasks’ not goals if you do the tasks your goals will automatically be heading in the direction of accomplishment do not put… sponsor a new rep get a new customer read a book etc… if sponsoring a new rep or new customer for your business is your goal then focus on the tasks that will result in the goal like producing  new leads and contacting previous prospects example todo list… send out a press release send a newsletter to my list write an article and submit to  article sites talk to at least  prospects read chapter  in “review  modules in traffic formula ii” if you follow this without fail for the next  days you will be a different person you will have made more progress in one month than you will have in the past  months this is exactly how you execute traffic building methods revealed in courses like magnetic sponsoring for
