incorporated by reference in its entiretybackgroundsecurity systems are typically installed in new structures using wired communication from door and window switches to a central control unit a common sensor for detecting an open door or window is a reed switch having a magnet on a movable member eg the window frame or door frame however such installations are costly when retrofitting a security system in a house or structure wired methods are even more expensive to install because there is no easy access to the underlying wall structurewireless security systems are available and also include a sensor eg a reed switch and magnet and a wireless transmitter however such wireless security systems require that the sensor be placed on a door or window to detect an open condition such sensors may be unreliable due to the wired connection to the transmitter additionally the wireless transmitter requires mounting which may be conspicuous these systems include a transmitter that detects an open window or door via the sensor and transmits the status indeed the status is transmitted for both an open and closed condition of the door or window moreover the absence of the wireless signal indicates that the sensor or transmitter has been tampered withdetecting whether or not there is a disturbance of a portal feature such as a window treatment or blind is useful for safety purposes for example in a child safety application a homeowner may desire a system that detects whether or not a portal feature eg a window or a blind has been disturbed rather than one that only detects whether an intrusion has taken place in such safety applications a child or pet may play with or otherwise disturb a portal feature a user eg a parent or caretaker desires to be alerted to such an event eg a disturbance so that appropriate action can be takenbrief description of the drawings the features and inventive aspects of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following

detection systemfig  shows plan views of a first embodiment and a second embodiment of a separable antenna systemfig  is a front elevational view of the second embodiment of fig  including a window covering in an undisturbed statefig  is a front elevational view of the embodiment shown in fig  wherein the window covering is in a disturbed statedetailed description the embodiments disclosed herein generally concern using wireless transponders to monitor one or more openings or portals of an enclosure such as a house a room a vehicle or the like a wireless transponder is attached to a window covering a window sash a door or other movable portal feature along with a shield on an adjacent stationary feature such as a window sill or frame a reader is provided to communicate with the transponder to detect an intrusion or a disturbance as discussed herein a portal is a general opening such as a door a window and a portal may include a portal feature such as an accessory for the portal for example a portal feature may include a window a door a window treatment a covering a blind a shade a screen a storm door or the like a portal feature may include structures near to within adjacent to or at least partially covering a portion of a portal the portal feature may also include any feature within or covering a portal that is intended to be selectively movable open or closedthe transponder may be on the stationary feature and the shield on a movable portal feature a typical installation includes a radio frequency identification rfid transponder connected to a window treatment and in proximity to a shield that blocks radio frequency rf transmissions wien the movable portal feature is moved such as when an intruder may open a window or a child may explore the area the transponder is moved away or separated from the shield or the shield is moved away from the transponder and the transponder then indicates the disturbed nature of the portal by an rf transmission to the readera disturbance as discussed herein generally describes a movement or upsetting of a steady state condition of a portal a portal feature andor a window treatment etc for example a disturbance may be caused by wind or physical interaction that may cause movement of the transponder shield antenna portal portal feature window treatment andor other related elements that may inhibit or provide for the transmission of a signal from the transponder thus the disturbance is generally defined as generic language that indicates a movement of an element of the systems described herein moreover as discussed in detail herein a transponder may be mounted to a bottom rail of a window treatment and a shield may be mounted to a window sill a disturbance of the window treatment will also disturb the transponder attached to the bottom rail where the disturbance is great enough to move the bottom railthe disclosed embodiments are capable of detecting a disturbance to a portal which includes the portal opening closing or simply an amount of movement of a portal treatment such as the blinds moving on a window as such the disclosed embodiments are useful for a wide variety of applications including child safety for example a child or pet may play with or otherwise disturb a portal feature and a user such as a parent or caretaker may desire to be alerted to such an event so that appropriate action can be takenin an embodiment in an undisturbed state the transponder does not transmit an rf signal to the reader because the shield prevents rf transmissions in alternative embodiments an rf signal is present indicating an undisturbed state where a passive rfid transponder is used the shield further prevents the transponder from receiving an rf transmission from the reader and as such prevents the passive transponder from receiving and responding to the readers rf transmission in an undisturbed state ie a secure state the reader does not sense the presence of the transponder the movement of the window window treatment or door exposes the transponder and the presence of a signal from the transponder triggers the detection of an unauthorized accessin an alternative embodiment the transponder transmits an rf signal to the reader in an undisturbed state thus in an undisturbed state ie a secure state the reader senses the presence of the transponder the movement of the window window treatment or door prevents the transponder from transmitting a signal or at least an rf signal strong enough to reach the reader and the absence of a signal from the transponder triggers the detection of an unauthorized accessas discussed herein radio frequency identification rfid refers generally to an identification technology developed for identifying objects however it is understood that the discussion of the embodiments including rfid components may also use other suitable wireless technologies including for example radio frequency and infrared communications rfid communications are performed between a reader eg an rfid interrogator or reader and a transponder eg an rfid tag or rfid transponder the reader is a fixed or mobile unit that is capable of receiving signals from the transponder the transponder is typically an inexpensive fixedpurpose device that may include digitally encoded information for identification purposesthe receiver is typically embodied as a transceiver that both transmits and receives radio frequency signals the reader includes an antenna and queries and receives information from the transponder the reader may also power the transponder where passive transponders are used explained below in detail and may include a processor for performing operations eg sending information to another station indicating the presence of a transponder signaltransponder types may include passive or semipassive types a passive transponder does not include an onboard power supply eg a battery and is powered by rf transmissions from the reader moreover passive transponders are typically very small and thin eg approximately the size of a postage stamp because passive transponders do not include a power supply which degrades over time the passive transponders typically have an unlimited useful life a semipassive or active transponder includes an onboard power supply eg a battery that self powers the transponder circuitry and allows for more sophisticated communication sessions with the reader semipassive transponders typically only use the onboard power for an outgoing transmission additionally each transponder may be programmed with a code for identification purposes the code may be the same which is used to identify a group of transponders or the code may be unique in which case each particular transponder is identified explained ill detail below with respect to fig fig  is an interior view of a window  and window treatment  for use with an embodiment window  is considered a portal and generally embodies any location or aperture that would allow unauthorized access or egress window  includes a window frame  and a window sill  window treatment  includes a head rail  a bottom rail  and an actuator  head rail  is connected to window frame  at the top portion actuator  is typically a pull cord having a tassel and allows for movement of bottom rail  to extend or retract window treatment  the movement of window treatment  in response to the actuator is shown with the double arrow ie the movement is up and downfig  is a perspective view of window treatment  and bottom rail  according to an embodiment window treatment  is shown for example as a double cellular fabric bottom rail  is metallic and includes a face extension  a base plate  and a cavity  although described here as metallic bottom rail  may be constructed in any manner cooperating to prevent lowpower rf transmissions described below in detail with respect to fig  face extension  extends below base plate  such that cavity  is formed below base plate  cavity  is surrounded on three  sides by face extensions  and base plate fig  is a perspective view of a detection transponder arrangement  including window treatment  bottom rail  a transponder  and shield  for use with the embodiment of fig  in one embodiment transponder  may be affixed to base plate  in cavity  alternatively transponder  may be affixed to shield  it is also contemplated that other embodiments may include for example affixing transponder  to elements of doors in one embodiment transponder  is provided in a peelable label on window treatment  where it provides tracking of product during manufacture and shipment and is removable for repositioning in a more advantageous location with shield  as determined at installation for best communication with a reader  or for other local benefits including aesthetics or functionalityshield  is typically made of metal and includes raised ears  that cooperate with cavity  to enclose transponder  cavity  is closed on three  sides by face extensions  and base plate  when bottom rail  is lowered proximal to shield  raised ears  and shield  cooperate with bottom rail  to fully enclose transponder  thus transponder  is fully enclosed and cannot transmit rf signals from cavity  to the surrounding environment in effect transponder  is enclosed in a faraday cage when discussed herein the terms shielded enclosed and surrounded as relating to transponder  mean that transponder  is substantially prevented from receiving or transmitting an rf signal beyond the confines of such shield or cage in one embodiment the shielding may result from use of a material eg a metal or a conductive plastic that substantially prevents transponder  from sending an rf signal ie a transmission moreover shielding may be accomplished using a combination of material type andor configuration eg foil sheet that substantially prevents an rf transmission from transponder  in some instances such as when using semipassive transponder  the shielding may also prevent transponder  from receiving a transmission from reader in an embodiment bottom rail  and shield  are made of metal or if bottom rail  is made of wood or other rftransmissive material a metal plate for example is affixed thereto in the location corresponding to the shield  it is also contemplated that other materials may be used to entirely shield transponder  or dampen rf transmissions such that a reader will not properly receive a signal from transponder  for example bottom rail  and shield  may be made of metal conductive plastic conductive mesh or other rf blocking material in other embodiments they may be plastic or wood including a foil to substantially prevent rf communications for example a wooden door that is thick enough to block rf transmissions of a predetermined amplitude or frequency range from an rfid transponderas shown when bottom rail  is not proximal to shield  transponder  is not fully enclosed and may transmit a signal capable of reception by a reader in another embodiment transponder  is positioned on bottom rail  which is movable when window treatment  is fully deployed in a downward position an intrusion through window  or other dislocation of window treatment  will result in movement of bottom rail  and railmounted transponder  away from shield  in this embodiment transponder  attached to bottom rail  becomes unshielded as bottom rail  is separated from shield  in an alternative embodiment if transponder  is mounted on shield  an intrusion through window  or other dislocation of window treatment  will result in movement of extensions  and base plate  away from transponder  in this embodiment transponder  attached to shield  becomes unshielded as bottom rail  is separated from shield  either embodiment results in exposure of transponder  and the emission of a signal that can be received by reader  when bottom rail  is separated from shield  as described herein the embodiments do not require a sensor such as a reed switch and magnet moreover the portal eg window or door is not monitored for its position by a sensor the embodiments do not require transponder  eg an rfid transponder or tag to be attached to any sensor by using a system where the presence or absence of a signal is determined by the position of the transponder relative to a shield no sensors are required rather the absence of a signal or the presence of a signal from transponder  is monitoredgenerally in defining an appropriate distance that shield  is spaced apart from transponder  attached to bottom rail  the distance to prevent a signal from being transmitted is a function of the operating frequency of transponder  the maximum distance to prevent a signal from being transmitted from transponder  is the shortest wavelength of radio frequency transmission used in the system for example according to established allotments of radio spectrum where transponder  operates in a low frequency lf embodiment transponder  operates at about one hundred twenty five  kilo hertz khz to about one hundred thirty five  khz in a high frequency embodiment transponder  operates at about thirteen point five six  mega hertz mhz in an ultra high frequency uhf embodiment transponder  operates at about eight hundred sixty eight  mhz to about nine hundred thirty  mhz alternatively in a microwave embodiment transponder  operates at about two point four five  giga hertz ghz or about five point eight  ghz thus where transponder  is used in a low frequency embodiment the maximum gap in an enclosing faraday cage comprising shield  and bottom rail  and possibly with other secondary shielding elements as required surrounding transponder  to prevent a signal is about two point four  meters mn in a microwave embodiment of about five point eight  ghz the maximum gap in faraday cage including shield  surrounding transponder  to prevent a signal is about point zero five  millimeters mm although examples of maximum gap distances of faraday cage including shield  surrounding transponder  are described above gaps may also be less than the shortest wavelength of radio frequency transmission used in the systemto achieve acceptably small gaps and to avoid inadvertent movement of railmounted transponder  away from shield  thereby opening a transmissive gap in the faraday cage a guiding interlock eg a mechanical interlock or mechanical nest may be used a guiding interlock may be embodied as elements engaged in a frictional or interference fit a tongue and groove or a two part lock separable by a predetermined force in another embodiment transponder  and corresponding shield  or bottom rail  whichever is not attached to transponder each further comprise a magnetic portion eg a bondedmagnetic label such that transponder  is magnetically attracted to bottom rail  or shield  and provides a resistive force to minor movement of window treatment  thus using a guiding interlock or magnetic portions for transponder  false alarms are reduced from windblown motion of window covering  or inadvertent movement due to the motion of a petas discussed above a guiding interlock may be embodied as for example a mechanical or magnetic solution the guiding interlock may be configured to locate transponder  relative to bottom rail  or shield  as shown for example by the fit between ears  and cavity  moreover the guiding interlock may provide a holding force for bottom rail  and shield  typically either by mechanical snapin fit as with wellknown holddown brackets for window treatments mounted on swinging doors or by magnetic attraction the holding force may be calibrated to hold bottom rail  and shield  together under nuisance conditions eg a pet brushing against window treatment  or a short wind gust while allowing bottom rail  and shield  to separate under disturbance from a child or an intrusion moreover where certain window treatments are used for a childs room they may be calibrated with a lower holding force than for example a window treatment in a garagefig  is a perspective view of a detection system in an undisturbed state  ie a secure state according to a first embodiment undisturbed state  includes windows  ′ window treatments  ′ a reader  and reader rf signals  windows  ′ include shields  not shown see fig  on window sills  not shown see fig  window treatments  ′ include bottom rails  and transponders  not shown see fig  as shown window treatments  ′ are fully deployed in a down position such that transponders  are enclosed between shields  and bottom rails  thus reader rf signals  are transmitted by reader  but are not responded to by transponders  because they are enclosed and therefore rf shieldedwhere passive transponders are used transponders  will not receive power reader rf signals  from reader  and even where some power from reader  is received by transponder  transponder  cannot transmit to reader  because of the enclosure where semipassive transponders are used transponder  will not receive a query reader rf signals  from reader  thus battery power is conserved such a system may economically facilitate use of longlife semipassive tags because energy is not expended by transponders  in a secure statefig  is a perspective view of a detection system in a disturbed state  according to the embodiment of fig  here window covering ′ is partially open creating a gap between bottom rail  and shield  thus transponder  in this embodiment affixed to shield  is exposed and allowed to transmit reader rf signals  are received by transponder  and a transponder signal  is transmitted the presence of transponder signal  indicates an insecure or disturbed state in contrast to fig  showing an undisturbed state and without a transmission from transponder  fig  shows a transmission from transponder  that was not present in fig  reader  detects the presence of transponder signal  and indicates an alert status because the room is now determined to be insecure in this way transponder  does not signal reader  until a portal or a portal feature like a window treatment is disturbedin further contrast to undisturbed state  of fig  when window ′ is disturbed window treatment ′ is also necessarily disturbed and a separation occurs between shield  and bottom rail  the disturbance and separation of shield  and bottom rail  allow transponder  to receive power from reader  in the case of a passive transponder or to receive a query from reader  and transmit a response in the case of a semipassive transponderin other embodiments transponders  are integrated with windows  and window treatments  a repeaterreader explained in detail below with respect to fig  may be used that allows for localized security to a room and also a networked security system with other readers  andor repeaterreaders that communicate with each other to determine a secureinsecure status in this way each window and door including a transponder  may act as a wireless security device moreover by using multiple readers and repeaterreaders the indication of an insecure status may be structure or household wide that is to say the indication of an insecure status from one window may be determined by a reader or repeaterreader and retransmitted to the other readers or repeaterreaders or a centralized security system to indicate the insecure statusfig  is a single region diagram  of the system of fig  including multiple transponders af as shown window a is in a disturbed state where shield  is not proximate to bottom rail  such that transponder a is not surrounded and prevented from sending a signal the other transponders bf are not disturbed and are not able to receive or transmit signals however because transponder a is disturbed transponder a receives reader rf signals  and transmits a transponder signal  in response indicating an insecure conditionfig  is a multiple region diagram  including a readerrepeater  according to a second embodiment readerrepeater  includes the capability to send signals to transponders receive signals from transponders and send signals to other readerrepeaters  or readers  the connectivity of readerrepeater  allows for localized reading of transponders  but also provides for centralized communication or indication of a secure or insecure condition a first region  eg a garage may include three  windows ac and the associated window coverings and transponders ac as shown window a is in a disturbed state such that transponder a receives reader rf signals  in this embodiment from a readerrepeater readerrepeater  sends a repeater signal  to reader  that is in a second region while readerrepeater  may be located in first region  the secure or insecure status information may be transmitted to second region  or others by repeater signal  the system including multiple regions and also localized reading of the transponders allows for the use of less costly passive transponders for the portals eg window door etc readerrepeater  locally determines the presence or absence of a transponder signal  and will send a signal or update the status by way of repeater signal as will be understood by those skilled in the art the embodiments including window covering and metallic shields are not the only means to accomplish the aforementioned security embodiments other embodiments include the use of multiple readers  multiple transponders  a mixture of passive transponders and semipassive transponders a mixture of readers  and readerrepeaters  and the use of amplifiers moreover the theory of operation may also be reversed such that the presence of a transponder signal indicates an undisturbed ie secure state and the absence of a transponder signal indicates a disturbed ie insecure state another embodiment may include the use of local amplifiers or antenna arrangements such that the position of the transponder is determined when a change of position of the transponder is sensed for example the window covering is presumed to have been disturbed and an insecure indication is recordedin another embodiment each of transponders ac comprises a unique identifier that is transmitted to reader  and readerrepeater  using the unique identifier reader  readerrepeater  or any other device eg a centralized security system the individual transponder ac disturbed is established thus the unique identifier further allows for a determination of which aperture eg window or door has been disturbed for example where a signal is received and uniquely identified as transponder a readerrepeater  associates the unique identifier with window a thus the system now knows which of windows ac individually or in combination has been disturbedfig  is a process flow  for securing an enclosure the process begins at step  where a user secures the room by shielding transponder  in the embodiment of fig  transponder  is shielded by lowering window treatments  ′ such that transponder  is shielded by shield  and lower rail  for each window  ′ the user may perform this action for any number of windows doors or other portals the process then proceeds to step at step  the user activates reader  such that monitoring of the enclosure is performed by reader  to detect an intrusion or a disturbance reader  may be monitoring a single enclosure or reader  may be connected to other readers  andor readerrepeaters  to secure a plurality of enclosures or a structure comprising a plurality of enclosures eg rooms the process flow then endsfig  is a process flow  for reader  determining the security state of an enclosure in an embodiment transponder  does not communicate with reader  in secure state before the process begins and in normal operation a user would have secured the enclosure as is shown in fig  the process begins at step  where reader  checks for the presence of transponder signal  see fig  above the circuits of reader  typically send out an rf pulse that when passive transponder  is unshielded is reflected or retransmitted including a modulation that is discernable by reader  in this way reader  can determine that transponder signal  is present in another embodiment where a semipassive transponder  is used the rf pulse may trigger semipassive transponder  to transmit another signal which is discernable by reader  the process flow then proceeds to step in step  reader  determines if a signal is present if a signal is not present reader  deems the enclosure secure for example in the embodiment of fig  transponder  is shielded thus transponder signal  is not present eg the enclosure is secured indeed no signal from transponder  is received by reader  however in the embodiment of fig  where a signal is present eg transponder signal  reader  determines that the enclosure is insecure if no signal is present the room is deemed secure and the process flow proceeds to step  and repeats the flow sequence from step  typically after a predetermined interval of time if transponder signal  is present the room is deemed insecure and the process flow proceeds to step in step  reader  indicates that the enclosure is secure such an indication may be a light indicating a secure condition an electrical output signal or the absence of an alarm the process flow then proceeds to step  where reader  continues monitoring for transponder signal in step  the reader indicates that the enclosure is insecure because transponder signal  is received reader  interprets the presence of transponder signal  as a breach of a portal of the enclosure thus an indication of the intrusion or disturbance should be communicated to a user andor another system the insecure indication may be a light indicating an insecure condition an electrical output signal or sounding an alarm moreover reader  may further indicate to other readers  andor readerrepeaters  or a central control that the intrusion or disturbance has occurred the process flow then endsfig  is a process flow  for testing the security system in an embodiment transponder  does not communicate with reader  in secure state the test  begins at step  where a user shields transponder  or multiple transponders  and secures the enclosure the process flow then proceeds to step at step  the user activates reader  to begin monitoring the status of the enclosure the process flow then proceeds to step at step  reader  monitors for an intrusion or a disturbance of the enclosure as described in process flow  above reader  monitors for the absence or presence of an unshielded transponder  indicated by the absence or presence of transponder signal  the process flow then proceeds to step at step  the user unshields transponder  the unshielding can be accomplished by moving window covering ′ such that lower rail  is moved away from shield  and exposing transponder  as shown in fig  this example of unshielding transponder  simulates an intrusion or a disturbance of the enclosure the process flow then proceeds to step at step  the user checks for an indication from reader  that the enclosure is insecure as mentioned above the indication could be a light digital display andor alarm etc if there is an indication that the enclosure is insecure the user knows that the system is properly configured for the particular transponder  that was exposed the user may wish to test each transponder  to verify that the system is working properly for each and every transponder  if there is no indication that the room is insecure the user knows that the system may be improperly configured the process flow then endsfig  shows plan views of a first embodiment  and a second embodiment  of a separable antenna system including a rfid tag  and an antenna  a window sill  holds antenna  and a window covering shown in fig  holds rfid tag  first embodiment  shows antenna  as being located generally centered over rfid tag  second embodiment  shows antenna  as being located generally askew but still overlapping rfid tag  when antenna  is proximal to rfid tag  antenna  behaves to enhance the range of rfid tag  thus when antenna  is located near rfid tag  an interrogation signal such as a signal by reader  shown in fig  rfid tag  is able to respond where antenna  is proximal to rfid tag  the radio frequency coupling allows antenna  to behave as a signal enabler eg an antenna or range extender for rfid tag  in that antenna  provides for the signal being transmitted at a greater range than where rfid tag  is transmitting alone indeed without antenna  rfid tag  is not capable of transmitting beyond a short distance that would require a reader to be proximal to rfid tag  to detect a signal if at allfig  is a front elevational view of the second embodiment  of fig  in an undisturbed state  and used with a window covering  window covering  includes rfid tag  and is not alone able to be interrogated by reader  shown in fig  when antenna  attached to window sill  is proximal to rfid tag  as shown here in fig  rfid tag  is able to send a signal in response to an interrogation signal from reader  due to the radio frequency coupling of antenna  and rfid tag  the signal is generated at rfid tag  and is coupled to antenna  for transmission to the environment thus when window covering  is in an undisturbed state rfid tag  is able to send a signal to reader  shown in fig fig  is a front elevational view of the embodiment shown in fig  and wherein window covering  is in a disturbed state  as shown window covering  is moved sideways such that rfid tag  is separated from antenna  because rfid tag  requires antenna  to be in proximity to communicate with reader  shown in fig  the lack of a signal from rfid tag  signals a disturbed state or an intrusion thus the embodiments described herein with respect to figs  signal intrusion by the lack of a signal from rfid tag  to reader  shown in fig as is also discussed above with respect to fig  to avoid inadvertent movement of rfid tag  from antenna  a guiding interlock eg a mechanical interlock or mechanical nest may be used in an embodiment rfid tag  and antenna  each further comprise a magnetic portion eg a bondedmagnetic label such that rfid tag  and antenna  are magnetically attracted to each other when using a magnetic system the constant magnetic fields from the magnetic portions do not interfere with the fluctuating fields of the radio frequency signals associated with reader  shown in fig  or the response from rfid tag  and antenna  thus using a guiding interlock or attractive magnetic portions for rfid tag  and antenna  false alarms are reduced from windblown motion or movement due to pet motion of window covering in contrast to the embodiments described above with respect to figs  the embodiments described herein with respect to figs  operate to detect an intrusion by the absence of a signal rather than the presence of a signal as described above with respect to figs  in sum the transponder and shield embodiments described in detail above with respect to figs  behave to allow the transponder to send a signal when disturbed and alternatively the rfid tag and antenna embodiment described with respect to figs  behave to prevent the rfid tag from sending a signal when disturbedfor all of the embodiments disclosed herein the radio frequency portion eg transponder  or rfid tag  for each embodiment may be shipped permanently affixed to a product portion eg a rail or a shield or may be added by an installer or user during final installation where the radio frequency component eg transponder  or rfid tag  is desired to be used as an rfid tag for inventory control as well as an element of a security system the rfid tag may be mounted or packaged to allow for an rfid inventory scanner to read the information from the rfid tag however when the rfid tag is to be mounted to a shield such as is described as an alternative in fig  it is desirable to have the rfid tag affixed to the shield during final installation rather than before shipping otherwise the shield may interfere with the rfid inventory scanners interrogation of the rfid tag and prevent the rfid tag being used for inventory control in these cases an in any case where the rfid tag is otherwise shielded or prevented from receiving andor transmitting a peelable multilayer rfid tag is preferred such that the user or installer may peel the unshielded tag away from the packaging and affix it to a shield bottom rail window sill etc during installation see figs  when an rfid tag and antenna are used one or both of rfid and antenna may use peelable multilayer substrates for final assembly by a user or installer in any case such a peelable rfid tag allows for the user or installer to affix the rfid tag at any position eg allows for adjustable positioning of the tag to provide for the best signal to a reader or to achieve a less obtrusive more aesthetically pleasing locationthe present invention has been

shades in the residential greenhouse market from  through  comfortex evolved from a small regional fabricator of greenhouse shades to a national manufacturer of innovative window treatment products the harmony mill site in cohoes new york lent marketing inspiration to the new products comfortex developed symphonyâ® cellular shades serenadeâ„¢ roman shades and woodwindsâ® wood alloy blinds are just some of the product names that were created from a decidedly musical theme the early s presented a changing business landscape in the united states the growing number of big box stores was squeezing independent window treatment retailers into bankruptcy looking for a way to keep its core customer base in business comfortex conceived a retail fabrication program that helped transform these small retailers into mini factories allowing them to easily compete with the national chain stores comfortexs innovative composer program created a new distribution channel which eliminated the middleman for hundreds of small retail businesses worldwide growth and change highlighted the years following comfortex established a plant in melbourne florida to service the southeastern market in  the operation at harmony mills moved to its current  squarefoot modern office and manufacturing complex in maplewood a year later comfortex opened another facility in phoenix arizona to manufacture its patented wood alloy material for the companys innovative line of blinds following the  launch of its shangrilaâ® line of sheer horizontal window shadings comfortex experienced accelerated growth and established a significant international presence spring  brought another addition to the sheer line stardustâ® soft sheer verticals the perfect shangrila companion product in  comfortex expanded its product offering to include woodwindsâ® plantation shutters and harmonyâ„¢ cellular verticals the blindcrafter program was launched during that same year to create a unified comfortex brand for
