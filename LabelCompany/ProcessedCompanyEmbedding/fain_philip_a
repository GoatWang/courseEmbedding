fain to revamp philip johnson’s crystal cathedral by antonio pacheco • september   share proposed renovations to cathedral sanctuary courtesy johnson fain proposed renovations to cathedral balconies courtesy johnson fain proposed renovations to cathedral chapel courtesy johnson fain proposed renovations to cathedral baptistry courtesy johnson fain proposed renovations to cathedral altar courtesy johnson fain this week los angeles–based architects johnson fain revealed their plans for the first phase of upcoming renovations to philip johnson and john burgee’s iconic crystal cathedral in anaheim california the building completed in  and part of a larger religious campus that contains notable structures by richard meier and partners as well as richard neutra will begin renovations this year the iconic structure’s continuous glass panel exterior will be preserved during the renovation a bulk of the new work will pertain to the building’s interior spaces which are being reconfigured and expanded in order to accommodate a larger congregation plans revealed for the renovations include the reorientation of the worship spaces with the existing “antiphonal” arrangement with two singing groups on either side of the main stage being converted into a traditional catholic altar configuration in this arrangement the choir will be located behind the altar with the altar itself pushed forward into the nave of the church a new organ will be located further behind the choir creating a new focal point for the cathedral the new altar will also receive speciallycalibrated devices the firm calls “quatrefoils” that will make for a more efficient distribution of light and forced air in the worship space proposed renovations to cathedral chapel courtesy johnson fain the proposed renovations come after several years of uncertainty for the church the structure was purchased by the roman catholic diocese of orange in  after the crystal cathedral ministries the church’s original congregation declared bankruptcy the building was subsequently rechristened as “christ cathedral” and has been awaiting renovation ever since neutra’s arboretum building a massive drivein church located adjacent to the crystal cathedral structure was renovated in 4 during the public unveiling of the new plans in the cathedral which took place during a daylong 4th anniversary for the complex

johnsons crystal cathedral by julia ingalls dec    pm est  follow crystal cathedral courtesy of johnson fain rendering by shimahara illustration how does one design tangible structures for that most intangible of qualities faith more to the point how does one renovate an existing place of worship to suit a new dogma johnson fain’s renovation of philip johnson and john burgee’s crystal cathedral is the culmination of metaphor media and the historical christian tradition of repurposing  johnson fain is hiring job televangelist robert schuller of the reformed church in america didn’t just have faith but a media savviness he realized in the s that religion like any consumer product could be shared far and wide via new technological mediums schuller briefly held court in a drivein movie theatre where parishioners could get the stereophonic good word in the comfort of their own automobiles he then hired richard neutra to design a religious sanctuary known as the tower of hope for classroom and office space however the church quickly outgrew the tower by the s schuller had engaged the openly secular and gay philip johnson to design a brand new home for his hour of power television show and congregation completed in  in garden grove california the resulting massive glass building would officially become known as the crystal cathedral crystal cathedral courtesy of johnson fain rendering by shimahara illustration during the late s architect scott johnson was employed by philip johnson no relation and spent time working on the design of the glass skin of the crystal cathedral when the roman catholic diocese of orange purchased the building from the bankrupt crystal cathedral ministries in  they asked johnson now one of the partners of johnson fain to renovate a building with which he was already quite familiar the  million dollar renovation is scheduled to be completed in  the building’s official new name is “the christ cathedral” i’m not even certain if they were aware that i had worked for philip johnsonso what was it like to renovate a building he had fleetingly helped to initially design i called scott johnson and asked him if remaking the cathedral presented any personal conflict or if it was merely strange “no conflict—there was no negativity to it—it was your word ‘strange’” he explained as a young man working in new york for philip johnson scott was experiencing an introduction to the profession and the joys of problemsolving he has now lived in los angeles for about thirty years and his new york past had become a distant if pleasant memory until he received a phone call from the roman catholics “it was a little odd or certainly unanticipated when we had calls from the church asking if—and i’m not even certain if they were aware that i had worked for philip johnson i think they were calling johnson fain among some other firms and then i explained to them that they didn’t have to tell me about the building i was plenty familiar with it if they wanted to talk about where this building fit in with philip johnson’s chronology of work i could tell them that too so that was entertaining actually”  crystal cathedral photo courtesy of roman catholic diocese of orange what’s striking about the renovation is the meticulous balance johnson fain has achieved between respecting the original intent of the building while meeting the needs of its new owners i wondered how the process of transforming a nontraditional worship space into a roman catholic orientation had unfurled“we went through several design phases” johnson told me “at one point we were looking at an antiphonal situation where the altar would be in the center of the space the building plan as you probably know is a long diamond east to west you enter on the south so it’s a very wide building and a fairly shallow building which is of course the opposite of a roman catholic basilica or cathedral which tends to be long in the nave and then narrow in the transepts that was an interesting characteristic of the building to adapt to roman catholic cathedral” eventually johnson fain decided to orient the altar so it was sited off center to the north so the parishioner seats would radiate around it thereby allowing a priest to administer to everyone without ever turning his back on anyone  crystal cathedral photo courtesy of roman catholic diocese of orange however the most inventive architectural element within the design is the quatrefoil a translucent cloth window application that mitigates light heat and acoustical problems the church’s allglass exterior and lack of indoor cooling could make sitting in the pews during the summer an excruciating sunintensive experience meanwhile the physical length of the church gave rise to a problematic two to four second frequency period for music and speeches but how would these issues be resolved while preserving the iconic glass exterior  crystal cathedral courtesy of johnson fain rendering by shimahara illustration “the issue was how to contain this roman catholic church which historically has been masonry while we have a completely glassy space” johnson said “as we were charting and identifying the technical problems we were also looking for an attitude another layer to respond to the enclosure system that philip and schuler had created there was the idea that looking out to the sky was the heavens but there were many metaphors for heavens and so i basically developed the quatrefoil which is a triangular section of light fabric that’s translucent it’s not opaque” in a metaphoric way they are still like the heavens or the sky or the universeusing a computer johnson fain mapped all the panes of glass and then did a multiseason glare study this allowed them to decide how to best distribute the quatrefoils both metaphorically and pragmatically “the quatrefoils are random so when you look up at them they’re the seeming randomness of the stars in the sky so in a metaphoric way they are still like the heavens or the sky or the universe but in a different way in a sense we built a ship inside a ship or a building inside of a building i didn’t want to do anything to the exterior of the building it’s largely identifiable by people from all over the world it’s pretty much celebrated that was an important part of philip johnson and john burgee’s career we wanted it to be the identifier of the project so we’re in the process of restoring that but once you enter everything has changed as if it’s a new building within an older building” crystal cathedral courtesy of johnson fain rendering by shimahara illustration this notion of the past being contained within the present is not merely an echo of johnson’s personal history to the building but the larger tradition of christian worship structures in general johnson related to me a brief history of christian gatherings first they met in burial sites like the catacombs and then upgraded to basilicas some of which began as roman spas eventually roman catholics started to develop their own architectural lineage but as johnson reflected “the roman catholic story is about occupying spaces that they didn’t necessarily initially conceive so it didn’t seem like a far conceptual stretch to say ‘we have this building and it was for an evangelical proministry in the s and s but now it’s a roman catholic cathedral how do we do that’” crystal cathedral courtesy of johnson fain rendering by shimahara illustration looked at one way the christ cathedral is a tame if pragmatically innovative renovation of an iconic structure that was initially meant to push past the boundaries of old school religious thinking once the temple of a television preacher the cathedral now emphasizes a connection with a deity who will not be televised all the same johnson was philosophical about the value of repurposing spaces and the associated conceptual challenges “it’s a good architectural problem to use something that was there and has value and insert your own new day in a way that’s still friendly to the old” johnson told me “i think we as our cities densify that’s the kind of problem we have to think about a lot you want to do something in your own time in your way with your own program to be relevant at the same time you have this remnant this earlier ancestor and you don’t want to destroy it you want to elevate it and acknowledge it that’s a good kind of conceptual problem” this feature is part of archinects december editorial theme faith similar articles on
