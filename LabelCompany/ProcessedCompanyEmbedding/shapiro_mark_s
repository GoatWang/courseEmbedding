business and technical problems and of course why your offering is best suited to solve those problems inbound contentdriven marketing provides maximum effectiveness to reach every stakeholder at every stage of the buying cycle with relevant contextual information it allows you to be very targeted and customercentric in your approach and you probably already know this which is why you’ve purchased or are considering purchasing a marketing automation platform hubspot pardot marketo eloqua acton etc are all fantastic tools for implementing inbound content driven marketing however there is no denying that it takes time effort and most importantly an understanding of how your buyers make purchasing decisions for marketing automation to be effective you need to understand what your buyers challenges are and how your offerings address those challengesand then provide them with content that clearly articulates this marketing automation platforms run on content it’s the fuel that runs the marketing automation engine if you don’t have great content then marketing automation won’t help you if you don’t have the time or expertise to develop great content then marketing automation won’t help you if your message is focused only on your product and what it does then you won’t develop great content if you don’t understand who is buying your product not just who is using it and how they make their buying decisions then you won’t have great content and it wont reach the right people i know technology marketing and will work with you to  develop messaging  positioning and high

shapiro phd research interests what are ion channels  the nervous system is a vast array of connected cells called neurons which are responsible for organizing and directing the activities of all animals the heart is composed of cardiomyocytes that are electrically connected to control and sustain the cardiovascular system smooth muscle cells control the tone of blood vessels and airways these neurons cardiomyocytes and muscle cells work by using a combination of electrical and chemical signals the electrical signals use the charged salt atoms ions of body fluids that are our heritage of evolving from the sea the movement of ions in and out of cells is mediated by ion channels macromolecular proteins that span the lipid membranes of cells and selectively permit the passage of particular ions the ionic currents carried by ion channels underlie the basic electrical signals that allow the nervous and cardiovascular systems to function we are interested in the physiology regulation and functional role of ion channels   many signaling pathways modulate ion channelssince ion channels are so critical to the function of excitable cells a vast system of neurotransmitters and hormones regulate the physiology of excitable cells by acting on specific receptors in the cell membrane the intracellular actions of these receptors are often mediated by g proteins biological molecular switches that transduce the extracellular presence of a neurotransmitter into the modulation of some intracellular target in neurons and cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells as well as many other types of cells these g proteinmediated signaling pathways frequently act on ion channels our laboratory focuses on these gprotein signaling pathways that act on two important types of ion channels the first makes an important neuronal k current called the m current called such because it is strongly modulated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists the genes underlying m currents have been identified and several different subunits of the kcnq kv k channel family consisting of kcnq kv come together to form mtype k channels the second are voltagegated ca channels whose currents drive exocytosis and the release of neurotransmitter at nerve terminals ca channels are composed of poreforming αsubunits along with auxiliary ß αδ and ɣ subunits by modulating ca channel activity synaptic transmission is thus directly regulated modulation of the mtype k currents plays a strong role in regulating the excitability of neurons the firing of action potentials and the tone of smooth muscle many different receptors act via g proteins to modulate the m current and ca currents we know that these gprotein pathways use intracellular second messengers and that the intracellular mechanisms they use are often distinct one goal of the lab is to elucidate the mechanisms of this receptorspecificity of action model accounting for receptorspecific phosphoinositide and ca signals in sympathetic neurons all receptors activate plcß which in turn hydrolyses pip to ip and diacylglycerol dag the released ca is regulated by the ipr binding protein irbit which sets a threshold for ip sufficient to open iprs stimulation of m muscarinic acetylcholine receptors left is ineffective in producing cytoplasmic casignals since the ip produced is too far away from iprs thus ip at the ipr is too low to overcome the irbit threshold bradykinin b and purinergic py receptors right produce robust cytoplasmic ca signals due to their spatial colocalization with iprs where ip is sufficiently high via neuronal ca sensor ncs bradykinin and purinergic but not muscarinic stimulation accelerates pi iiißkinase activity via dagkinase conversion to phosphatidic acid pa the produced dag increases pip kinase pipk activity in concert with rhofamily proteins and rhokinase rk pip kinase activity is also increased by bradykinin and purinergic stimulation but for clarity this is only shown for muscarinic acceleration of both pi iiiß and pip kinases is required to increase pip synthesis that compensates for consumption of pip by plc   we study these channels using preparations of primary sympathetic and sensory neurons cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells and using heterologous mammalian expression systems our major approaches include patch clamp electrophysiology along with techniques of molecular biology and biochemistry to probe the molecular mechanism of ion channel modulation we also perform singlecell living imaging experiments using confocal and tirf microscopy specialized lasers and highlysensitive cameras such techniques include ca imaging förster resonance energy transfer fret in vivo brain imaging and gfptagged reporter fluorescent probes to directly observe the creation reduction or translocation in individual cells of many putative second messengers   recently we have begun to study the clustering of signaling complexes by the scaffolding protein akinase anchoring protein akap9 akaps organize signalosomes that include kinases phosphatases calmodulin phosphoinositides receptors and ion channels using transgenic knockout mice patchclamp electrophysiology fret and gfp translocation experiments we have shown akap9 to orchestrate both shortterm modulation of mtype k and ltype ca channels in a receptorspecific manner as well as longerterm regulation of kcnq gene transcription via nfatc transcription factors acting as a negativefeedback loop that prevents hyperexcitabilty in the brain such as seen during epilepsy or chronic pain an example experiment is shown below with the combined use of biophysics molecular biology biochemistry and singlecell imaging this lab works toward the identification of the relevant signaling molecules in modulation of ion channels and the understanding of the precise mechanisms they use   lab team chase carver maryann hobbs isamar sanchez rafael veraza fabio vigil education ba physics
