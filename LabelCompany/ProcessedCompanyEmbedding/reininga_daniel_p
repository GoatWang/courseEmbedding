including some highlights from its history and an overview of its current operationsmr reininga lake shore savings bank was founded in  originally chartered as a savings and loan association lake shore has been serving our community for  years in april of  we completed a firststep initial public offering with approximately  of our stock being sold to the public and the remaining  of lake shore bancorp lsbk shares being retained by the mutual holding company the capital raised though our initial public offering was used to expand our business operations in erie county new york we have five branches in chautauqua county and now five branches in erie county with our last branch in erie county being opened in april of twst for the bank how has loan growth held up during the recession and which categories of loans have been more resilient than othersmr reininga year over year our loan growth basically has been stable our net loans increased  from yearend  to yearend  with the mix of the loan portfolio weighted a bit more toward commercial real estate loans yields obviously are a bit better in the commercial real estate lending marketplace we are not chasing yields by originating commercial real estate loans but we look at that product type as an opportunity to take advantage of conservative higheryielding loan originations my background as a real estate developer is one of the strengths that i bring to lake shore by fully understanding the risks and rewards associated with conservative commercial real estate lending opportunities our commercial real estate portfolio grew from  million yearend  to  million yearend  which is a  increase year over year in that portfolio so that has been a good growth opportunity for us conservative commercial real estate lending has helped to keep our yields on our loan portfolio higher and weve enjoyed thattwst which outstanding or recently enacted regulatory issues are most impactful for lake shore and how are you managing that impactmr reininga lake shore savings bank prior to july   was governed by the office of thrift supervision ots our midtier savings and loan holding company and our mutual holding company were governed by the ots as well so we had an examination approach geared to onestop shopping prior to july   now lake shore saving bank is regulated by the occ and the two holding companies are regulated by the federal reserve bank specifically the federal reserve bank of philadelphia the regulatory shift has created a little bit of uncertainty for usadditionally the regulatory environment in regards to the doddfrank act has created tremendous uncertainty for many banks including ours the regulatory statutes of the doddfrank act will eventually impose new capital levels that we will have to maintain the regulatory guidance has yet to establish what the new capital levels will be and the regulators have a winkwink approach to what the new capital levels may be but there is nothing formally published about the new levelswe do have a very aggressive approach to making sure that we are meeting the needs of our new regulators whether with respect to enterprise risk management or incorporating changes to our policies to accommodate the different approach to achieve expectations mandated from the regulatory component of our business weve been very aggressive at making sure that we implement policies to comply with known regulatory changes our last exam from the ots was in april of  so we expect an occ exam probably by the fourth quarter of  we are looking forward to our first occ exam with great anticipation the exam will be our report card on how well weve managed to address the initial transition from the ots to the occthe wall street transcript is a unique service for investors and
