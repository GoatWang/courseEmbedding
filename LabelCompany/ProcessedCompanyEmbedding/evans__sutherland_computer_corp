historical information contained herein this quarterly report on form q includes certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the

or plan set forth in forwardlooking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements which speak only as of the date made the company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise all dollar amounts are in thousands executive summary on april   the company executed the settlement agreement to terminate its pension plan and to settle the underlying pension liabilities this is a major milestone and completes a process that began over two years ago the companys goal in seeking a distress termination of the pension plan is to ensure that the pension benefits of all pension plan participants are paid up to federally guaranteed limits and that the company continues to operate as a going concern while avoiding the costly damage and disruption to the business which would result from bankruptcy reorganization we believe the settlement agreement has achieved that goal the first quarter of  reported improved sales volume and  of net income compared to the first quarter of  which reported a net loss of  the stronger sales and resulting net income in the first quarter of  was attributable to stronger sales bookings over the past year the sales backlog improved which creates an encouraging outlook for the remainder of  with the improved backlog and strong sales prospects we anticipate that sales and overall results for the remainder of  will exceed the results from  we continue to expect variable but reasonably consistent future sales and gross profits from our current product line at annual levels sufficient to cover or exceed operating expenses with the settlement of the pension plan liabilities we expect an improved financial position that may present opportunities for better results through the availability of credit and stronger qualification for customer projects critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our condensed consolidated financial statements their application requires significant management judgment with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of critical accounting policies can be found in our form k for the year ended december   for all of these policies management cautions that future results rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require modification table of contents results of operations sales and backlog the following table summarizes our sales for the three months ended april   march   sales     sales for the first three months of  were  higher than the same period in  the higher  sales were attributable to progress and deliveries on larger customer contracts as compared to the same period of  revenue backlog continued to improve totaling  as of april   compared to  as of december   we expect sales for the remainder of  to result in total annual sales in excess of  based on delivery schedules from the improved revenue backlog and strong sales prospects gross profit the following table summarizes our gross profit and the gross profit as a percentage of total sales for the three months ended april   march   gross profit     gross profit percentage     gross profit for the first quarter was favorably affected by higher sales volume which absorbed fixed overhead as well as sales from specific contracts with favorable margins operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the three months ended april   march   selling general and administrative     research and development   pension   total operating expenses     for the first quarter of  selling general and administrative expenses were higher than the comparable period of  due primarily to a higher use of labor resources for sales and marketing activities for the first quarter of  research and development expenses were higher than the comparable period of  this was attributable primarily to engineering resources being redirected from customer projects and selling expenses to research and development activities pension expense for the first quarter of  was higher than the same period of  because of actuarial estimates with the termination of the pension plan future pension expense will be reduced to the expenses attributable to the serp table of contents other expense net the following table summarizes our other expense for the three months ended april   march   total other expense net     for the three months ended april   other expense net was less than the same period in  due primarily to a decrease in interest expense interest expense was less than the prior period due to the extinguishment of the financing lease obligation as a result of the company not exercising an option to purchase the subject real estate and entering into a new operating lease for that property liquidity and capital resources outlook as discussed above in the executive summary and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements we have made significant progress in our effort to reverse our long history of operating losses and we believe that that the termination of the pension plan with the settlement of the underling pension liabilities achieved our goal of reducing our obligations to an amount which the business can sustain as a result we believe existing liquidity resources and funds generated from forecasted revenue will meet our current and longterm obligations upon adjustment for the settlement of the pension liabilities we continue to operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures cash flows in the first three months of   of cash used in operating activities was attributable to  of cash from the net income for the period after the effect of  of noncash items plus an unfavorable change to working capital of  the change to working capital was driven by increases in inventory and receivables attributable to the timing of billings and new customer orders in the first three months of   of cash provided by operating activities was attributable to  of cash absorbed by the net loss for the period after the effect of  of noncash items plus a favorable change to working capital of  the change to working capital was driven by progress payments from customer contracts attributable to the timing of billings and new customer orders cash used in investing activities was  in the first three months of  compared to cash provided by investing activities of  for the same period of  the company had purchases of property and equipment of  in  and no proceeds from sale of marketable securities the company had proceeds from marketable securities offset by purchases of property and equipment of  in  in the first three months of  financing activities used  of cash compared to  in  for principal payments on mortgage notes table of contents line of credit the company is a party to a line of credit agreement with a commercial bank which until october   permitted borrowings of up to  to fund spitz working capital requirements under the line of credit agreement interest is charged on amounts borrowed at the wall street journal prime rate any borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by spitz real and personal property and all of the outstanding shares of spitz common stock the line of credit agreement and mortgage notes contain cross default provisions whereby the default of either agreement will result in the default of both agreements on october   the commercial bank notified the company that it is no longer obligated to make advances under the line of credit agreement and elected to suspend future advances because of events of default on loan covenants resulting from the liens placed on the companys assets by the pension plan the company believes that with the settlement of the pension liabilities it will be able to comply with covenants as required by the commercial bank and that later in  the bank will permit new borrowings for potential working capital requirements there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit agreement during  and  and as of april   there was no
