fourth quarter and fullyear  earnings call were very pleased with our results for the year gaap revenue grew  yearoveryear gaap net loss was  million and gaap cash from operations was  million reflecting  yearoveryear growth fullyear adjusted revenue grew  yearoveryear to  million fullyear adjusted ebitda grew  yearoveryear to  million unlevered free cash flow as reported grew  yearoveryear and free cash flow grew  yearoveryear we believe that free cash flow growth will provide us continued opportunity and flexibility and were pleased to see continued strong growth in this metric in addition our total subscriber base increased during the year from  million to  million at an arps of  on slide  in addition to finishing a year of healthy growth we also made progress on our previously announced acquisition of constant contact last week on february  we completed the transaction paying constant contact shareholders  per share the total transaction value was  billion net of cash on the constant contact balance sheet the purchase price was approximately  million we remain very excited about the combination of our subscriber acquisition funnel product capabilities talented pool of employees and the opportunity to provide smbs with a full suite of tools for online marketing services our integration timeline is progressing as planned shortly after close of the transaction we implemented our first phase of integration we notified employees of head count reductions and also began consolidating field office functions initial plans include the winding down of the san francisco united kingdom and florida footprints and delivering these functions through the waltham headquarters office we continue to anticipate reaching our originally targeted annual run rate cost synergies of  million starting at the end of  with potential upside in revenue and marketing synergies both teams have worked diligently to meet our timelines and were all focused on building the best teams to move forward i would like to welcome the members of the constant contact family and its leadership team gail goodman will be moving on to other ventures while harp grewal former cfo of constant contact will lead the brands operations joe hughes will continue to head up the emerging ventures group and ken surdan will continue to lead the product and development group both will work closely with the endurance team on product development and innovation over the last few months we also completed the financing related to the transaction on february  we closed on an incremental term loan in the amount of  million and  million in unsecured notes and replaced our existing  million revolving credit facility with a new  million revolving credit facility we believe that well be able to delever quickly if we achieve our targeted growth and adjusted ebitda and free cash flow generation importantly as part of this acquisition we believe we have the opportunity to reduce cost and better balance top line and investment in order to drive accretive ebitda and future cash flows our plan for the reduction in cost was based primarily on head count reductions which accounts for  million of the  million in targeted annual run rate synergies with the head count reductions last week we eliminated approximately  million in annual run rate costs we intend to continue to balance costs and investments appropriately across our brands in order to continue to leverage our scale the combination of endurance and constant contact positions us firmly as a leader in the smb online marketing products and services space were excited to add enhanced product and technology capabilities to our existing foundation as we have expanded beyond web presence to a full suite of smb products and services importantly we believe that the transaction will benefit us operationally and financially as our scale continues to build we will be able to leverage our position in technology marketing channels and product to support longerterm growth and value creation in fiscal year  we expect approximately  billion in revenue and approximately  million in adjusted ebitda endurance exited the year with momentum in recent initiatives our site builder product which launched in the second half of  is showing much promise were excited with the traction todate and regard this as an example of the results we can achieve through a combined effort innovating at a fast pace in order to deliver a product that smbs value in q we launched our mobile site builder product impressly which allows smbs to easily aggregate components of their web presence we continue to roll out adjacent products and services that can be secured through one central marketing funnel in the same vein we recently rolled out a resume builder tool which has aimed at helping smbs network and find potential candidates in addition to the recent constant contact close in q we acquired the assets of ix web hosting for a total consideration of  million ix provides core web hosting services targeted at smbs subsequent to quarter end we increased our equity ownership on our site builder joint venture wz uk ltd starting in q  results of this business will be consolidated with our financial results which weve been working toward since our initial investment in the joint venture in q of fiscal  internationally we continue to make progress as well gaap revenue from subscribers from international geographies totaled  of our revenue an increase from  of gaap revenue in the last fiscal year the vast majority of our transactions take place in us dollars which has minimized currency impact to the top line we continue to see benefit from our investment in brazil with higherthanaverage revenue growth rates we plan to launch our mobile site builder product in the brazilian market during h turning to our partnership pipeline we launched a partnership with kabbage a company that fulfills working capital needs for smbs we continue to view partnerships as a way to test interest in certain products and garner key insights into our subscriber base as we noted last august we reorganized primary lines of responsibility between our flagship businesses from our newer gateway businesses which are at higher growth rates these include our site builder cloud gateways mobile site builder and other solutions ron lasalvia will continue to head up the organizations flagship business and will fold responsibility for the constant contact brand ron has done an amazing job heading up these efforts as chief operating officer i am pleased to announce that he will serve in the role of president in addition to chief operating officer formalizing the role he has played organizationally on slide  were excited at all that we have accomplished during the past fiscal year we believe that our efforts and investments will reap benefits in years to come over the years our business has expanded and weve done so by setting a strategy and investing ahead of the curve this year is no different we plan to invest significantly more in program marketing while balancing top and bottom line growth appropriately we believe our focus will drive new subscribers to platform where we can provide solutions to help them grow their businesses were excited about  and feel confident in our ability to reach our targets with that ill turn the call over to marc montagner our chief financial officer marc montagner  chief financial officer thank you hari on slide  we could see that we are very happy with our fullyear result for the full year ending december   adjusted revenue grew  yearoveryear to  million within our guidance of  million to  million adjusted ebitda grew at  yearoveryear to  million within our guidance of  million to  million capital expenditure were less than  of adjusted revenue and free cash flow defined as cash flow from operation less capex and capitalized lease grew  yearoveryear to  million resulting in free cash flow per share of  for the year slide  in the fourth quarter of  adjusted revenue was  million reflecting yearoveryear growth of  adjusted ebitda was  million reflecting yearoveryear growth of  and free cash flow was  million resulting in free cash flow per share of  free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by transaction expenses integration charges restructuring expenses and legalrelated expenses of approximately  million on slide  you could see the total subscriber on the platform increased during  by over  to approximately  million subs average revenue per subscriber for the full year was  versus  for the same period a year ago our forecast is on increasing our total subscriber count in a profitable way arps is being pressured by subscriber coming to our platform through lowerpriced product and new subscribers being loaded at low introductory prices in the first year in  just like in  we will focus on increasing our subscriber numbers slide  last quarter we noted that we had identified errors while migrating data from our legacy business intelligence system to an upgraded bi system these errors impacted certain operating metrics we are reporting our corrected metrics going back to the fourth quarter  which is the time at which the company went public at the top of the slide you could see the evolution of product per subs or pps since the fourth quarter of  we define pps as the number of product purchased across our platform divided by a subscriber at the end of the period whether bundled or individually in the revised pps the updated numbers have been corrected to adjust for coding errors that we discovered last quarter we also only counted subscriber who meet our definition of total subscriber for our major brands shown on the slide and we made the methodology consistent across multiple brands you will note that there was a significant increase in pps in the fourth quarter of  due to an adjustment that eliminated inactive customers from our subscriber count which were first identified as such in that same quarter the middle chart shows you the correct number of subscribers spending over  per year with us as you can see here the actual numbers were lower than originally disclosed as a result of coding errors but still reflect a positive trend the third chart reflect our monthly recurring revenue or mrr numbers which remain unchanged at  after a full recalculation of these metrics as we stated in the past our correction of pps and subscribers spending more than  per year with us did not impact our gaap financial result adjusted revenue adjusted ebitda free cash flow or unlevered free cash flow metrics this does not impact arps subscriber count churn or unit economics given the material contribution of constant contact to our business and the difference in subscriber profile we will no longer report pps or the number of subscribers spending over  were currently reviewing the metrics that we would provide to investors in the future in addition for the next four quarters we plan to break out constant contact revenues in our disclosure lets turn to guidance for  on slide  we have previously provided guidance on a quarterly and annual basis starting this fiscal year we are moving to annual guidance for adjusted revenue adjusted ebitda capital expenditure and free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash flow from operation minus capex and capitalized leases we will no longer provide guidance for unlevered free cash flow as reported given the timing of the close of the acquisition of constant contact on february   our  result will not include a full contribution from constant contact our guidance for  therefore includes pro forma fullyear numbers as well as number based on the date of close this guidance does not assume any incremental ma for  we expect annual adjusted revenue expectation for fullyear pro forma of the constant contact acquisition of more than  million expected adjusted revenue based on the date of close of greater than  million expected adjusted ebitda on a pro forma basis of approximately  million expected adjusted ebitda based on the date of close of approximately  million and capex of approximately  million for the year this year we expect significant transaction expenses related to financing option acceleration and restructuring charges associated with the constant contact deal which would impact free cash flow excluding these expenses we expect free cash flow defined as cash flow from operation less capex of  million to  million including the impact of these expenses which we expect to be approximately  million we expect free cash flow of  million to  million on a combined pro forma basis we continue to expect  million in pro forma annual run rate synergies in  as noted earlier we eliminated approximately  million in annual run rate costs last week with the head count reduction i would also like to highlight some items underlying these assumptions revenue expectation remain as previously stated as we streamline operation at constant contact our objective is to maximize free cash flow and focus on profitable growth we expect to grow constant contact at low to midsingle digit while we optimize operation and marketing spend the balance of the gross will come from endurance product as hari noted we expect to increase investment in marketing significantly in  based on the testing done last year and the corresponding marketing yield we see opportunity to invest behind the endurance brand in fiscal  on slide  you could see that we financed the constant contact transaction through an incremental  billion in new debt  million in incremental sevenyear term loan at a rate of l and  million in unsecured note at a coupon of  with an eightyear maturity we also raised a new fiveyear revolving credit facility in aggregate amount of  million which is undrawn at this stage and replace the old revolver of  million the spread on our existing term loan has increased to l and will likely further increase to l on february  we expect to pay approximately  million in cash interest in  with this transaction were able to improve our financial flexibility adding approximately  million of cash to our balance sheet and providing additional liquidity with the undrawn revolver in place while also extending out maturities our next scheduled maturity is november  on the existing term loan based on our pro forma view of last  months adjusted ebitda at december   this translate into leverage of  turns on a secured basis and  turns on unsecured basis objective is to reduce total debt to adjusted ebitda to below  turns by the end of  slide  in conclusion we are very happy to see that our business achieved strong yearoveryear growth in  we feel very confident about  now id like to turn the call back to chanel to begin qa thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from jason helfstein of oppenheimer your line is now open please go ahead and our next question comes from gregg moskowitz of cowen  co your line is now open please go ahead unknown speaker yes hi this is actually mike  going in for gregg this morning i was just wondering how many subscribers did constant contact have as of december  hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure hey how is it going so with constant contact based on how they define their subscribers so its over  subscribers as we get that forwarded to our platform and look to see what fits our definition et cetera we anticipate that being north of half a million but when we report on a consolidated basis this quarter well have some insights into that unknown speaker okay great and just one more i know a few months ago in limited testing you guys were driving about  of constant contacts net ads by virtue of your partnership with them can you say how thats been tracking since then hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director its been doing quite well off the size of the current funnel its anywhere between  and  of the signups that are coming through us and now that the deal is closed the teams are working very closely together to be able to increase that and drive further volume into the constant contact funnel off our existing funnel and off our existing base of customers as well unknown speaker okay great thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from brian essex of morgan stanley your line is now open please go ahead brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc good morning and thank you for taking the question marc a question for you i guess with the combination of constant contact given the profile that you just kind of highlighted with the reduction in debt target by the end of fiscal  with the addition of constant contact to the platform as well how might your ma appetite change versus how endurance has run its acquisition strategy historically what will you be focusing on and will you be perhaps taking a pause from ma or managing it a little bit differently maybe a little bit of color there would help hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure this is hari so from an ma standpoint obviously weve just completed this sizeable transaction its a big team we have a lot of work still in front of us cut out for getting the integration done realizing the synergies and the costs on the revenue side our bar for ma is probably significantly higher than it ever has been in the past weve always been very judicious about capital deployment and looking at return on invested capital irrs and present value of acquisitions as we have done them in the past but given the fact that there is significant opportunity within our current asset base and given the opportunities for further refining those i would say over the next four to six quarters from an ma standpoint the bar is quite a bit higher with the focus more on debt pay down for the business to get the leverage down as marc noted in his remarks brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc got it and maybe just to clarify what will we have going forward for constant contact with regard to metrics that will help us finetune our models will we have subscribers and arpu and maybe costs associated with them or how do you plan to manage those metrics going forward hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director obviously sort of as integration goes forward its always difficult on the cost side to be able to break things out because we run it as one business but we – similar to directi which was the last kind of meaningful acquisition weve done where weve broken out the revenue by quarter for directi we would certainly be doing that for constant contact for the next four quarters and again from the synergies and the synergy realization we plan on talking to folks about that every quarter and giving people an update as we go along beyond that were still assessing metrics and trying to figure out what really represents the combined company and the profile of the combined company because it has changed fairly dramatically from the last few years and hope to come back with a view on what it is that wed be providing to folks in the first quarter earnings call brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from jason helfstein of oppenheimer your line is now open please go ahead jason helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you had mute technical issues there so to start i think the free cash flow was a bit – the guidance for this year is a bit better than we were looking for and i want to say thank you for focusing on kind of a clean free cash flow also i think constant contact guidance is pretty much in line with synergies however it does look like the core endurance margin is going to be a bit lower than we were looking for and i think in your prepared remarks you talked about more aggressive marketing what are you seeing that makes you effectively – thats a change i guess from kind of i guess – i dont know – let us know if you think that that would change versus when you last talked about the business preconstant contact and if theres a way to help us understand why youre confident that that is marketing well spent second question any update on the sec inquiry if nothing thats fine just want to ask that and then lastly is there a way to talk about the impact of promotional pricing if you have any data on what youre seeing like on second year arps renewals and the kind of the pricing trends there thanks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure happy to jason i think from our standpoint we had talked over the course of last year especially in the second half of the year with the launch of a lot of additional new product gateways testing on marketing we had been ramping into this year we feel quite good about the yields were getting on a lot of these marketing spends and as we noted in the prepared remarks we will be spending significantly more in program marketing this year as compared to last year even without the constant contact as a marketing spend addition weve been looking at the subscriber acquisition costs against the customer lifetime value those have all been looking good so we feel very comfortable increasing the spend because we believe that it helps both top line and bottom line growth this year and compounds even more so going into next year and the years after so it is dollars well spent obviously as we noted the increase in revenue yearoveryear is not inclusive of any ma so all of the growth in the business is coming without any new incremental ma a part of that being reflected by the fact that we are accelerating marketing spend and we feel good about that taking your third question also at this point in terms of renewal dollars were certainly seeing the same trend that weve talked about in the past which is after the first year of intro pricing as people come up for renewal the revenue per user does go up for those folks because theyre as baked in pricing that they renew at higher pricing on the back end and that trend has been very consistent and obviously on the sec inquiry matter we are working with the sec giving them what it is that they need and thats really all we have in terms of an update at this point in time jason helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from brian fitzgerald of jefferies your line is now open please go ahead brian p fitzgerald  jefferies llc thanks guys we wanted to ask around the macro environment have you seen any impacts there any meaningful change to churn with your current subs any reluctance to purchase upgrades or additional products has the sales cycle lengthened at all and then second question we think the kabbage relationship is very interesting is that exclusive or are there other smb finance relationships you can add there thanks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure so in terms of the macro climate obviously were feeling very bullish about the business based on the guidance we provided again that didnt include any ma in the futurelooking guide for this year so things are robust as we sit here today certainly in terms of the growth itself as marc noticed we are still indexing almost all if not more than the rates weve provided towards subscriber additions we are still not particularly focused on the average revenue per sub thats more an output for our business as long as customers come in theyre high quality and the churn rates are in line and they buy additional products and services from us and over time arps will become something that has a more normalized pattern so we will continue to index towards net subscriber growth indicative of the fact that there really hasnt been much macro impact to the business todate in terms of the kabbage relationship weve had that now for about two months actually very positive feedback from our customers lots of folks originating working capital lines through the kabbage partnership and capital obviously is a big pain point for small and mediumsized businesses and access to capital so as weve looked at that we are certainly now considering other potential financial products that could be relevant to smbs we think thats an interesting area that provides some good value for our customer base brian p fitzgerald  jefferies llc great thanks hari operator thank you and our next question comes from mitch bartlett of craighallum your line is now open please go ahead mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc thank you good morning interested in kind of growth assumptions constant contacts endurance you talked about low to midsingle digits for constant contact and im just wondering given the advantage that you have with the ability to crosssell and new distribution channels aimed at constant contact why so slow a growth and then i know this is the bane of your existence trying to parse out organic growth on the endurance side against all the acquisitions but if i put  growth on constant contact i get endurance growth of around  or numbers what would be the organic number there hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure on the first question in terms of why we are talking about low to midsingledigit growth for constant contact its primarily because its a big acquisition we are in the middle of reorganizing the entire company and getting the teams lined up ron has been working hard with harp to try to get the teams coordinated as folks may recall the year after we did the hostgator acquisition its pretty normal for us to try to take back marketing spend somewhat until the integration is fully done were still testing a lot of product gateways that could line up well for constant contact customers so what we dont like to do is overspend in that window of time both from a marketing standpoint until we know where the best yields are so were very disciplined about how we think about spending in shorter windows trying to optimize for longer periods of time certainly we see upside in being able to crosssell products and services those are not necessarily baked into our guidance at this point and we just want to take some time to make sure the teams are lined up the costs are in line and as we did with hostgator after that acquisition was done we were able to accelerate marketing the year after and thats not very dissimilar to our typical playbook as we go through a large acquisition so that is reflective and i think your backing in math for endurance of about  that does sound right mitch i think thats exactly where it shakes out and as we noticed the only sort of inorganic element in that  growth would be the fullyear contribution of the smaller ma items we did last year it does not include any new ma in that number weve done a few of the smaller tuckunder hosting asset acquisitions last year over the course of the year which included arvixe and site and verio and ix so we would have the fullyear contribution of that this year but besides that everything else would be just growth from the business mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc just as a followon on the growth question for constant contact after you take this step back though long term it seemed like you could materially affect the economics of that business on customer acquisition and return on that do you still believe that and could you give us a venture they use to spend over  to get a customer what might it be in the future hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure i think it would be speculative at this point but from our standpoint we do see that once were able to get the acquisition model to be much more webacquisition focused where about  of the sales for constant contact now comes with hand holding for the customer with phone calls to convert people from trial to payups the more we convert that to more of a webacquisition model this sac start to come down obviously because its more self service and the cost to operate that is lower there is good opportunity to be able to upsell additional products and services into the base of constant contact customers and again constant contact products into the base of endurance customers were starting to experiment with a freetopaid model a freemium type of a model with alternative brands so a lot in the works and we do think that if some of these hit there is some really good potential upside there in this business mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc sounds great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steven ju of credit suisse your line is now open please go ahead steve d ju  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks so hari im trying to get a sense of how much downward pressure there will be on your total report at arps as you bring on lower price point new subscribers are you able to say where the typical entry level of new subscriber is coming in and what that was a yearago and as you look to acquire more subscribers should we be anticipating continuous sort of downward pressure there on the entry price and i guess sort of directionally following up on the earlier question versus the smbs who were already on endurance how do the size or the type of businesses compare at constant contact and at this point are you able to tell how receptive this newly acquired cohort will be for your more highvalue add products thanks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure steven so on the first question obviously as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we added  – our base of subscribers increased by about  in  the arps went down to about  or so from ish range the prior year introductory pricing still has been fairly consistent yearoveryear but as volume of customers go up certainly that puts pressure on the average revenue per subscriber side there are new gateways were investing behind so we feel that there are some gateways that actually are at much higher introductory pricing than our existing brands but we do believe in the indexing towards subscriber strategy because we do consistently see that over time subscribers that stay with us pay more and engage with the higherpriced products and services so that strategy still makes sense to us and that is something we look at fairly carefully as well in terms of constant contact and what the profile of the customer there is still a majority of the customers there are sub employees very similar to the endurance base of customers they probably skew slightly bigger if the endurance average number of employees is four to five employees they may be closer to six to seven employees theres a slightly higher indexing towards nonprofits in the constant contact base as well but we do believe that across the spectrum both having a lightweight version of the constant contact product within the existing endurance space at prices that make sense for our kind of customers and incremental products that we have within the product portfolio of endurance being offered to the constant contact customer base has some good potential upside none of which weve actually baked into our forecast currently in our guidance steve d ju  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of deepak mathivanan of deutsche bank your line is now open please go ahead deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc thanks two questions guys so first after the close of constant contact acquisition youre likely generating close to  million in unlevered free cash flow over the next few years so is the priority to reduce leverage and what do you see is the comfortable level where you want to hold leverage and then i have another followup related to the core business hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure i think deepak from an unlevered free cash flow that number would be probably slightly higher as we kind of work our way into it i think from our standpoint given that leverage now is around  turns as marc mentioned our hope is to get that to  turns or lower by end of  so uses of free cash flow primarily towards debt pay down we would obviously look at opportunistic ma and if theres a deal thats too good to pass on we will consider that but the bar will be much higher so between the combination of growth and ebitda and opportunistic pay down of debt we believe that we can bring that leverage level to below  turns by end of next year and thats the current perspective from the company deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc got it thats helpful and then from a product standpoint last quarter you mentioned that certain launches were delayed into fourth quarter and then you expect to realize benefits of that in fiscal year  i think products such as wordpress manager  wordpress hosting so can you discuss on the progress there and how it tracked during fourth quarter and what was assumed into the fiscal year  guidance hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure so theres a multiple things that we have been working on weve launched a series of products around resume and resume management for customers the cloud product launch that did quite well q turned it up quite nicely as compared to q and that trend continues on to this year and i think as we had kind of anticipated once the products were out the door the compounding would start happening and that the take rates would be good thats exactly what were seeing and if you notice the earlier question from gregg sic mitch  was around what the assumptions are in the business if you assume  or so as he did for constant contact growth which is  growth for the endurance core hardly very much of that coming from a fullyear contribution of ma most of that just coming from the core business so we feel good about the products that came out the door and that there are several more that are underway and to be launched soon deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc got it if i can ask one more so the net subs adds was strong even after excluding kind of the asset consolidation that you did was there anything specific that you call out i mean q is usually the seasonally slow quarter but the adds were somewhat in line with what weve seen in the first quarter and much better than the third quarter so is kind of like the current run rate the right way to think about the quarterly net adds that you would be targeting for the quarter hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director i think it may be even a little north of that deepak because if you looked at the guides we provided we say kind of arps is flat to slightly down yearoveryear for fiscal  which means that all of the growth is coming from the net subscriber addition so our anticipation is that it will be north of last years net subscriber addition for the full year this year and we also mentioned that were meaningfully increasing marketing spend going into this year which obviously translates to significant subscriber addition growth deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc got it thats helpful thanks hari hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director thanks deepak operator thank you very much and our next question comes from the line of gray powell from wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead priya parasuraman  wells fargo securities llc thank you this is actually priya parasuraman for gray so can you talk about the competitive environment that youre seeing and do you think you will still be active in the ma market in  and what kind of valuations are you seeing in the private market hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sorry priya can you repeat the first part of that question that was – it got a little choppy priya parasuraman  wells fargo securities llc just the competitive environment any changes especially with some of the ma activities that other players in the market have undertaken recently hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure sort of from the competitive landscape standpoint as we enter additional markets – so for example now that wz uk has been consolidated into our platform were very active in the web builder space there are obviously different players there than in the hosting space in other tangential spaces that we look at like security solutions or resume building there are other players there so we certainly sort of – from that perspective the landscape has broadened both in terms of the kind of products and customers that were onboarding and the competitive players in those segments are different than hosting some of them a little more competitive some of them a little less competitive depending on what the gateway product is certainly in terms of the ma element we are setting a very high bar for ma over the next four to six quarters we would need to be convinced that something is say better use of our time and capital versus focusing on the substance of business we have and the subsequent amount of work we have to get done to get the integration completed and realizing synergies certainly from a private market transaction standpoint the ones we have done todate with that same framework as weve always talked about which is  to  times ebitda and net of synergies maybe its mid to highsingle digits depending on the particular transaction we are not seeing that changing its more a focus for ourself to work on the significant task ahead of us and also delevering the company which is what we told the markets which is as long as there is an opportunistic ma acquisition we are fine levering up but as we did between  and  since we went public we would then work on delevering the business back to sub turns priya parasuraman  wells fargo securities llc thank you operator thank you and im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over to hari for closing remarks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director

ceo hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director thanks angela good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter  earnings call before providing commentary in q id like to discuss the constant contact transactions that we announced this morning concurrent with earnings release were very excited about the transaction the company its offerings and how it fits with endurance strategically this acquisition combines two companies focused on helping smbs grow and succeed via online services and products we share much in common such as our technology capabilities and our enthusiasm for small business to success but we also see an opportunity to bring together our different competencies as some of you know constant contact is a leading online marketing platform targeted at helping smbs and nonprofits grow their enterprises through a suite of products such as email marketing campaigns event management and contact management we at endurance have historically focused on other smb online services primarily through our web presence solutions typically once smbs are set up and running key on their list of priorities is growing their business in order to address these needs over the years weve expanded our offerings and provided tools such as security backup and ecommerce solutions but have done so primarily by means of partner offers through our distribution platform with this transaction we see continued opportunity to expand our position as a provider of complete endtoend web presence and marketing solutions for smbs endurances  million subscribers on platform will now have access to a full suite of constant contact products and other services outside of endurance space constant contact will have access to our healthy subscriber acquisition funnel and capabilities in marketing to smbs thereby enhancing their subscriber acquisition economics we also believe that endurances experience promoting multiple brands targeted at specific smb segments positions us well to potentially provide further adaptations of constant contact products through alternative brands while continuing to offer the higher engagement products constant contact currently offers the transaction also benefits us through scale both operationally and financially we expect that this will come from leveraging the fixed costs the sharing of talent and technology and product and the reduction of redundant costs which marc will discuss in his section additionally as our scale continues to build we believe well be able to leverage our position in technology marketing channels and product to support longerterm growth and value creation for our subscribers the transaction is expected to bring endurance to over  billion of estimated combined pro forma  adjusted revenue and approximately  million of estimated pro forma  adjusted ebitda on a combined pro forma basis for fiscal  we expect our adjusted revenue to grow at lowdouble digits yearoveryear and adjusted ebitda to reach approximately  million this positions us ahead of our original pace in our journey to reaching our longerterm adjusted ebitda and free cash flow goals in addition to scale were excited that the constant contact team will be joining us and bringing complementary focus and capabilities in areas that we see as an extension of endurances competencies weve historically focused more on our marketing network and distribution platform and to a lesser degree on product development constant contact is focused more on product and specifically on user experience robust subscriber analytics and engagement models their extraordinary understanding of the smb market is a result of focus in investment and understanding the needs and addressing the problems in smb space as they build their businesses we believe that the addition of these capabilities to our strong foundation will enhance our standing as a leader in online smb services as we have expanded beyond web presence to a full suite of products and services that are essential for smbs in their journey to success while we believe the transaction will create many opportunities for future benefit weve already seen many positives coming from our existing partnership with constant contact weve known each other for many years and have partnered on different programs were excited by the crosssell opportunities associated with adding constant contacts products and feel very comfortable that there is a considerable appetite within our subscriber base for their suite of products as a result of a program we launched earlier this year were now driving approximately  of constant contacts new unique customer additions further after initial analysis were excited about the strong recurring revenue and high retention rates of the subscribers using the constant contact product to slide  turning for a moment to our historic acquisitions and our track record endurance has completed over  acquisitions of varying sizes and strategic purposes since we started the business and we believe that ma is one of our core competencies constant contact will continue to operate at its own distinct brand and join other brands in the endurance portfolio that serve the large fragmented smb online services market we believe that our approach to operating a portfolio of brands under one umbrella facilitates a united framework for management of operations creating scale efficiencies in the organization regardless of whether an acquisition skews more towards a growth profile or a cash flow profile we have been able to achieve improved efficiencies as we integrate their operations into the existing endurance technology and distribution platform now to details of the transaction we signed the definitive agreement for the purchase of outstanding constant contact shares of  per share in an allcash transaction with approximately  million shares outstanding the total transaction is valued at  billion the valuation translates into approximately  times estimated  adjusted ebitda including cash on their balance sheet at closing and before factoring in synergies assuming annualized run rate synergies in addition the multiple is closer to seven times estimated  adjusted ebitda in  we expect the combined pro forma adjusted revenue of approximately  billion and combined pro forma adjusted ebitda of approximately  million we expect cost savings of approximately  million by the end of year one on a run rate basis for  on a combined pro forma basis we expect  to  yearoveryear growth in adjusted revenue and adjusted ebitda of approximately  million this transaction is expected to generate doubledigit accretion to free cash flow financing for the transaction has been fully committed we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of  contingent upon approval from constant contact shareholders antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions the transaction is also subject to a goshop period that ends on november   when we think about the smb online services space and endurances place in the landscape we believe that our lowcost subscriber onboarding funnel sets us apart leveraging our strong word of mouth and partner network to drive subscribers onto multiple brands supporting multiple product segments once on our platform we drive value with these subscribers via multiple touch points to provide them a more comprehensive web presence solution over the years every aspect of this strategy has expanded as you can see in slide  as these smbs grow their business they look for tools and services that help them meet their goals constant contact has been a leading online marketing platform that focuses on helping smbs and nonprofits grow with a suite of products and services aimed at helping their customers reach their growth and marketing goals the company was founded in  went public in  and has continued to be a category leader in smb online marketing services we believe that constant contacts core product still has less than  penetration in our target smb market and still has significant room to grow in addition to email marketing the company has added other tools to its suite including surveys event management contact management and reporting again were very excited to bring their talent and capabilities to our portfolio of brands and excited at the prospect of offering our subscribers a more comprehensive suite of solutions that addresses the wide range of their online marketing needs our focus on web presence space has allowed us to grow the business and realize the scale benefits that come with a growing base of millions of subscribers and addressing their expanding needs the acquisition of constant contact allows us to build on this model providing both our subscribers and theirs with access to a full suite of products and services and creating future opportunities for crosssell over the lifetime of a subscriber we believe that with the addition of these important tools for smbs we have a long runway to provide additional value slide  turning now to the endurance business we delivered a solid quarter with results that were within our range of expectations which marc will review in more detail in his section in addition to the constant contact acquisition we continue to focus on core business initiatives and expanding the gateways to our platform through products and services other than traditional hosting we see positive indicators in our sitebuilder joint venture and other products such as security solutions internationally we continue to increase efforts and have invested in building out our teams to support brazil on our recent mexico site launch third quarter gaap revenue in the international business was  similar to q of last fiscal year our current marketing partnership with constant contact continued to perform well also on the ma front during the quarter we acquired a data center in provo utah which we believe will allow us to better align our technology operations and data center support over time as we complete the integration of the data center we expect to see approximately  million of annualized savings we feel confident that the investments weve been making in these core business initiatives will drive growth in fiscal  we had expected some of these initiatives would bear results in the fiscal year however full launch of some products such as cloud hosting and optimized wordpress have been delayed into the later part of the fiscal year and corresponding compounding of revenue will be pushed into  during q we took further steps to form a more agile organization which we believe will drive better decisionmaking and costefficiencies as the business evolves as a result of these changes we had higherthanusual restructuring expenses in q we feel very confident on our position to drive healthy growth in both revenue and adjusted ebitda in fiscal  on a standalone basis despite all the moving pieces during the quarter were very pleased of the results and the continued work of our teams in order to support our place as a leader in smb online services space were excited about accelerating our journey to reaching our longerterm goals and driving longterm shareholder value now id like to turn the call over to marc montagner our cfo marc montagner  chief financial officer thank you hari on slide  first of all i am very pleased to report that in the third quarter both adjusted revenue and adjusted ebitda grew  yearoveryear and came within our range of expectation adjusted revenue was  million reflecting yearoveryear growth of  adjusted ebitda was  million also reflecting yearoveryear growth of  unlevered free cash flow as reported was  million and free cash flow was  million free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by integration restructuring transaction and legalrelated expenses of approximately  million foreign currency fluctuation have also impacted our results over the last quarter excluding impact of yearoveryear currency exchange rates adjusted revenue and adjusted ebitda would have been higher by approximately  million and  million respectively slide  looking at the result on a yeartodate basis for the nine months ending september   adjusted revenue grew  yearoveryear to  million adjusted ebitda grew  yearoveryear to  million unlevered free cash flow as reported grew  yearoveryear to  million and free cash flow grew  yearoveryear to  million slide  now turning to operating metrics we increased net subscriber by over  in the third quarter bringing total subscribers on our platform to approximately  million subs average revenue per subscriber arps was  on a yeartoyear basis – yeartodate basis arps was  versus  for the same period a yearago slide  turning to other metrics i would like to mention that we are not showing three performance metric this quarter monthly recurring revenue or mrr number of product per subs pps and the number of subscribers paying us over  per year we recently identified an error while migrating some data from our legacy business intelligence system to an upgraded bi system which impacted these metrics were on the process of recalculating these numbers this system is completely separate from the erp system that produces our financial and subscriber data we believe that our previously reported mrr numbers will remain at  for at least the last four quarters revised numbers for both the number of product per subs and number of plus subs are expected to be lower than the previously reported numbers this does not impact our gaap financial result adjusted revenue adjusted ebitda free cash flow or unlevered free cash flow metrics this also does not impact arps subscriber count churn unit economics we will provide update in metric information as soon as it is available the purpose of the pps and the plus metrics was to provide additional insights to element that can directly impact arps here on this slide we show you on a more granular level our customer spending on our platform evolves over time we are providing two views on the top one for current active subscribers and one for subscriber over time on the bottom the chart on the bottom factors in the impact of churn typically a new sub will come to our platform at a lower introductory price for the first term which is typically  months coming out of introductory pricing and crossselling of additional products drive monthly spend higher over time driving subscriber unit growth puts downward pressure on average monthly spend because of the lower introductory pricing in the first year however we drive significant value from new subs as they increase their spending with us over time as a result we tend to index more towards subscriber growth which provide opportunities to generate additional revenues and free cash flow over the long term slide  now that we have reviewed the third quarter results lets turn to guidance for the remainder of the year starting with adjusted revenue with one quarter left in the fiscal year were narrowing our  guidance range and expect adjusted revenue in the range of  million to  million or  yearoveryear growth at the midpoint of the range adjusted ebitda expectations for the full year are now  million to  million reflecting  yearoveryear growth at the midpoint of the range full year  expectation for unlevered free cash flow as reported remain unchanged at approximately  million to  million reflecting  yearoveryear growth at the midpoint free cash flow is now expected to be approximately  million reflecting growth of  yearoveryear slide  sic   turning to fiscal  guidance we expect that our fiscal  investment as well as our disciplined view on capital deployment whether we are reinvesting in the business or through ma will continue to build value for our shareholders for  we want to focus on free cash flow generation and disciplined topline growth first on a standalone basis our expectation for fiscal year  are as follows adjusted annual revenue yearoveryear growth of approximately  to  annual adjusted ebitda yearoveryear growth of approximately  to  capex of approximately  of adjusted revenue and a free cash flow yearoveryear growth of approximately  to  when taking into consideration the impact of the acquisition of constant contact our guidance for fiscal  on a combined pro forma basis is the following adjusted annual revenue yearoveryear growth of approximately  to  adjusted ebitda of approximately  million for the full year including realized synergies and capex of approximately  of combined adjusted revenues on a combined basis pro forma run rate synergies of approximately  million will result in adjusted ebitda margins of  or more also including cost to achieve synergies the transaction is expected to drive doubledigit accretion to free cash flows in fiscal  we feel extremely confident about delivering at least  million of cost synergies on an annual run rate basis these synergies have been built on a bottomup approach and we believe that they were very achievable our plan is to realize at least  million of cost synergies in fiscal  additional revenue synergies or crossselling opportunities are not factored into these synergy numbers slide  we plan to finance the constant contact transactions to an incremental  billion in debt  million in an incremental term loan and  million in highyield debt at a fixed rate credit suisse and goldman sachs are providing debt financing on a fully committed basis additionally as part of this transaction we anticipate expanding the maturity of our existing term loan next year fiscal  we expect combined pro forma adjusted ebitda of approximately  million for the full year including realized synergies of  million these translate into leverage of  turns on a secured basis and  turns on an unsecured basis we plan on exiting  with a run rate of synergies of  million and having pro forma adjusted ebitda of approximately  million for the full year  this will take our leverage down by almost half a turn by the end of  slide  in conclusion we are very pleased to see that are our business achieved a  yearoveryear growth rate in the last quarter and we feel very confident about fiscal  finally we expect our business to drive significant adjusted ebitda and free cash flow growth for the next few years we feel very confident that the existing opportunities in our core business combined with ma will accelerate delivery of our longterm financial goal now id like to turn the call back to the operator to begin qa questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of brian essex with morgan stanley your line is now open brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc good morning and thank you for taking the question i was wondering if you could maybe address a little bit more color around how we might expect arpu to trend over the next couple of quarters and maybe whats embedded in your guidance i understand you have some introductory pricing that may be skewing it a little bit so just want to get a better understanding how long you might expect that to persist and maybe how that might act independent of the acquisition over time and then i have a quick followup hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure so thanks for the question brian as you noticed in the transcript we talked about sort of yeartodate arpu numbers and that being about  or so higher than the same period for last year so obviously looking at it in any given quarter makes it skew up and down but our current plan is really the way we run the business is think about revenue revenue growth what the right products are for our customers what do we need to add to make sure we drive value for the customers and primarily keep indexing towards more subs as long as the lifetime value over the cost of acquiring the customer those economics make sense to us in terms of returns so i think that you could probably ask us most metrics about the business and wed know them pretty well pretty rapidly but arpu is one that typically tends to be an output for our business versus an input we dont drive the business for arpu we drive it for subscriber growth thats part of the reason why we wanted to put that slide out there today which shows that recurring trend of customers starting at a lower price point whether theyre active customers or customers that have stayed for us with for a time and canceled both those data sets you see the very compelling trajectory as they go from a lower price point to north of  for the active customer so when you know youve got those kinds of economics it makes rational business sense for us to keep indexing towards higher subs so thinking about arpu being flat or in the kind of same trajectory weve had it is probably okay as long as were getting the growth from good high quality customers where subscriber acquisition cost is reasonable and the unit economics hold we will continue to keep skewing towards that because that makes the best sense for long term brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc okay thats – cohort analysis is very helpful so thank you for that and then on the constant contact side maybe just a quick comment in terms of how long youve been speaking with the company and was it a competitive process and will you give us the visibility that theyve given their investors historically over customer growth churn and arpu growth hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director so the metrics were still kind of working our way into what makes sense for the combined business going into next year brian but obviously on a simple pro forma basis we just took their total revenues our revenues plus their subs plus ours our arpu would go up quite a bit but from our standpoint the way we tend to look at the business is once constant contact is integrated onto our platform and the teams are working closely together we would look at growth from all of our different gateways and the constant contact product or perhaps some additional variations of the constant contact brand as we talked about on the transcript would end up becoming one gateway of many that we would be looking to spend marketing dollars on and wed want to look at yields on marketing because it becomes a capital deployment decision as to what were spending on that gateway what the lifetime value of the customer looks like what does churn look like what kind of products are they buying incremental and what the cashoncash returns look like for that kind of a sub versus a traditional web presence sub and that would drive a lot of the decisionmaking because from our standpoint we have a lot of tools and a lot of areas to put marketing dollars to work to and this becomes an incremental one but as always we would aspire to make sure that the market is aware of how were thinking about this what the right metrics are to be able gauge it and we hope to come back with something fairly thoughtful next year that would give you guys some comfort brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc okay very helpful thank you hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director oh im sorry and brian on the how long have we been speaking brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc yeah hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director we have – weve known constant contact brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc i know theyre right down the street hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director yeah exactly so weve known them since the late s from when they were roving software so weve known the company for a long time and this part of the negotiation has been going on from the beginning part of this year maybe late last year so working with morgan stanley whos represented them on the sell side brian l essex  morgan stanley  co llc right okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gregg moskowitz of cowen and company your line is now open gregg s moskowitz  cowen  co llc okay thank you very much and good morning to everyone hari based on what you disclosed it seems that youre expecting over  million in ebitda synergies which is a fairly large number thats just based on i guess the sort of the multiple of constant contact and where you think that goes to post synergies i know you said cost savings should be  million by end of year one on a run rate basis i think marc also said you should realize at least  million of cost synergies in the full year of  so if im not mistaken there is a fairly meaningful revenue synergy that is being baked into the model so any additional color that you could provide on how you get there both on the top line and through cost would be helpful thanks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure so just to clarify gregg the  million number as we kind of mentioned in the transcript does not include any crossselling or revenue synergies thats primarily anticipated to be on just the costsaving side if you think about the levers for cost saving obviously there are multiple ones there are overlap costs obviously as two public companies there is basically perhaps some overlap cost on sort of the way the teams are organized et cetera what the platform on a combined basis looks like we do have a large marketing funnel that provides some potential there as well in terms of being able to drive as we mentioned in the transcript just for the last few months or so through the partnership were driving about  of the gross signups into constant contact now to us thats obviously incrementally zero dollars of marketing spend because those are customers already coming into our platform and theres obviously facilities and data centers and things like that that have some overlap as well so the revenue and the crosssell opportunities we think of as further upside the  million were talking about at the end of the year run rate and the  million of realized in  are primarily from the cost side gregg s moskowitz  cowen  co llc okay perfect thanks for the clarification hari and then in the actual quarter itself the net adds were a little bit lower than we were expecting it was down modestly yearoveryear so any additional color on that would be great thank you hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure happy to so i think on the net subscriber additions for this quarter we had been working through launching multiple product gateways particularly around cloud and wordpress and a few other sort of brands that needed to come out to market that were a little bit delayed as we held our marketing cost kind of constant to be able to kind of put the dollars behind it they have now launched and we anticipate kind of going into  there will be a lot of marketing spend behind those gateways because the initial testing has been quite positive that had sort of a compounding impact both on adjusted revenues the flowthrough to ebitda and on the net subscribers as well so its just – nothing is shifted dramatically in the business its just a time shift of some of the launches that have pushed off the sub and the associated revenue growth out into  gregg s moskowitz  cowen  co llc okay got it thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from brian fitzgerald of jefferies your line is now open brian p fitzgerald  jefferies llc thanks guys a couple quick questions i think you mentioned on the call that you see getting a halfturn improvement in the leverage in  still consistent with your longterm view and where you want the leverage of the business to be and then if you could remind us on the constant contact side any noticeable difference in terms of the characteristics of the smbs and we know youve been working or partnering with them for a while maybe any comments around the overlap of the customer bases thanks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director so i got the second part of the question brian we had a little crossnoise here from something would you mind repeating the first part again brian p fitzgerald  jefferies llc yeah so the first part was just on the leverage i think you said in  it improves by a half turn still consistent with your longterm view of where you want the leverage of the business to be hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director yeah no so as weve always been fairly explicit with both the analyst community and also with the investors our midterm target around leverage was about ish turns and this obviously puts it a little bit higher but weve also been pretty explicit that if there are good opportunities that we have a lot of conviction around we dont mind increasing leverage for short spurts or short windows of time where it does spike up a bit this is one of those situations the way we think about it this is a significant asset with a lot of both the revenue and kind of cost upside to us and a very strategic product for our customer base so we think of this one as something where leverage going up a little bit doesnt particularly bother us given how accretive this is to both free cash flow and to ebitda over the course of next year so if you look at the numbers that marc provided which was on a realized basis about  million of ebitda for  exiting the year without the incremental growth into  of  million which is the rest of synergies that you would not realized and – what you would have executed on but not yet realized until  the leverage ratio has come down about a half turn of that exit value and then theres obviously additional growth that comes into  so we would think that in the midterm wed want to kind of get back very quickly to that  turns or less of leverage and we feel pretty comfortable doing that and then on the difference in the types of smbs its amazing the overlap of the customer base here is something that was very exciting to us theres maybe a slightly larger indexing of nonprofits in the constant contact base but the business from a subscriber composition looks very very similar to endurance wed known that going into the transaction given the partnership weve had and the amount of signups weve been driving and how much opportunity and excitement there was within our own customer base but this fits its a different product than some of the other ma activities weve taken on but it is something that we understand were very familiar with the base is very very similar to our own base and we think that the game plan of how were planning on going around to both realizing the synergies and driving more incremental value in the long term is very similar to some of the other ma weve done in the past brian p fitzgerald  jefferies llc great thanks hari operator thank you our next question comes from jason helfstein of oppenheimer your line is now open jason s helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc broker hey thanks two questions and first congratulations on the deal so hari it does seem like there just overall has been some headwind to subscriber growth is there anything youre seeing out there from a competitive aspect that other companies are doing or that youre seeing change in customer behavior where youre kind of not hitting the numbers that you want to hit and you – part of this  is addressing this with greater functionality and kind of working on the product portfolio and then the second question can you help us understand the organic outlook for next year so if you strip out constant contact what does it imply for subscriber arpu collections and ebitda growth thanks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure on the headwind side of it i think some of the headwinds weve created is our own doing more than what see in the macro side theres obviously been some as we mentioned delays in launching some products out the door where were seeing pretty significant customer demand weve been a little bit slow getting out the gate on a few of these products and part of that kind of resulted in us sort of forming a much more agile organization over the course of q as i mentioned in the transcript so with that in place were pretty comfortable that we will continue to keep launching the products we need to be able to capture demand which is part of our core strategy so we dont particularly look at the market and say there is a lot of headwind because a competitive dynamic has set in more now than before its much more that we could be a little bit tighter and do a little bit better job that we plan on doing and have already started going down the path of so less concerns on that piece of it we feel comfortable kind of going into  and  that with the investments weve made we feel good about where things will come out without the constant contact piece of it we guided to adjusted revenues of  to  growth yearoveryear which implies about  million to  million of revenue growth at the low end and high end thats again on a standalone basis ebitda we guided to ballpark about  million without constant contact baked in so we feel good about sort of where the trajectory is on the onramp going into next year and a lot of the work weve done while its been a little bit shifted still feels like it bodes well going into next year and were feeling quite good about the prospects for  at this point jason s helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc broker and then just a quick followup when you think about the marketplace any change in the way you think about longterm acquisition pipeline are there still large enough subscriber transactions out there is the market just feel like its fragmented enough that youd rather address it with a product suite as opposed to historically kind of subscriber acquisition thing  hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director i think in general we still see quite a bit of fragmentation quite a bit of players out there in the core hosting space obviously as we enter other spaces like marketing and online marketing services that opens up other opportunity for other acquisitions in the future there as well but we still feel like theres a lot of subs out there both getting them directly by marketing into it and also by acquiring both bases of customers and moving them to our platform both those opportunities feel intact with at this point and so – and i think one of the earlier questions you had jason was about again the subscriber versus arpu growth we still will keep indexing towards subs and that part of our strategy has not changed at all we still feel good that thats the right way to think about it long term where – especially when you see those vintage cohort charts that we provided i think it makes clear sense as to why one should index more that way if you can jason s helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you operator thank you our next question comes from stephen ju of credit suisse your line is now open stephen ju  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks so hari has the  introductory pricing been fairly consistent throughout  to  or has that been trending down as well and secondarily what are you seeing the overall market on this introductory pricing as you think about your marketing yield you can choose to advertise i guess to reduce introductory pricing so what is the preferred channel for you thanks hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure so on that chart what you see is obviously the active customers that are currently on platform at about  and the subscribers over time that includes the cancellations at around  going up to  i would say again this is more anecdotally this is – i dont have the exact kind of data here but my intuition here is that the introductory pricing started going down in the early s mids time period for the last four years or five years its been low but its been stable on the front end what people were paying for hosting now gets split into both shared hosting and other additional products that they buy as well so the  my gut sense would be that its been pretty consistent without a lot of shift there and given the fact that from a subscriber acquisition cost standpoint our model is purely successbased when you look at the lifetime value of whats left over there is pretty significant cashoncash returns on these subs so we still feel very good about our gotomarket model and we feel that especially as you think about other areas that are outside of the us as well theres still quite a bit of opportunity there for subscriber addition stephen ju  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thanks operator thank you our next question comes from gray powell of wells fargo your line is now open gray w powell  wells fargo securities llc good morning thanks for taking the questions just a couple if i may you may have touched on this in the prepared remarks i just want to make sure i understand correctly what kind of revenue synergies should we think about with the constant contact acquisition that you havent already highlighted in terms of the  million year end  run rate and then also constant contact has a partnership with at least one of your direct competitors do you see any risk to that portion of the business hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure so as we mentioned the  million gray doesnt include any form of revenue synergies associated with that number but from a sort anecdotal standpoint some of the things that we think about and get excited about i can just lay those out for you to consider so if you think about our current customer base weve got  million customers on our platform the thing that our customers ask us for over and over again that theyre willing to spend dollars on is the opportunity for them to have tools that help them grow their business so if you think about kind of integration of multiple things between their web presence and their marketing solutions their email marketing solutions theres a lot of overlap there where you could easily onboard customers into a constant contactlike product with their email list already preloaded that makes them very easy and frictionfree for them to be able to launch their products and to be able to launch their marketing campaigns off the bat when people are coming in through our existing funnel we have opportunities to basically intersect that and see if they would be interested in a more broader bundle of products that would be interesting to them using our web builders and the templated products that we have we could mirror the email campaigns to look exactly like their website so they have one unifying brand across all of their sort of online campaigns whether their sort of email based or web presencebased and again as we expand gateways it provides further opportunities for us to get customers into the constant contact products a little bit cheaper if you dont think about sort of one brand but if you think about a multibrand strategy you could experiment with other things like a freemium model or other sort of good market strategies in pricing which is a little bit harder to do when youve got one kind of premier marquee brand that is going after a segment of customers so all in all we think theres a lot of good opportunities on the revenue growth side none of which has been baked into the numbers or the models weve provided you folks for  at this point gray w powell  wells fargo securities llc got it thats helpful and then just more of a housekeeping question if i may on the arps side can you give us a sense as to what the impact of foreign exchange was on the metric yearoveryear and then also how should we just think about sort of the mix of domestic versus international customers influencing the metric hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure i think in total when we talk about the impact to revenue from foreign exchange it was about  million or so for the quarter  or so and it flowed through into arps again we dont have that calculation but that was sort of the impact of currency on the total revenue for the quarter in terms of the international portion of it again our international yearoveryear total was still about  last q and its still  this year so theres not been a meaningful impact there yet but over time obviously the fx delta was primarily due to the real and our brazil business but over time again we tend to think about it as clt meet the cac  so to the degree that theres an impact on pricing in foreign markets wed want to make sure that the subscriber acquisition cost or the cost to acquire a customer is in line with that lower arpu that we would be able to command in those markets and the lifetime value ratios still hold gray w powell  wells fargo securities llc got it okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from mitch bartlett of craighallum your line is now open mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc sure hari not to beat a dead horse but you talked about in your script you think youve penetrated – or constant contact has penetrated  of your targeted email audience so would that be somewhere around  million folks that youre – if they have  customers and theres – im sure theres some slippage in that number – would you have a targeted email audience within your subscriber base of well over  million hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director so sorry mitch that  number we were referring to was the macro market in terms of how many total customers mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc oh okay hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director are using the email marketing product the penetration rate of constant contact into our base would be much smaller which again weve started deep levels of testing only over the last four months to five months and the results have been really really reinforcing that gave us a lot of conviction around this transaction so we think that there is a significant portion of our customer base that is interested in email marketing that dont have any service provided that theyre currently using and a lot of the difficulty always comes down to how easy and frictionfree can you make it for these customers to be able to use the product and some of things that are difficult for them are to create email lists for example and be able to import them to be able to create collateral or campaigns in an easy way given that we have their website and we already have all of the emails theyre using with their business and the outbound emails are being sent out of our platform we have some good opportunities to make that – make those barriers a little bit simpler as we get a more deeper integration which would be a positive thing in terms of getting people to take this us up on the constant contact product mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc got it thank you so second question would just be on webzai that acquisition the joint venture and the rollout of that product could you talk to that just a little bit more hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure id be happy to that things been going fantastically well we couldnt be more excited about the momentum around that product as folks know that is not included in our numbers so when you think about net additions of subscribers in q or revenue the impact of that jv is not in there until at some point if the company decides to consolidate that and bring that onto our platform entirely but the rampup has been very good its still as we mentioned during investor day were signing up over  customers or so ballpark on a payup  basis on a monthly basis on the product were investing with our partner a good amount of marketing dollars behind that gateway we feel that thats a great market and the ratios have held quite well and i think at this point were probably getting up to about  to plus free sites being set up on a monthly basis so its been pretty good momentum there mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc and when do you anticipate bringing it onto your books hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director still under discussion with our partners and with the company internally but our hope is some time in the near future mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc very good thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of deepak mathivanan your line is now open deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc great thanks two questions first for the quarter itself can you give us what the organic revenue growth was ex the acquisitions from late last year and this year what was the contribution from acquisitions maybe on a dollar basis and then qualitatively can you discuss about the growth profile of some of your bigger brands i have one followup on the product after this hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure deepak i think that probably closest thing youre going to find to that is what you see in the flux  analysis of the earnings materials that theres sort of an increase of about ish million what youll see is about – its hard to break it out because sometimes the growth that comes from the acquisitions get ascribed into the bucket for acquisitions but its about a split of about  million  million – i think  million from the acquisition kit and the other is from the core business however in that  million is also any revenue growth and revenue synergies in that same bucket as well so thats probably the closest were able to break out and i think your question on the profile of growth for larger brands i dont quite follow that can you maybe deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc no im just trying – yeah i was trying to get a sense about what the profile is like for bluehost and hostgator the bigger brands that you have particularly now you have multiple pricing elements into it hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director yeah so thats – i think on the growth side of those brands they continue to perform well theyre going after different segments of the marketplace hostgator is still indexing much more towards customer service bluehost continue to index more towards the technologyfocused customer base with a good partnership with wordpress so theyre both continuing to perform well and all of those would be loaded up into the split of numbers that i gave you that youll find in our q deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc got it okay and then one other question on the product side you mentioned about the delay of offerings related to wordpress and the cloudhosting into late this year what were the factors that caused the delay and then maybe how much of that have you factored into your fy  guidance hari k ravichandran  president chief executive officer  director sure so i think foundationally its basically as we get bigger and bigger there is obviously sort of distributed teams teams that work in different geographies teams that work in different spots and getting everybody aligned sometimes takes a little bit of a concerted effort and i would say where we had some fillings  is that alignment between devops sysops product and marketing sometimes as you get bigger and bigger tend to go even if its slightly offkilter then delivery of products end up slipping so what weve done is gone back and reorganized that portion of our business with very clear lines of organization into clear leadership with clear lines of accountability so we think that delivery will get better and faster it already has and so we feel confident in terms of the  numbers because a lot of that is baked on things that we have a high degree of comfort or have already launched and we see the ramp into it and certainly want to be cognizant of the fact were accounting for any mistakes weve made not being factored into future guidance were providing the market deepak mathivanan  deutsche bank securities inc
