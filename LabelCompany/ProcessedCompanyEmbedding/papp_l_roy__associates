november   september   july   june   january   december   august  july  january  december  october  december  october  june  december  november  december  views from camelback is published twice a year with additional issues as market conditions warrant  we invite you to join our mailing list for this and other updates     views from camelback real problems that will eventually need real solutions december   our country has just endured a presidential election that achieved a new level of hostility and polarization  it involved everything from childish name calling to arguments mainly about irrelevant issues  today we would like to focus on four important longterm problems that the election debate overlooked  these are serious problems that need solutions  these problems are unlikely to derail our economy or our society in the shortterm but they will cause serious damage to our country in the longterm if not addressed  the first item that neither candidate wished to talk about was the deficit and the national debt  we are currently approaching  trillion dollars of accumulated national debt two thirds of which was accumulated under the last two presidents over the previous sixteen years  it is even more remarkable that we ran up this debt balance while experiencing record low interest rates  it now appears that the federal reserve will gradually allow interest rates to rise to their equilibrium level  as this occurs the service cost on our  trillion dollar mortgage will quickly worsen the deficit  donald trump supporters will argue that growth will solve the problem  directionally growth will help  unfortunately the deficit is so significant and the debt so large that even significant economic growth will not solve this problem  longterm our government needs the political resolve to reduce expenditures and raise more revenue  the main driver of the deficit growth is entitlement expenditures which are exacerbated by our aging population the second issue is the growth rate of health care costs which have now reached approximately  of us gdp  there was much discussion both pro and con about the affordable care act during the election but no one seems willing to address the rapid increase in health care costs  again an aging population that is facing incredibly expensive health challenges such as alzheimer’s care makes matters worse  this is one sector where technological improvements do not necessarily equate to lower costs but instead often drives costs even higher  the affordable care act with all of its flaws was about access not cost control  other nations are also experiencing rapidly increasing costs albeit from a lower level the third issue is education  progressives want to allocate more funding for schools while conservatives want charter schools and other methods to bring competition to education in the hope of lowering costs and improving outcomes  in reality the solution requires both additional resources and structural reforms  this problem is particularly acute in arizona where funding levels are entirely inadequate and structural reforms have produced mixed results  it is hard to believe that the abundance of knowledge that the us needs to develop may be produced only by the children of wealthy families who are able to provide their children access to superior educational opportunities  all children need to have access to  quality education finally we wish to touch on the environment where almost all reasonable people agree that human beings are having a dramatic impact on the environmental health of our planet  the political debate on this issue was on how effective or not various environmental programs have been  governments around the world have had a poor track record of developing costeffective solutions to this serious problem  we believe the solution lies in technology  arizona state university’s president michael crow has remarked that while electronic communication and medical technologies have advanced enormously in the past  years humankind’s energy strategy with the exception of nuclear energy and all of its issues has not changed that much in the last  years  our strategy is to cut it down and set it on fire or dig it or pump it out of the ground and set it on fire  we can surely do better and eventually we will have to  these are all tough issues and that is why politicians have avoided dealing with them  longterm our country as well as the rest of the world needs to identify and implement successful environmental strategies  we are confident that the united states can lead the world towards solving all of these issues despite tough longterm issues we remain optimistic about our country and our prospects  even with all of our problems we remain the envy of the world in terms of intellectual freedom technological development opportunity for graduate level education and economic vitality  people from many areas of the world are eager to come to the united states because they recognize the opportunities the us offers  as investors we observe that stocks are hitting record highs but in our opinion they remain at the upper end of normal valuation ranges  we will continue to experience economic and market cycles and future recessions have not been eliminated  at this point we do not see significant risks for a near term recession and we believe we are more likely to see a little faster growth which should help both corporate earnings and wages  if this happens as we expect the market can grow into the current high valuation levels and continue to appreciate all of us here at l roy papp  associates llp wish you and your family a healthy happy and prosperous new year     best regards harry
