life and educationedit brin was born in moscow in the soviet union to russian jewish parents yevgenia and mikhail brin both graduates of moscow state university msu his father is a mathematics professor at the university of maryland and his mother a researcher at nasas goddard space flight center in may  when brin was five years old his family felt compelled to emigrate out of the soviet union in an interview with mark malseed coauthor of the google story sergeys father explained how he was forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached college he said communist party heads barred jews from upper professional ranks by denying them entry to universities jews were excluded from the physics department in particular at the prestigious moscow state university because soviet leaders did not trust them with nuclear rocket research mikhail brin therefore changed his major to mathematics where he received nearly straight as in another interview with dominic lawson of the independent mikhail said no one would consider me for graduate school because i was jewish he went on to tell lawson how msu required jews to take their entrance exams in different rooms from nonjewish applicants and how they were marked on a harsher scale the brin family lived in a threeroom apartment in central moscow which they also shared with sergeys paternal grandmother brin told malseed ive known for a long time that my father wasnt able to pursue the career he wanted but brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the united states in  after his father returned from a mathematics conference in warsaw poland mikhail brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate we cannot stay here any more he told his wife and mother at the conference he was able to mingle freely with colleagues from the united states france england and germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the west were not monsters he added i was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave sergeys mother was less willing to leave their home in moscow where they had spent their entire lives malseed writes for genia the decision ultimately came down to sergey while her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his sons for her it was  about sergey they formally applied for their exit visa in september  and as a result his father was promptly fired for related reasons his mother also had to leave her job for the next eight months without any steady income they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks during this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming in may  they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country at an interview in october  brin said i know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very thankful that i was brought to the states in  brin later recalled i came here to the us at age six with my family from the soviet union which was at that time the greatest enemy the us had it was a dire period the cold war as some people remember it it was under the threat of nuclear annihilation and even then the us had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees in the summer of  a few weeks before his th birthday his father led a group of high school math students including sergey on a twoweek exchange program to the soviet union his roommate on the trip was future carnegie mellon university computer science professor john stamper as brin recalls the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that his first impulse on confronting soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car malseed adds on the second day of the trip while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near moscow brin took his father aside looked him in the eye and said thank you for taking us all out of russia brin attended elementary school at paint branch montessori school in adelphi maryland but he received further education at home his father a professor in the department of mathematics at the university of maryland encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his russianlanguage skills he attended eleanor roosevelt high school in greenbelt maryland in september  brin enrolled in the university of maryland where he received his bachelor of science from the department of computer science in  with honors in computer science and mathematics which is part of the university of maryland college of computer mathematical and natural sciences brin began his graduate study in computer science at stanford university on a graduate fellowship from the national science foundation in  he interned at wolfram research the developers of mathematica as of update he was on leave from his phd studies at stanford search engine developmentedit during an orientation for new students at stanford he met larry page they seemed to disagree on most subjects but after spending time together they became intellectual soulmates and close friends brins focus was on developing data mining systems while pages was in extending the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers together the pair authored a paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another page and sergey brin combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users by early  the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august th  total indexable html urls  million total content downloaded  gigabytes  backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts‍—‌originally replicated by hand‍—‌to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information other interestsedit brin is working on other more personal projects that reach beyond google for example he and page are trying to help solve the worlds energy and climate problems at googles philanthropic arm googleorg which invests in the alternative energy industry to find wider sources of renewable energy the company acknowledges that its founders want to solve really big problems using technology in october  for example they invested in a major offshore wind power development to assist the east coast power grid which will eventually become one of about a dozen offshore wind farms that are proposed for the region a week earlier they introduced a car that with artificial intelligence can drive itself using video cameras and radar sensors in the future drivers of cars with similar sensors would have fewer accidents these safer vehicles could therefore be built lighter and require less fuel consumption they are trying to get companies to create innovative solutions to increasing the worlds energy supply he is an investor in tesla motors which has developed the tesla roadster a mile  km range battery electric vehicle as well as the tesla model s a mile  km range battery electric vehicle in  he and page were named persons of the week by abc world news tonight in january  he was nominated to be one of the world economic forums young global leaders in june  brin invested  million in space adventures the virginiabased space tourism company his investment will serve as a deposit for a reservation on one of space adventures proposed flights in  space adventures the only company that sends tourists to space has sent five of them so far brin and page jointly own a customized boeing  and a dornier alpha jet and pay  million a year to house them and two gulfstream v jets owned by google executives at moffett federal airfield the aircraft have had scientific equipment installed by nasa to allow experimental data to be collected in flight in  brin has been involved with the project glass program and has demoed eyeglass prototypes project glass is a research and development program by google to develop an augmented reality headmounted display hmd the intended purpose of project glass products would be the handsfree displaying of information currently available to most smartphone users and allowing for interaction with the internet via natural language voice commands brin was also involved in the google driverless car project in september  at the signing of the california driverless vehicle bill brin predicted that within five years robotic cars will be available to the general public brin is a supporter of labgrown meat and kiteenergy systems the economist magazine describes brins approach to life like pages as based on a vision summed up by googles motto of making all the worlds information universally accessible and useful censorship of google in chinaedit for more details on this topic see censorship in the peoples republic of china remembering his youth and his familys reasons for leaving the soviet union he agonized over googles decision to appease the communist government of china by allowing it to censor search engine results but he decided that the chinese would still be better off than without having google available on january   google reported a large cyber attack on its computers and corporate infrastructure that began a month earlier which included accessing two gmail accounts and the theft of googles intellectual property after the attack was determined to have originated in china the company stated that it would no longer agree to censor its search engine in china and may exit the country altogether david drummond googles senior vice president of corporate development reported that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the gmail accounts of chinese human rights activists but that the attack also targeted  other large companies in the finance technology media and chemical sectors it was later reported that the attack had also targeted one of googles crown jewels a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwide in late march  it officially discontinued its chinabased search engine while keeping its uncensored hong kong site in operation speaking for google brin stated during an interview one of the reasons i am glad we are making this move in china is that the china situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls during another interview with der spiegel he added for us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the internet we believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the internet senator byron dorgan stated that googles decision is a strong step in favor of freedom of expression and information and congressman bob goodlatte said i applaud google for its courageous step to stop censoring search results on googlecn google has drawn a line in the sand and is shining a light on the very dark area of individual liberty restrictions in china from the business perspective many recognize that the move is likely to affect googles profits the new republic adds that google seems to have arrived at the same link that was obvious to andrei sakharov the one between science and freedom referring to the move as heroism personal lifeedit sergey brin in  at the web  conference in may  brin married biotech analyst and entrepreneur anne wojcicki in the bahamas they had a son together in december  and a daughter in late  in august  it was announced that brin and his thenwife were living separately after brin had become romantically involved with google glasss marketing director in june  brin and wojcicki finalized their divorce brins mother eugenia has been diagnosed with parkinsons disease in  he decided to make a donation to the university of maryland school of medicine where his mother is being treated brin used the services of andme and discovered that although parkinsons is generally not hereditary both he and his mother possess a mutation of the lrrk gene gs that puts the likelihood of him developing parkinsons in later years between  and  when asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease an editorial in the economist magazine states that mr brin regards his mutation of lrrk as a bug in his personal code and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that google’s engineers fix every day by helping himself he can therefore help others as well he considers himself lucky  but mr brin was making a much bigger point isn’t knowledge always good and certainly always better than ignorance brin and his exwife also run the brin wojcicki

father aside looked him in the eye and said thank you for taking us all out of russia brin attended elementary school at paint branch montessori school in adelphi maryland but he received further

he attended eleanor roosevelt high school in greenbelt maryland in september  brin enrolled in the university of maryland where he received his bachelor of science from the department of computer science in  with honors in computer science and mathematics which is part of the university of maryland college of computer mathematical and natural sciences brin began his graduate study in computer

became intellectual soulmates and close friends brins focus was on developing data mining systems while pages was in extending the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers together the pair authored a paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another page and sergey brin combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website

figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts‍—‌originally replicated by hand‍—‌to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information other interestsedit brin is working on other more personal projects that reach beyond google for example he and page are trying to help solve the worlds energy and climate problems at googles philanthropic arm googleorg which invests in the alternative energy industry to find wider sources of renewable energy the company acknowledges that its founders want to solve really big problems using technology in october  for example they invested in a major offshore wind power development to assist the east coast power grid which will eventually become one of about a dozen offshore wind farms that are proposed for the region a week earlier they introduced a car that with artificial intelligence can drive itself using video cameras and radar sensors in the future drivers of cars with similar sensors would have fewer accidents these safer vehicles could therefore be built lighter and require less fuel consumption they are trying to get companies to create innovative solutions to increasing the worlds energy supply he is an investor in tesla motors which has developed the tesla roadster a mile  km range battery electric vehicle as well as the tesla model s a mile  km range battery electric vehicle in  he and page were named persons of the week by abc world news tonight in january  he was

installed by nasa to allow experimental data to be collected in flight in  brin has been involved with the project glass program and has demoed eyeglass prototypes project glass is a research and development program by google to develop an augmented reality headmounted display hmd the intended purpose of project glass products would be the handsfree displaying of information currently

signing of the california driverless vehicle bill brin predicted that within five years robotic cars will be available to the general public brin is a supporter of labgrown meat and kiteenergy systems the economist magazine describes brins approach to life like pages as based on a vision summed up by googles motto of making all the worlds information universally accessible and useful censorship of google in chinaedit for more details on this topic see censorship in the peoples republic of china remembering his youth and his familys reasons for leaving the soviet union he agonized over googles decision to appease the communist government of china by allowing it to censor search engine results but he decided that the chinese would still be better off than without having google available on january   google reported a large cyber attack on its computers and corporate infrastructure that began a month earlier which included accessing two gmail accounts and the theft of googles intellectual property after the attack was determined to have originated in china the company stated that it would no longer agree to censor its search engine in china and may exit the country altogether david drummond googles senior vice president of corporate development reported that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the gmail accounts of chinese human rights activists but that the attack also targeted  other large companies in the finance technology media and chemical sectors it was later reported that the attack had also targeted one of googles crown jewels a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwide in late march  it officially discontinued its chinabased search engine while keeping its uncensored hong kong site in operation speaking for google brin stated during an interview one of the reasons i am glad we are making this move in china is that the china situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls during another interview with der spiegel he added for us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the internet we believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the internet senator byron dorgan stated that googles decision is a strong step in favor of freedom of expression and information and congressman bob goodlatte said i applaud google for its courageous step to stop censoring search results on googlecn google has drawn a line in the sand and is shining a light on the very dark area of individual liberty restrictions in china from the business perspective many recognize that the move is likely to affect googles profits the new republic adds that google seems to have arrived at the same link that was obvious to andrei sakharov the one between science and freedom referring to the move as heroism personal lifeedit sergey brin in  at the web  conference in may  brin married biotech analyst and entrepreneur anne wojcicki in the bahamas they had a son together in december  and a daughter in late  in august  it was announced that brin and his thenwife were living separately after brin had become romantically involved with google glasss marketing director in june  brin and wojcicki finalized their divorce brins mother eugenia has been diagnosed with parkinsons disease in  he decided to make a donation to the university of maryland school of medicine where his mother is being treated brin used the services of andme and discovered that although parkinsons is generally not hereditary both he and his mother possess a mutation of the lrrk gene gs that puts the likelihood of him developing parkinsons in later years between  and  when asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease an editorial in the economist magazine states that mr brin regards his mutation of lrrk as a bug in his personal code and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that google’s engineers fix every day by helping himself he can therefore help others as well he considers himself lucky  but mr brin was making a much bigger point isn’t knowledge always good and certainly always better than ignorance brin and his exwife also run the brin wojcicki

life and educationedit brin was born in moscow in the soviet union to russian jewish parents yevgenia and mikhail brin both graduates of moscow state university msu his father is a mathematics professor at the university of maryland and his mother a researcher at nasas goddard space flight center in may  when brin was five years old his family felt compelled to emigrate out of the soviet union in an interview with mark malseed coauthor of the google story sergeys father explained how he was forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached college he said communist party heads barred jews from upper professional ranks by denying them entry to universities jews were excluded from the physics department in particular at the prestigious moscow state university because soviet leaders did not trust them with nuclear rocket research mikhail brin therefore changed his major to mathematics where he received nearly straight as in another interview with dominic lawson of the independent mikhail said no one would consider me for graduate school because i was jewish he went on to tell lawson how msu required jews to take their entrance exams in different rooms from nonjewish applicants and how they were marked on a harsher scale the brin family lived in a threeroom apartment in central moscow which they also shared with sergeys paternal grandmother brin told malseed ive known for a long time that my father wasnt able to pursue the career he wanted but brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the united states in  after his father returned from a mathematics conference in warsaw poland mikhail brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate we cannot stay here any more he told his wife and mother at the conference he was able to mingle freely with colleagues from the united states france england and germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the west were not monsters he added i was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave sergeys mother was less willing to leave their home in moscow where they had spent their entire lives malseed writes for genia the decision ultimately came down to sergey while her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his sons for her it was  about sergey they formally applied for their exit visa in september  and as a result his father was promptly fired for related reasons his mother also had to leave her job for the next eight months without any steady income they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks during this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming in may  they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country at an interview in october  brin said i know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very thankful that i was brought to the states in  brin later recalled i came here to the us at age six with my family from the soviet union which was at that time the greatest enemy the us had it was a dire period the cold war as some people remember it it was under the threat of nuclear annihilation and even then the us had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees in the summer of  a few weeks before his th birthday his father led a group of high school math students including sergey on a twoweek exchange program to the soviet union his roommate on the trip was future carnegie mellon university computer science professor john stamper as brin recalls the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that his first impulse on confronting soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car malseed adds on the second day of the trip while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near moscow brin took his

decision to appease the communist government of china by allowing it to censor search engine results but he decided that the chinese would still be better off than without having google available on january   google reported a large cyber attack on its computers and corporate infrastructure that began a month earlier which included accessing two gmail accounts and the theft of googles intellectual property after the attack was determined to have originated in china the company stated that it would no longer agree to censor its search engine in china and may exit the country altogether david drummond googles senior vice president of corporate development reported that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the gmail accounts of chinese human rights activists but that the attack also targeted  other large companies in the finance technology media and chemical sectors it was later reported that the attack had also targeted one of googles crown jewels a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwide in late march  it officially discontinued its chinabased search engine while keeping its uncensored hong kong site in operation speaking for google brin stated during an interview one of the reasons i am glad we are making this move in china is that the china situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls during another interview with der spiegel he added for us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the internet we believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the internet senator byron dorgan stated that googles decision is a strong step in favor of freedom of expression and information and congressman bob goodlatte said i applaud google for its courageous step to stop censoring search results on googlecn google has drawn a line in the sand and is shining a light on the very dark area of individual liberty restrictions in china from the business perspective many recognize that the move is likely to affect googles profits the new republic adds that google seems to have arrived at the same link that was obvious to andrei sakharov the one between science and freedom referring to the move as heroism personal lifeedit sergey brin in  at the web  conference in may

parkinsons is generally not hereditary both he and his mother possess a mutation of the lrrk gene gs that puts the likelihood of him developing parkinsons in later years between  and  when asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease an editorial in the economist magazine states that mr brin regards his mutation of lrrk as a bug in his personal code and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that google’s engineers fix every day by helping himself he can therefore help others as well he considers himself lucky  but mr brin was making a much bigger point isn’t knowledge always good and certainly always better than ignorance brin and his exwife also run the brin wojcicki

the united states with his family from the soviet union at the age of  he earned his bachelors degree at the university of maryland following in his fathers and grandfathers footsteps by studying mathematics as well as computer science after graduation he enrolled in stanford university to acquire a phd in computer science there he met page with whom he later became friends they crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied brins data mining system to build a web search engine the program became popular at stanford and they suspended their phd studies to start up google in a rented garage the economist referred to brin as an enlightenment man and as someone who believes that knowledge is always good and certainly always better than ignorance a philosophy that

life and educationedit brin was born in moscow in the soviet union to russian jewish parents yevgenia and mikhail brin both graduates of moscow state university msu his father is a mathematics professor at the university of maryland and his mother a researcher at nasas goddard space flight center in may  when brin was five years old his family felt compelled to emigrate out of the soviet union in an interview with mark malseed coauthor of the google story sergeys father explained how he was forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached college he said communist party heads barred jews from upper professional ranks by denying them entry to universities jews were excluded from the physics department in particular at the prestigious moscow state university because soviet leaders did not trust them with nuclear rocket research mikhail brin therefore changed his major to mathematics where he received nearly straight as in another interview with dominic lawson of the independent mikhail said no one would consider me for graduate school because i was jewish he went on to tell lawson how msu required jews to take their entrance exams in different rooms from nonjewish applicants and how they were marked on a harsher scale the brin family lived in a threeroom apartment in central moscow which they also shared with sergeys paternal grandmother brin told malseed ive known for a long time that my father wasnt able to pursue the career he wanted but brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the united states in  after his father returned from a mathematics conference in warsaw poland mikhail brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate we cannot stay here any more he told his wife and mother at the conference he was able to mingle freely with colleagues from the united states france england and germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the west were not monsters he added i was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave sergeys mother was less willing to leave their home in moscow where they had spent their entire lives malseed writes for genia the decision ultimately came down to sergey while her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his sons for her it was  about sergey they formally applied for their exit visa in september  and as a result his father was promptly fired for related reasons his mother also had to leave her job for the next eight months without any steady income they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks during this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming in may  they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country at an interview in october  brin said i know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very thankful that i was brought to the states in  brin later recalled i came here to the us at age six with my family from the soviet union which was at that time the greatest enemy the us had it was a dire period the cold war as some people remember it it was under the threat of nuclear annihilation and even then the us had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees in the summer of  a few weeks before his th birthday his father led a group of high school math students including sergey on a twoweek exchange program to the soviet union his roommate on the trip was future carnegie mellon university computer science professor john stamper as brin recalls the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that his first impulse on confronting soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car malseed adds on the second day of the trip while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near moscow brin took his father aside looked him in the eye and said thank you for taking us all out of russia brin attended elementary school at paint branch montessori school in adelphi maryland but he received further education at home his father a professor in the department of mathematics at the university of maryland encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his russianlanguage skills he attended eleanor roosevelt high school in greenbelt maryland in september  brin enrolled in the university of maryland where he received his bachelor of science from the department of computer science in  with honors in computer science and mathematics which is part of the university of maryland college of computer mathematical and natural sciences brin began his graduate study in computer science at stanford university on a graduate fellowship from the national science foundation in  he interned at wolfram research the developers of mathematica as of update he was on leave from his phd studies at stanford search engine developmentedit during an orientation for new students at stanford he met larry page they seemed to disagree on most subjects but after spending time together they became intellectual soulmates and close friends brins focus was on developing data mining systems while pages was in extending the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers together the pair authored a paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another page and sergey brin combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users by early  the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august th  total indexable html urls  million total content downloaded  gigabytes  backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts‍—‌originally replicated by hand‍—‌to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information other interestsedit brin is working on other more personal projects that reach beyond google for example he and page are trying to help solve the worlds energy and climate problems at googles philanthropic arm googleorg which invests in the alternative energy industry to find wider sources of renewable energy the company acknowledges that its founders want to solve really big problems using technology in october  for example they invested in a major offshore wind power development to assist the east coast power grid which will eventually become one of about a dozen offshore wind farms that are proposed for the region a week earlier they introduced a car that with artificial intelligence can drive itself using video cameras and radar sensors in the future drivers of cars with similar sensors would have fewer accidents these safer vehicles could therefore be built lighter and require less fuel consumption they are trying to get companies to create innovative solutions to increasing the worlds energy supply he is an investor in tesla motors which has developed the tesla roadster a mile  km range battery electric vehicle as well as the tesla model s a mile  km range battery electric vehicle in  he and page were named persons of the week by abc world news tonight in january  he was nominated to be one of the world economic forums young global leaders in june  brin invested  million in space adventures the virginiabased space tourism company his investment will serve as a deposit

sergey brin also wants to fly  bloomberg with secret airship sergey brin also wants to fly the google cofounder is said to be working on an enormous dirigible in a silicon valley hangar by ashlee vance valleyhack more stories by ashlee vance april    pm edt larry page has his flying cars sergey brin shall have an airshipbrin the google cofounder has secretly been building a massive airship inside of hangar  at the nasa ames research center according to four people with knowledge of the project its unclear whether the craft which looks like a zeppelin is a hobby or something brin hopes to turn into a business sorry i dont have anything to say about this topic right now brin wrote in an emailthe people familiar with the project said brin has long been fascinated by airships his interest in the crafts started when brin would visit ames which is located next to google parent alphabet incs headquarters in mountain view california in the s ames was home to the uss macon a huge airship built by the us navy about three years ago brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the maconthe uss macon entering hangar one at the nasa ames research center in photographer smith collectiongado via getty images in  google unit planetary ventures took over the large hangars at ames from nasa and turned them into laboratories for the company brins airship which isn’t an alphabet project is already taking shape inside one engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft and it fills up much of the enormous hangaralan weston the former director of programs at nasa ames is leading brins airship project according to the people who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans weston didn’t respond to requests for commentweston has a background befitting such an unusual enterpriseborn to australian parents weston spent some of his youth in turkey and then ended up at the university of oxford there he became a key member of the dangerous sports club  a group of very intelligent risktakers that formed in the early s and did things such as catapult people across fields into netsmembers of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping weston for example performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off california’s golden gate bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore he also hiked mt kilimanjaro in africa and then attempted to hangglide down only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process years later weston joined the air force and did engineering work as part of the us government’s strategic defense initiative  known more broadly as the star wars missile defense system in  weston oversaw one of the first tests of star wars which aimed to destroy incoming russian missiles midair with weapons fired from spacefollowing his stint at the air force weston joined nasa and worked on a wide number of projects including the development of a lowcost lunar landerin a radio interview in  weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo the idea is that airships could be more fuelefficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where theyre needed rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stationsnew airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per tonmile by up to an order of magnitude weston said in the interview it depends on the size of the airship a larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to  tons that could be actually more fuelefficient than even a truck the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up he went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a heliumbased craft that appeared to breathe and so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure he said as you do that air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle so the analogy of breathing is a good one and the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium and as you change that you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle hasthis technique according to weston would allow the airship to carry  tons without the need for a ballast after being contacted about the airship weston changed his profile on linkedin to list his current job as chief executive officer of ltare he then removed the post there have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years its fitting for such a project to take place in silicon valley which seems to have entered a steampunk phase as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rocketsbrin’s airship is separate from a freight project called calcifer that was

has grown to nearly  fulltime employees worldwide and with a steady stream of new product developments acquisitions and partnerships has extended its reach far beyond its modest beginnings as a web search engine perhaps even more impressive is googles image as the pinnacle of cool with a reputation for being hip innovative and wildly successfulall without compromising its dont be evil philosophylarry pages interest in technology began when his father the late carl pagemichigan state professor and pioneer in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligencegave him a computer at the age of six page graduated with honors from the university of michigan with a bachelors degree in engineering and concentration in computer engineering he achieved his undergraduate claim to fame by building an inkjet printer out of lego blockspage worked for a few years in the technology industry before deciding at the age of  to pursue a phd in computer science at stanford university it was there as a prospective student that he met sergey brin who was assigned to show him around the campus brin originally from moscow moved to the us with his family when he was  years old he received his bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science with honors from the university of maryland where his father taught mathematics at stanford he was studying ways to extract patterns and relationships from large amounts of datagoogles own website implies that the two disagreed about most everything during this first meetingbut their friendship was given the chance to blossom in  when brin joined page in his backrub research project exploring backlinkslinks on other websites that refer back to a given webpageas a way to measure the relative importance of a particular site the pair then developed the pagerank algorithm named after page hypothesizing that using this tool they could produce better results than existing search engines which returned rankings based on the number of times a search term appearedthey tested the backrub search engine later that year on stanfords servers without a web developer they kept the search page simple but were challenged to find enough computing power to handle queries as the search engine become increasingly popularat stanford wed stand on the loading dock and try to snag computers as they came in page said in an interview with technology review in  we would see who got  computers and ask them if they could spare onepage and brin eventually renamed the search engine google as a play on the word googol a mathematical term represented by the numeral one followed by  zerosa reflection of their mission to organize the seemingly infinite amount of information on the internetreluctant to leave their studies the duo ran the operation out of their dorm rooms but by mid google was getting  searches a day so finally convinced they maxed out  worth of credit cards to purchase a terabyte of disk space and drafted a business planthings have gone well since then in august  google went public with an ipo that raised  billion and in typical google fashion became the first and only company to allocate its stocks using computers rather than wall street bankers for the quarter ending june   the company reported revenues of  billion an increase of  percent compared to the second quarter of the famous googleplex headquarters in mountain view calif is also something to boast about known for its relaxed atmosphere and envyinducing employee perks like subsidized massages onsite stylists and three free gourmet meals a day the campus currently spans  million square feet of office space and a recent acquisition will soon add another  million square feetgoogles milestones page reads more like a novel than a series of highlights but theres still more to come in a  interview with financial times brin stated theres a lot of room for improvement theres no inherent ceiling were hitting up on and so far thats been the case from the  billion purchase of youtube down to the continued development of the ubiquitously popular googlemaps and picasa photo applicationsto say that google has had a tremendous impact on the internet is the definition of understatement after all the company has already found its way into the vernacularas a verb no less in  the word google was added to the merriam webster dictionary as to use the google search engine to obtain information on the world wide webpage and brin are both on leave from stanford but success has kept them busy they are still

launch in  by daniel p howley laptop senior writer  may    am more googles project glass is the most significant concept to come out of googles x lab since the company fist unveiled its selfdriving car initiative unfortunately no one besides the companys sergey brin has been seen wearing the augmented reality glasses until last week that is brin appeared on current tvs the gavin newsom show to explain and show off a project glass prototype before handing them over to host and lieutenant governor of california gavin newsom who was able to view a picture of himself which brin had previously taken on the glasses screen following the show newsom discussed using the glasses with wired saying the image was remarkably clear googles project glass shown capturing video brin didnt let newsom navigate the glasses menus  although he did demonstrate that a small touchpad on the glasses right arm allows users to move through whatever operating system is loaded on the device  despite the fact that project glass made its public debut a little over a month ago newsom told wired that the device is much further along in development than most people have imagined  the most surprising tidbit brin revealed during his interview was the time frame he is looking at in regards to project glass public availability when newsom asked when the product would hit the market brin replied saying he hoped to have it out sometime next year  brin said the pair of hightech shades he had with him during the interview was actually a rough prototype meaning that the project could still see significant changes before it is made commercially available check out the video below to see portions of the interview and tune in on june  for the newsoms entire interview with brin via current tv wired

more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have we did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time many of those crazy things now have over a billion users like google maps youtube chrome and android and we haven’t stopped there we are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about we’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing just making incremental changes but in the technology industry where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant our company is operating well today but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable so we are creating a new company called alphabet i am really excited to be running alphabet as ceo with help from my capable partner sergey as president what is alphabet alphabet is mostly a collection of companies the largest of which of course is google this newer google is a bit slimmed down with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in alphabet instead what do we mean by far afield good examples are our health efforts life sciences that works on the glucosesensing contact lens andcalico focused on longevity fundamentally we believe this allows us more management scale as we can run things independently that aren’t very related alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence in general our model is to have a strong ceo who runs each business with sergey and me in service to them as needed we will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well well also make sure we have a great ceo for each business and we’ll determine their compensation in addition with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our q results where google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of alphabet businesses as a whole this new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of google a key part of this is sundar pichai sundar has been saying the things i would have said and sometimes better for quite some time now and i’ve been tremendously enjoying our work together he has really stepped up since october of last year when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses sergey and i have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company and it is clear to us and our board that it is time for sundar to be ceo of google i feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations i have been spending quite a bit of time with sundar helping him and the company in any way i can and i will of course continue to do that google itself is also making all sorts of new products and i know sundar will always be focused on innovation—continuing to stretch boundaries i know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the worlds information recent launches like google photos and google now using machine learning are amazing progress google also has some services that are run with their own identity like youtube susan is doing a great job as ceo running a strong brand and driving incredible growth sergey and i are seriously in the business of starting new things alphabet will also include our x lab which incubates new efforts like wing our drone delivery effort we are also stoked about growing our investment arms ventures and capital as part of this new structure alphabet inc will replace google inc as the publiclytraded entity and all shares of google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of alphabet with all of the same rights google will become a whollyowned subsidiary of alphabet our two classes of shares will continue to trade on nasdaq as googl and goog for sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of google—the birth of alphabet we liked the name alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanitys most important innovations and is the core of how we index with google search we also like that it means alpha‑bet alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for i should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products—the whole point is that alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands we are excited about getting more ambitious things done taking the longterm view empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see improving the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing making google even better through greater focus and hopefully as a result of all this improving the lives of as many people as we can what could be better no wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the alphabet family don’t worry we’re still getting used to the name too larry get the
