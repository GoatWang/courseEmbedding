form script that wasnt difficult to use or understandafter reading about huggins free email form script on cheryl wises expression web forum i went to his web site and downloaded the script files along with the user manual which is quite extensivewell to keep it short i was able to modify the scripts and load them to my web site after relocating the site to a hosting service that supported pure php this was done through the outstanding support from james huggins he went far beyond what i expected from a tech support point of view his concern with my problem was genuine and his guidance in getting the script on the new hosting service was greatly appreciatedif you are looking for an email form script to use you cannot get a better one than huggins free email form script and the best tech support i ever receivedi cannot say thank you enough for james assistancei have used the form on elizabethfilholmcom and am in the process of placing it on my other web sitesron childs real time marketing incrjlinfocommar i have once before written a testimonial thanking james for all the hard work he has done to help many other other people and also in sharing his time and knowledge to enable many people to use his excellent work for free since i last wrote i have had to contact james once again due to me wanting to modify my contact form it is because of this i feel compelled to write once again thanking james and singing his praises from my initial contact james once again replied within the hour and he has patiently stuck with me for around  days while i rectified my problemwhen i cannot do something i want to know the reason why and rather than james just rectifying the problem he has walked me through each step while giving me guidance which meant that i needed to study the code and ultimately learn what it all meant if i got stuck and could not go any further he would then explain what i needed to do i can not thank him enough for his patience knowledge and help if you genuinely want a form that works and does what it says then you definately have to use the huggins script his manual may not be to everyones taste but it is nowhere near as daunting as it first looks to get a basic form working is very very easy and with jamess support no one could ask for anything more once again thank you jamescharles archer director wwwjusticeeveryonecouk apr the huggins email form script is an amazingly easy solution for very flexible and customizable php contact forms as soon as my team and i took a look at it we were sold  except its free we are not php developers and dont intend to be php experts any time soon this extremely well written and flexible script has kept us out of the business of having to do that whats more we were very happily surprised to find out that not only does james fully support his product but he is dedicated to helping folks make sure that it works for them we received replies for information within minutesfantastic customer service lane giffordboldlinesservcorpcom may jhuggins email scriptworks like a charm it appears to be bulky until you understand that only a few tweaks make it work for you the script is easy to implement  just read the instructions  but like all instructions its best if the designer of them were right there guiding you and here is where the support is fantastic if you need help you can easily get friendly patient assistance by phone andor email personally from james because of this i recommend trying his brilliantly written free script brilliant because of the checks and cross checks it automatically does so that when you get email its legitimate and cross checked for malicious code thanks james for all your help  bill sinclair wwwchristiankeysca dec hi james i want to thank you for your email form script and sharing your expertise with the world im a complete novice where building websites is concerned and am still in the throes of coming to grips with microsoft expression it was on the expression forums that i discovered the existence of the huggins email form script when i needed to set up a secure email form for a website that im developing thats when the fun started i must admit i found your documentation a little daunting at first until i stopped skimming and started to follow the structure and logic of what you were trying to present in your manual  its comprehensive its clear and unambiguous and it lead me carefully through the building process it all fell into place nicely and i surprised myself at how quickly i was able to have a working email form set up tested and running  now heres the biggest surprise of all when i struck a problem that i wasnt able to resolve on the verge of abandoning the huggins solution i decided to contact you on the off chance you might respond i was delighted and grateful to receive a level of support from you that was prompt effective and personal indeed as a senior manager in the high end computer industry for many years in australia i have rarely come across such enthusiasm and commitment to getting a clients problem resolved in the quickest possible timeand you dont even know me thank you again james the huggins email form script is a great product thats professionally supported and easy to implement needless to say ill be using it again in future projects and of course i will ensure i dont miss an opportunity to recommend it to anyone with whom the subject of secure web forms is raised vic kenney asia pacific technical support manager retired safety beach melbourne australia nov heres what i told my dreamweaver class and anyone that will listen i also use the form for our curling clubs contact page and club members love it youll find really good tools to make forms in dreamweaver youll find excellent extensions too you can even find terrific wizards or form generators online like accessifys quick form builder but none of them tell you how to implement the form without incurring a lot of spam how to make the form secure and make it actually work to deliver to you usable and understandable information most importantly its the connection you need between you and your clients except for huggins free email form script at first the contents in the huggins form mail folder looks intimidating and hard to install but it isnt at all just read the manual and follow the instructions if you have a problem and you contact james he will respond and help you find the answer you need fantastic search no further heres two examples of a simple contact formuofgtscomdreamcontacthtml wwwevergreencurlingcomaboutcontactphp thanks james garry stasiuk uofgtscom nov  hello james like some others i found your script through google to be honest i was kinda wary of it because of previous failures with properly setting up an email form after some trial and failure finally got the hang of it and it worked like a charm ever since what impressed me so much out of the learning process is your documentation the amount of information it packed has helped me enormously to understand how the script and its setting work i most definitely recommend it to others leo lin g orbital complex   custom action figure portal wwwgorbitalnet jun  james i want to thank you for all your help and time i am new to designing and the guy i host with said that if i ever want to be a web master i would need to know the information located at your sight after checking it out and getting all the necessary documents i was a bit overwhelmed and confused when i contacted you i was amazed at the customer service you provide mine is not a small or simple form by any means and i am just awestruck at the time and effort you put forth on this for someone you dont even know if you would like to use the site as an example of what can be done with this form script please feel free  httpwwwjarheadtopcomorderformhtm once again i want to thank you for a job well done maria borneman jafeica publishing inc office manager and one day web master mar  james i want to thank you for your continuing work on the form script like many others i was left somewhat adrift when frontpage extensions began disappearing from servers having switched to expression web i knew that i could continue on a limited basis on selected servers but needed to locate a more permanent solution of interest perhaps is that i found your script listed along with several others on microsofts expression discussion forum naturally i investigated all of the listed scripts along with several others that i located independently and none of them come close to the huggins email form script  the customizations available to developers are absolutely superior  the documentation with the script is not only complete and comprehensive but also well written  the personal support that you provide when questions do arise is prompt specific and very helpful in short this is an absolutely superior package i am proud to be a client and happy to provide the reference to others thank you again for your hard work dr lynn eubank toulouse school of graduate studies university of north texas nov  nb this testimonial comes from bob walto who discovered a problem and communicated it to me thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this and for resolving it so quickly i was pretty darn sure that it was an error on my part but it was a very pleasant experience to review this error with you and determine the error was in the script you have done an excellent job of delivering a very useful script and your commitment to delivering quality is very much evident in the service you provide bob walto wwwwaltocom nov  hi james i  now have all three of my web site forms converted to your email script the other two were easy for me to do after getting the first one up and running i am a happy camper attached is a formal thank you i sincerely thank you your script is exactly what i needed and what thousands of other frontpage users are looking for no doubt the fact that i do not write code and could actually get your script up and running on my web site says a lot about your script it is truly wonderful your documentation and online example and form tutorial made it all understandable here are the links for my three forms wwwdixonpubliclibraryorgillrequesthtml  wwwdixonpubliclibraryorgillarticlerequesthtml and you already saw wwwdixonpubliclibraryorgaskalibrarianhtml  our library usually receives requests from  of the  forms every day i am the interlibrary loan librarian and i am happy to say that i rarely get requests via the article request form since this is not the type of stuff our patrons are usually looking for  but its there for people that might need it and is used occasionally but the other two forms get lots of use thanks again betty beatty oct  i appreciate everything you have done to help me to get a form ready vietta helmle wwwbeagletechcom aug  hi jim i successfully implemented your php email form script on several of my web sites and it works great i use  web hosting and they suddenly

you tell me where to send the check thanks edgar sewall webmaster itedgarcom arlington ma  aug  hi james i implemented your pseudocaptcha on a website who was getting  spamsday via contact us form now it is zero thanks doug deprenger  smartlab software llc wwwsmartlabsoftwarecom jul  when i received word from our host that they were phasing out support of frontpage extensions i switched to expression web i tried ews form wizard but as rumored i too found it to be lacking so i began looking for a third party form script we have  frontpagecreated webs with various types of mail forms tutorial feedback surveys registration forms and questionnaires i tried the tectite email form but discovered that they guide one to a paying subscription by not answering questions on their forum once they have you hooked then i tried james script and what a difference the over all experience has been what i appreciate most beside the fact that it caters to scriptcoding semiilliterates like myself its virtually copypaste is that i have the experience that james is committed to service i marvel at his immediate implementations of edit suggestions it makes me feel like im part of his

hosts my sites it is fantastic and the manual is wellwritten and very helpful i just completed implementing your script on a site and will definitely be using it on others except for the one on

writing to say how much i appreciate your email form script when i decided to set up a site for my husband i had no idea what html code was thought that css and seo might be acronyms for certain illnesses and fell in to despair when i realized that i would need to put an email form on the contact page in short i was a complete and total novice i do not know what i would have done without your script it is simple to use but when my lack of experience led me to make stupid mistakes you very patiently helped me to understand what i needed to do to install the form i have been very happy with the form and very very grateful for your support you have truly helped us to set up a site that works my husband is an artist and in a few short months the form has been the bearer of commissions two exhibitions in london and portugal and virtually no spam at all i would have no hesitation in recommending your script to anyone no matter what their level of experience or expertise if i can install and use it anyone can thank you again for your kindness in providing the script and for your thorough and patient support lorraine davison wwwpauldavisonfr feb mr huggins  things are going very well with the script you provided so well that the scoutmaster will not accept any other communications for a conference that does not come through this form thanks again thomas j casey boy scout troop  wwwtrooporg jan i found you on google thanks a bunch i have been trying to get someone help me set up a form for  weeks with your script and manual i did it in one evening thanks philip matthews nov mr huggins i have been looking for a program or script that would handle the forms i put on my web sites and i have tried quite a few with some limited success but mostly problems causing wasted time energy and money your huggins email form script is simply the best script i have found my only problem is that i did not find it in  or  when i first started doing my site of course microsofts front page with their extensions would handle some of what your script does but i have tried to move away from that monopoly and do the coding myself the only reason i used front page was the fact that they could handle a rather simple form now that i have found your script i am completely free to do as i want and your program puts very little limitations on what i can only dream about incorporating in any of my forms thank you so much for this script it really is the answer i have been looking for  years or so jim p bryan allendale sc usa before nov for several reasons i resolved to move away from requiring the frontpage server extensions on my site one of the things that had been locking me to the fpse however was the inability to find a reasonably secure and easytouse replacement for the email form handler hefs proved to be the solution to my needs and while i still use frontpage to manage my site i have managed to eliminate any need for the fpse and can now use reputable hosting services that i had to disregard previously because of the lack of fpse support thanks for this jeff zeitlin editor freelance traveller the electronic fansupported travellerž resource wwwfreelancetravellercom before nov dear james i am using your email form scripton every one of my sites and a site i manage for a commercial furniture stores i use the script for both a contact form on all sites and as a family group sheet on my genealogy site i even use it on one of my sites that does not support php by referring to the script on another of my sites the script works just as advertised and you have provided great documentation and tech support it also works well to use it as an include to insert where needed and i can tell exactly which page the form came from i appreciate the fact that you continue to work to improve the form and quickly fix any bugs that are found i do not hesitate to recommend your email form scriptto anyone who needs to provide forms on their site thanks you for all you do for us pat geary wwwgenealogywebcreationscom before nov james i just wanted to let you know how much i appreciate you and your program i had been posting in several forums my issue with getting a form mail program to work you stepped forward and offered yours for free but better than that you were willing to handhold me thru the whole process of getting it installed set up and working you took hours to help me talking with my hosting tech support to try to resolve problems and going the extra mile to help me you have been there after normal business hours to work with me to get my clients a reliable way of processing the forms they need for their websites i can not thank you enoughwords are not enough i will sing your praises and point people to you at every opportunity my sincere thanks debi carpadus founder senior designer bright hope designs  bright hope mine rd  kelsey ca  office cell   fax  wwwbrighthopedesignscom before nov read the documentation yesterday and find it very easy to implement besides hiding the email address i especially like the ability to send the email to more than one address this could allow me to send to an alternate gmail account  where i can automatically archive all the messages thanks troth wwworiginalgeekstercom before nov imho it is a great script and i know it is going to resolve some major issues with our online adoption application l harral wwwmalinoisrescueorg before nov i never expected a free email program to come with personalized help from the programmer but thats exactly what i got our dog rescue group works with allvolunteer help and james came through for us when we changed servers and needed a new email program to power our adoption application he even took the time to ask what modifications to the code and documentation would be useful to us he may be a windows guru but he lives with the spirit of open source thank you so much james catherine de la cruz webmistress great pyrenees rescue of northern california inc wwwgprncorg before nov the huggins email form scripthas been a lifesaver for me i use it in a number of areas on my site to send email notifications and collect information it is so easy to use  the documentation is impeccably written and easy to follow kudos james alicia staz wwwbeadedroyaltycom before nov i have been looking for a form in php to move from frontpage forms something ive put off for far too long when i heard about james form i was really happy not only does it work as advertised knowing james i knew that any bug would be instantly looked at that he would strive to improve it and not only that make it do things normally one would have to pay thousands for ive recommended james form to many others and use it on all new sites and will change over each of my sites as i get time i cannot recommend his form highly enough i can only hope that james continues with this enterprise for a long time to come i intend to encourage him all the way tina clarke microsoft mvp  frontpage anyexpressioncom before nov i started to write my own php email submittal form but found yours after finding out about your excellent
