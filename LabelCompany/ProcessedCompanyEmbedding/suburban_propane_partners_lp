suburban propanes top line is falling but dont run for the hills its not as bad as it looks reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer apr   at am image source subruban propane partners suburban propane partners lp nyse sph sports a huge  or so distribution yield yields at that level are often a sign that investors think a company is a risky investment add in the fact that suburbans top line has fallen year over year in each of the past six quarters and you can understand why investors might be worried but dont freak out  thats the worst mistake you could make right now propane its not as risky as investors think when it comes to fuel propane is mostly an afterthought you probably think of a backyard cookout when you hear the word propane and while thats appropriate the fuel is also used to power small vehicles in warehouses dry crops and heat homes in hardtoreach locations low cost and portability are key selling points recently propane prices have been low thats a good thing because cheap propane acts as a deterrent to customer switching a longerterm problem for the industry ill discuss in a second but because propane is what suburban sells low prices have had a negative impact on the top line in a big way for example revenues declined  in  however suburban is really just a middle man it gets paid to deliver propane basically passing propane costs through to its customers so the topline decline isnt as big a deal as it may at first seem proving this out is that fact that ebitda in  declined only  or so much less than revenues another interesting aspect of the propane industry is growth i noted that propane is being displaced honest ill talk about that soon which suggests that suburban and its peers should be shrinking but they arent and acquisitions are the reason why for example ferrellgas partners nyse fgp has consummated over  deals since  for its part suburban basically doubled its size when it bought inergys propane business in  catapulting it into the top echelon of the propane industry  although theres always risk involved in mergers these companies are pros at buying both large and small competitors and that provides an avenue for growth that you might miss if you dont understand the propane industry  sph dividend yield ttm data by ycharts but there are things to worry about just the sameperhaps the biggest longterm issue facing propane is displacement see im a man of my word propane is most useful because it can be easily transported but technology advances are offering alternatives like fuel cellpowered lifts that can replace propane in warehouses and natural gas pipeline expansions and electric heating are providing competitive options for keeping homes toasty  so the longterm trend for propane in the united states has been and will likely continue to be slow decline thats why acquisitions are so important they not only provide growth but they help to offset volume declines from customer switching but youll still want to keep an eye on attrition if you intend to own a propane company  the bigger issue over short periods of time for suburban and its competitors however is the weather the past couple of winters have been warm ones and thats reduced volumes sold so unlike oil companies where price is the key problem weather is the bigger issue to watch in propane although weather is out of the partnerships control and a few warm winters arent the end of the world in fact suburban has been doing the right things to deal with the issue such as cutting costs in its fiscal first quarter the company trimmed expenses by roughly  suburban has also been working hard to keep its finances strong thats important if youre top and bottom lines are weak for example it acquired a propane business in the quarter without having to tap its bank lines running the partnership and growing it with cash on hand it still has nearly  million of cash in the bank and roughly  million worth of capacity on its bank lines to keep growing its business but in an acquisition driven business youll want to watch the balance sheet closely just in case it isnt a problem now however that doesnt mean it cant turn into one that said if suburban is feeling the pinch of warm weather then smaller peers are probably hurting just as bad if not worse that means the opportunity for more acquisitions and solid finances suggest that suburban is in a good position to take advantage of the situation even the tough environment could turn into a net benefit so long as suburban doesnt get greedy and try to do too much deal making at one time theres risk but understand itso the worst thing suburban propane partners unitholders could do right now is get overly concerned about falling commodity prices cheap propane is actually good for the partnership even though it hampers the top line the next big mistake would be to get overly concerned about the weather  thats hurting volumes but it also provides more opportunity for financially solid suburban to acquire the businesses it needs to keep growing there are clearly risks here but the right thing to do is to understand them and put them into the proper
