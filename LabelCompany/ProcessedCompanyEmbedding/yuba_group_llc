received a us patent for a guitar amplifier that is lightweight and affordable yet has the sound of traditional tubetype amplifiersjason sannar product design manager for gibbs group llc of yuba city was granted his first patent which protects the design of the em guitar amplifier made by four force the em won best of show at the national association of music merchants trade show in nashville tenn in july last year competing against heavyweights like peavey marshall and fender sannar  a gridley high school graduate who lives in live oak won approval for the design patent which covers the way it physically looks jim mcgillivary an executive with tektronix designed the amps circuit technology mcgillivarys utility patent for the way the amplifier operates is pending when jim came to us all he had was the circuit board and he asked us to design something different than the typical amp sannar recounted last week i looked at literally thousands of amp designs and what you could see was that theyre all a box so i knew i needed to do something other than thatwe knew we had to make this look different from other amps there are thousands of them on the market and we knew it had to look different or no one would give it a second thought and no one would hear what it sounds like he explained the em utilizes a solidstate circuit board unlike traditional amps which use vacuum tubes it weighs only  pounds relieving guitar players from having to lug around large heavy tubeamplifiers they still use tubes today because musicians like the sound tube amps have a very distinct sound sannar said but theyre expensive theyre delicate the tubes can break the problem with solid state is it doesnt have the same warm sound as a tube amp so jim came up with a new type of solidstate circuitry to mimic the sound of a tube amplifier with tubelike distortion which guitar players want fender even tried to do it and fell short through gibbs groups china branch a manufacturer in china was found for production of the em the factory also makes speakers for vox and fender four force llc which is owned by mcgillivary was set up to make and distribute the em the amp went on the market

forcing the issue dateline july   the struggle to find a solidstate amp that matches a tube amp has been raging from the day solidstate was invented the technology was cheaper lighter and in many ways more versatile which all seemed like advantages to the early adopters it didnt take long for amp designers to start scrambling to replicate the natural breakup and warm tones of classic tubes though the new californiabased company four force recently unveiled what could be the next step in this quest an ultracompact amp called the em its a sleek pound solution to a decadesold problem and the company says its just getting started the small em is initially the sole focus and identity of four force its a watt combo amp with a watt  speaker and a band eq overdrive and volume controls that can also power an extension cabinet for bigtime volumes the amps work on a circuit technology dubbed tube illusion that was developed by founder jim mcgillivary an executive at a tech company the group began showing off the amps at the  winter namm show and immediately started getting great response indeed at the namm show they took to wearing the amps around their neck to demonstrate how lightweight they were rankin says the weight never gets in the way of a need for volume i took it home and hooked it up to a marshall  cabinet which is a w cabinet and it was shaking the walls youd be surprised with this little w amp pushing a  ohm cabinet it will take you by surprise the  speaker is great for practice but you can turn that up if youre using it in more of a live band setting you can hook it up to an extension cabinet two s two s four s even a full stack it will push them contact gibbs group combines an american design team with international manufacturing alliances and is

dougproductbuilderscom or gibbsgroupllc skype or wwwproductbuilderscom yc man has green plan for styrofoam dateline october   doug gibbs challenges anyone to tear his business card in half the strongest resident could try but its doubtful they would shred it in two the normallooking card is made from recycled plastic and is just one product gibbs hopes to soon see manufactured in the yubasutter area when the new business greenfreak gets off the ground by starting the plastic foam recycling company he and others at gibbs group aim to put local residents back to work and help the environment the business model is fairly simple divert expanded polystyrene commonly known as styrofoam from the landfill then recycle it into a highervalue product and train local residents how to manufacture sell and market those new plastic products im not trying to save the world he said but i see so many people with no jobs and their lives are falling apart and this is what i can do last week gibbs presented the business to supervisors in yuba and sutter counties and the yuba city economic development commission hoping to gain their endorsement greenfreak can begin manufacturing plastic products in as little as two months as soon as it signs a contractual agreement for expanded polystyrene with a waste management agency recology has first right of refusal but several other landfill agencies are also waiting in the wings gibbs said polystyrene is a problem everywhere in the country gibbs said if it can be reclaimed and processed into a higher value commodity known as upcycling there is a profit to be made along with positive environmental benefits a giant block of expanded foam that once cushioned and protected electronics is processed down to a small amount of pelletized resin which can be made into any plastic object whether skateboards bobbleheads or medical equipment gibbs said greenfreak already has developed prototypes of possible products and has buyers lined up he said he plans to use existing business relationships with walmart williamssonoma and ace hardware and offer to make any recycled plastic product they desire this is building jobs which is no  on our list of things we need to accomplish said councilwoman leslie mcbride because it is green its not being trucked off polluting and clogging our roadways to go  miles to los angeles and then be trucked back here styrofoam is an ongoing challenge he said it has no recycling home at this point and ultimately ends up in the landfill the expanded polystyrene presents more of a volume issue than a weight issue but also doesnt produce any methane for the landfill to capture and convert to energy it is a product that doesnt really break down or biodegrade it just takes up space he said its of no value to the landfill as greenfreak grows so will the number of jobs profits for the waste management company and the lifespan of the landfill gibbs said the waste management agency that partners with the company will receive a percentage of the profits the plan is to start with premiergrade expanded polystyrene the kind that is most often found cushioning electronics and other breakables once the business is established it may eventually broach the market for secondgrade polystyrene containers such as chinese takeout and convenience store coffee cups contact gibbs group
