holdings plc acquired mercantile the s brought another separation of the original firm when oppenheimer capitals senior personnel acquired a majority interest in the subsidiary and separated from opco in  robert and gantcher who controlled about  percent of opcos equity became eager to locate additional capital to grow their firm at first opco explored options of forming a possible alliance with

from the secondlargest private german financial institution and retail bank bayerische vereinsbank on thursday may   the wall street journal announced that pittsburghbased pnc bank corp was in talks to buy oppenheimer  co for about  million in cash stock and options the articles source warned that pnc and oppenheimer hadnt arrived at a fixed price and that chatter could break the formal agreement which was two weeks or more away analysts speculated that pnc would be paying too much for a brokerage house that no longer carried the brand recognition it once did in the securities industry only  days following the announcement the bloomberg news desk announced that for the third time in two years opco had been abandoned by a prospective buyer two months later it was announced that cibc wanted

having been closed the firms name was changed to cibc oppenheimer holdings cibc wood gundy continued to act as the operating name in canada yet all european and asian subsidiaries took the cibc oppenheimer name in  cibc made the decision to sell oppenheimer’s retail brokerage business and name for  million to fahnestock viner holdings which subsequently changed its name to oppenheimer this

fahnestock viner holdings would eventually change its name in  upon the acquisition of cibc oppenheimers retail brokerage business the private client and us asset management divisions upon this acquisition the new oppenheimer  co would attempt to build an institutional division brandishing the once infamous oppenheimer moniker after several unsuccessful tries oppenheimer  co in late

domestic investment banking equities leveraged finance and related debt capital markets businesses the transaction also included cibcs israeli investment banking and equities business and certain parts of other us capital marketsrelated businesses located in the uk and asia the formal agreement dictated that oppenheimer would borrow  million from cibc in the form of a subordinated debt as well as a warehouse facility provided by the canadian bank the warehousing facility initially up to  billion would allow the newly formed oppenheimer us entity to finance and hold the syndicated loans for us middle market companies underwriting of loans pursuant to the warehouse facility would be subject to joint credit approval by oppenheimer and cibc in doing so cibc would benefit from the future success of oppenheimer  co some speculated that this sale was the result of the  settlement of the civil lawsuits related to cibcs entanglement with enron for about  billion it was one of the largest such settlements to date and believed to adversely affect cibc operations for many cibc world markets employees who remained from the original oppenheimer  co the sale was reunification of sorts the
