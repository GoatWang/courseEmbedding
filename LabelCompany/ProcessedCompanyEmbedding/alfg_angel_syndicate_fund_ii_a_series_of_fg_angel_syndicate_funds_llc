make sense in the situations i was involved in it would have immediately solved the specific problem so that’s good but ever since we started working with angellist on fg angels we’ve been wrestling with something called we’ve been referring to as the  investor problem we structure our investment in companies via an llc that has all the individual fg angels syndicate members in it this simplifies life for the company as they only end up with  investor – the fg angels syndicate lcc – rather than a bunch of individual investors at this point we have  backers in our syndicate so with us each company would end up having  separate investors if we didn’t use the llc if everyone was on the cap table the company would have to chase down  signatures for everything instead using our approach they have effectively two investors – our fg angels syndicate one investor and foundry group another investor two signatures much easier we handle the foundry group signature angellist handles the syndicate signature except it doesn’t work that way the sec limits an llc to having  investors so we can only have  of the  syndicate members participate now there’s a nuance that excludes “qualified purchasers” qps – individuals with m in assets and firms with m in assets – from the  investor count overall our qps  the top  investors in our syndicate represent  based on committed amounts to fg angels if you include the balance of the  members we end up at a syndicate of  the company then gets our commitment of  on top of that as a result of this  investor limitation we have two disappointing problems first we have over  investors who would like to invest in our syndicate with us who get excluded because of the  investor rule next there is  per investment that we’d like to include in each syndicate that the companies we are investing in won’t get bad for the companies and bad for the investor we’ve spent lots of time over the past  days trying to solve the  investor problem at this point we’ve run into a dead end we’ve tried multiple llcs – that doesn’t work as they end up getting viewed as a single entity we’ve tried other structures – that doesn’t work we’re certainly open to ideas at this point in the mean time until we solve this angellist is making the following changes to their syndicates product – qualified purchasers angellist will include all qualified purchasers individuals with m in assets and firms with m in assets in each syndicated deal as they are exempt from the sec’s investor limit we will soon email your backers to determine if they are qualified purchasers qps and we will update your syndicate management interface to indicate the qps – top  backers the next time you syndicate a deal we will include all qps and the top  nonqps by commitment amount you can override this default to include specific backers who are not in the top  the top  backers will change dynamically as backers adjust their backing amounts – funds we are working on new funds products to allow additional investors who are not in your top  backers or qps to participate in your syndicated deals – notifying backers finally we will notify your backers of the sec’s investor restriction this week and give them the opportunity to change their backing amounts we are bummed about this because part of our goal is to build a very large angel network as a result of the fg angels activity the  investor rule directly undermines this and limits the amount of investment and support for the companies we are investing in it’s another example of the challenges of the jobs act and another discovery on our part of the “miss” between the goal of the new law and the implementation sean killeen disclaimer i know next to nothing about these aspects of business and am purely spitballing so apologies if this is unworkable a thought instead of splitting up the investors into groups could you split up what they’re investing in into groups if you have  investors could you create three entities for them to invest in that are all controlled by the syndicate which would allow  per trying to turn the problem on its head to see if it makes more sense to shuffle things around on the flip side jasonmendelson the sec is too smart for that and will consider them as one entity sigh… david brooks very interesting i would assume this will lead to a small number of very large syndicates hopefully angellist creates enough transparency among smaller investors so that they know where they stack up in a syndicate and have flexibility to move to others with less backing but will investors do that or is the idea of a superstar lead too compelling jasonmendelson trying to post again… i agree with your take large syndicates will need to have higher investing followers no idea what investors will do but it’s a serious bummer that we can’t truly have crowdfunding here jlm  potential solution investors form gp or lp with unlimited number of investors and with conditions determined by investors en masse this effectively mirrors the angellist syndicate rules you are effectively moving the angellist rules upstream gp or lp forms llc with a single managing member and the gp or lp as other member llc — with single managing member and gp or lp member — joins angellist as investment vehicle new llc makes investments and complies with all secjobs act and angellist rules variation on theme each investment uses a mirror image but “one off” llc in order not to commingle different investments this would also be a bit of legal insurance against spill over legal liability jlm  millie tadewaldt good ideas the issue here is that the sec is too smart for that 🙂 and it “looks through” all investment vehicles that are formed specifically for the purpose of buying the same portfolio company counting all of the individual investors in those special purpose vehicles against the investor limit it is possible for form a more “fundlike” investment vehicle that deploys capital across multiple deals without triggering the lookthrough davej have you looked into setting it up as a mutual fund jasonmendelson we haven’t because as mutual fund managers we’d be liable to all of the syndicate members if we chose bad investors our investors in the our main venture funds would not allow this and we are generally scared of lawyers which is why i stopped looking in mirrors long ago joe wallin davej–cost of being a mutual fund is prohibitive so it is not a practical solution brett topche it’s an issue for small traditional funds as well depending on which sec exemption you use to raise your fund you are typically limited to  lps not an issue for larger funds with fewer larger institutional commitments but for smaller funds raised primarily from high net worth individuals it can be a pain in the ass also from the company standpoint if the llc is formed solely for the purpose of investing in that company ie your syndicate forms a new llc for each investment which seems likely given that the syndicate changes over time all of the investors in the llc count towards their  limit not necessarily a huge deal for one syndicate investing in a company but if you have a couple of syndicates involved even though you only have to chase down one signature you can start eating into your  jasonmendelson agreed tubbybartles this issue is more difficult than other angellist issues elsewhere angellist is meeting the spirit of the law but needed to find a clever way to meet the letter of the law as well given the new technologies in this case the spirit of the  investor rule is to prevent large number of investors from acting as a coordinated group without “being public” so the sec has had many many years to plug every possible letterofthelaw loophole the specific legal language doesn’t refer to funds – it refers to “organized groups” and the sec considers that to mean they look through any legal structure you pick to see whether the group is organized as a single group or not splitting investments into parallel funds or by groups of “upstream” funds as suggested in the comments here is already said by the sec to count all investors i suspect this one may need a law change to address jasonmendelson i agree the integration issues that sec makes part of the issue kills us perhaps a noaction letter is due sean schantzen have you found a way that a no action letter could help with this the limit comes from the investment company act and is in the statute itself which i don’t think a no action letter could change i don’t know anyway around it without running into integration issues maybe a creative no action letter that addresses just integration since integration isn’t in the statute but the sec would really have to be on board with syndicates we’ve been trying to find a work around for this too but came to the same conclusions if someone goes down the no action letter road we’d be happy to be involved and help out jasonmendelson i haven’t found a way it’s just a theory if the sec won’t bust us we are clean but this is a very broad topic that a no action letter might not work for sean schantzen thanks the whole  investor limit seems like a relic just like the  investor reporting limit it would be great to at least increase it by the same x the  investor limit was regardless of whether by no action letter or statute change jasonmendelson agreed dl jlm outlined the direction sproutrhouse is looking for a solution brad where has this path led you since angel list began offering syndicates i have been working to solve a variation of this problem to serve earlystage companies privately at sproutrhouse sproutrhouse offers natural cpg brands a simple crowd funding solution but it’s a k investment that the market is seeking and one sproutrhouse is wellsuited to address jasonmendelson we’ve actually only been led to the ideas that brad describes above i have a feeling we are headed toward a request for a sec noaction letter but the issue might be too broad and need legislative action carlos does a series llc work not available in cali but who wants to do business there anyway 😉 stackexchange i am exploring using a series llc in a novel way to promote investment into a core technology where each individual “app” of this core technology could be its own company separates investors liability minimizes paperwork and above all fees right would this be something you guys would entertain in funding in my case hoping that this could be useful in this case as well this afterall was given birth via the mutual fund industry per wikipedia httpsenwikipediaorgwikiseriesllc jasonmendelson well unfortunately we need to be able to do business in ca so no and if you make the company split up like that you get pass through taxes to the investors which doesn’t work either thanks for the idea jmn if section c is not amended the  investor limit could severally undermine the jobs act’s on several levels the accredited investor verification requirements as defined by the jobs act should be sufficient foundation to argue a  investor cap – in line with the max number of ai’s a private company can introduce as shareholders a noaction letter may work if the sec’s fully aware its efforts surrounding the jobs act could be vein bfeld yup it feels like one possible solution is a noaction letter but this ultimately is a oneoff per organization eg angellist so it doesn’t really solve the overall problem jmn although a oneoff result the outcome would set a precedent assisting other organizations startups small investors the other option is a collective effort to force an amendment to section c if common sense prevailed the upside benefits far outweigh the downside risk if the investor cap was increased in line with allowable shareholders letting companies decide the weighting subject to ai’s being certified pursuant to title ii riverland could this be relevant or helpful httpsverifyinvestorcom bfeld sort of angellist is doing this for free however – see httpswwwfeldcomarchivesangellistaccreditationreporthtml jor law hi cofounder of verifyinvestorcom and angellist fan here what we do is similar to what angellist provides but they have a limited use case while ours is a more reliable and comprehensive solution their solution is great for their platform i think but ours is something that can be relied upon by companies their advisorsprofessionals and investors who need certainty of compliance jor law somehow my other post got removed but i did want to add that httpsverifyinvestorcom doesn’t currently address the investment company act and  invest limit issue it’s more a solution relating to general solicitation and c objectmethodologycom sounds like we need an “ownership act” something that let’s people in the us a country based on freedom be free to do as they please scott welcome to my world brad the company act and the investor slot issues are a real pain in the ass as you’ve discovered if you structure your vehicles as c vehicles by including only qps you’ll be ok it’s actually pretty easy if you must accommodate accredited investors look into registered investment company “ric” structures a closed end ric essentially a ’ act closedend mutual fund structure allows you to aggregate accredited investor capital in a private vehicle it’s not a free lunch – you’ll need to be registered have an independent board have thirdparty admin etc on the plus side its fairly permanent capital liquidity with gating is flexible and offers the ability to reinvest proceeds or dividend out proceeds and is well traveled ground you should look into it there is a cost but if the money you’re aggregating is big enough it could make sense bfeld yup – we know this well – and have no interest in going down this path that’s not – in our mind – the goals of the jobs act nor is it how we approach our world in general which is why a we’ve never done this sort of thing in the past and b we are intrigued and excited about the ground angellist is plowing felix dashevsky this issue arises because you are double pooling investors given the electroniceasy nature of angellist closing process i question the need for a separate syndicate llc let the investors invest directly into startups and play with startup funding docs to ensure streamlined future interaction with investors or use power of attorney advisory contract or solve it technologically the issue such direct structure would highlight is your and angellist’s fee however i think you can structure around it optionswarrants at opco investment advisory contract something else creative if it is an advisory contract you’ll run into investment advisory act and “qualified client” issues… but frankly i am not sure how you or angellist have avoided these so far bfeld if i was on the startup side i wouldn’t want this regardless of the legal docs there will be at least one situation where you have to chase down signatures and that could be the nightmare we’ve focused very hard on the legal dynamics around iaa and are very comfortable but really understanding it has been nontrivial felix dashevsky but isn’t that what the jobs act was about like the  limit you alluded to in the opening paragraph “a lot of fanfare around … the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have” or the crowdfunding bits it wasn’t about broader access to fundlike structures but to startups if startups want just a couple of big investors… well we don’t need the jobs act at all if we step back nothing we are discussing was in fact affected by the jobs act–fg angels is using the “old” b pathway bfeld since we are using b you are correct which means that the jobs acts is not accomplishing the goal felix dashevsky which was what felix dashevsky my point is that neither the jobs act nor any other rule on startup fundraising is causing any issue here the “problem” is not endemic to startup investing like the “problem” is bfeld i guess i just disagree if you’ve been following what we’ve tried to do with fg angel it’s very much about democratizing startup investing and the  investor rule is a huge disconnect from the jobs act goals especially in raising the private investor cap from  to  felix dashevsky fair enough i am following fg angel by backing it although not sure if i will make it into the  the next time jmn brad i concur with your position the question is what can be done to resolve this hurdle there’s always a solution jason best and team at crowdfund capital advisors httpscrowdfundcapitaladvisorscomaboutusourteamjasonbesthtml may be a starting point jmn it appears my previous comment was removed because a link to a third party’s website was included a private company found on the net that was involved with pushing the jobs act legislation through my point was there’s sure to be a solution to this problem but it’s going to take some digging and talking to the right people who can push for change at the legislative level otherwise the “ investor problem” is here to stay there’s no way around it eddie wharton could you have a  person bradfg angels llc another  person jasonfg angels llc etc instead of combining them off the cap table just include  different llc’s it would be a bit more work is not a scalable solution past a certain point and relies enormously on the trust that you have built to make sure all of the fg angel llc make the exact same investments with the same terms this is not an effective solution for everybody and one part of the law seems to undermine the spirit of another big picture that needs to be fixed however this could be a way to keep fg angels growing and still have a low single digit number of additions to the cap table jasonmendelson i wish sec would look into “who is brad  jason” and realize we are partners and then game over they integrate and we are “done” joe wallin i think we ought to just repeal the investment company act… steve consilvio stop investing and give your money away i love it how rich prigs think they are helping others by lending them money and then sucking the blood out of a new business you guys should be ashamed of yourselves fred destin my personal view is that we do this one step at a time and prove we are responsible actors on a functional platform the  investor problem could also refer to  when retail investors were left holding cats in bags prepared for them by professional investors let’s build a strong platform with good diligence tools social signals evidence of track record and then go back and propose the next regulatory evolution i am convinced there is a day where crowdfunding will apply to startups as it applies to products on kickstarter but we need to make sure it’s done well let’s celebrate the deregulation demonstrate our platform works and then fight for the next step bfeld fair enough however when the  shareholder limit was raised to  i don’t think anyone was paying attention to the  llc rule if there was thoughtful discussion about it that’s cool but my instinct is that there wasn’t and that’s what’s frustrating  disappointing to me i think the gang at angellist was just as surprised by this based on all of our work together since you are investors directly in angellist realizing that their initial view was there was no problem having larger syndicates is probably important as part of understanding how this all evolves as we planned from the beginning the fg angels experiment is just that – an experiment – so we are happy to find all the limitations edge cases and problems i don’t think our behavior or performance is – or should be – a proxy for regulators as we are merely one data point so i’m happy to be public about all the challenges we run into steven kane hi brad re the chasing signatures issue couldnt the startup simply require angels who invest directly to submit to some kind of “drag along” right meaning once the angel’s money is invested no signatures are ever required ever again bfeld possibly it’s one of the approaches we’ve looked at we – and some of the companies we’ve talked to – aren’t comfortable with it since it still ends up with a huge number of individual investors on the cap table lunarmobiscuit the investment act and sec seems to have thought through every straightforward workaround given that it seems the best path is to go back and questions the assumptions you set up this llc to a simplify the paperwork for the investees b centralize the decision making of the syndicate c prove out the angellist crowdfunding model of these only a is limited by the rules i saw in the comments that the rules don’t allow you to run one llc and any of your foundry partners to run a second llc but what stops any of the other  people in the syndicate from setting up a second llc a “notfg angels llc” whose manager receives no communications from you but who watches angellist to see what fg angels invests in and follows along you pick  others to be part of fg angels and someone from the other  others not picked can choose  more for notfg angels llc and so on with trulynotfg angels until you hit the  investor limit which i believe really has no workaround bfeld that’s a valid hack and certainly open to anyone who wants to do it rxdxt this is richard titus founder of promptly foundry syndicate investment  chiming in… i agree this is a real problem promptly was super excited about the opportunity  the democratic innovation in investment – but we were surprised the final investment amount was so much lower than commitments it all worked out as we were significantly oversubscribed via direct investment perhaps syndicates could “back each other up” ie each syndicate could act as a “submanager” to investors who are interested in a deal but cannot fit into the st  investors of the original syndicator i’d be happy to serve in this capacity for foundry it should be noted we and i hope you don’t mind we did this “picked off” some of the obviously qp investors and invited them to invest directly to allow more people into the deal – but until the sec  irs solve this that seemed the best way to preserve access – to our view the purpose of angellist is to level the playing field for investors – particularly smaller ones and diversify the investment landscape based on my fantastic experience as an entrepreneur being backed by foundry  it’s syndicate – i’ve started my own thanks again bfeld we’re glad you picked off additional qp investors to invest directly all good… henry glover what if the  members pooled together to form a firm with m in assets making one “qualified purchaser” might be silly for one deal but if you had a lot of people in a “firm” it basically makes the firm a really large syndicate im guessing it would require either bigger checks more people  a lot of deals for it to scale… vc firm bfeld that won’t work as the entity will have   investors scott kosch brad i’m in your syndicate and make the  cutoff because of my perdeal amount but i also qualify as a qp just got around to getting a letter from a financial institution to attest to this but in the online form it also mentions that they might periodically run my credit history i don’t like the idea of having my credit run frequently like possibly for every deal or even a few times per year because this negatively impacts credit scores which i think is crazy can you say anything about this i hate to fill an accredited spot when i could be included as a qp but the periodic credit check gave me pause bfeld i don’t know the answer to this specifically but will check scott kosch brad thanks for asking al about this here is what i learned so that others don’t shy away from validating their qp status the credit check they perform is called a “soft pull” add your own joke to that it does not impact your credit score unlike a “hard pull” nevertheless if you still want to avoid this repeated credit check for each deal there are two ways al may not need to check as frequently first if you invest through an entity which is whollyowned by one or more qps then that entity is a qp and they shouldn’t need to run your credit personally second if you can verify that your net worth is greater than m and not just your net assets ie your net worth would be less debt and other liabilities then credit checks aren’t necessary anyway happy that i can make room for one more investor by changing my status tejdhawan that’s an interesting observation you’re correct that the credit score would likely by hit by the credit check the credit report would generally affirm the salary based qualification requirements but not the remaining  or  as financial assets nonprofit work institutional mgmt etc don’t make it into credit checks the criminalbankruptcy items that do make it into credit checks would apply to the companies raising the funding through fg angelssyndicate interesting question to send to al directly as well and this is making me think that the company raising the funds should also be providing representations that they clear the ‘bad actor disqualification’ test twitter facebook linkedin google angellist  where the world meets startups join   log
