universe of midcap companies encompasses approximately  publicly traded companies traded on the us stock exchanges with market capitalizations between  billion and  billion we look for companies andor industries where there is positive fundamental change taking place but where this change has not yet been recognized by the broader investment community a researchdriven process seeking longterm value creation at the industry level we focus on industries in transition outoffavor or outofcycle sectors where we can identify an inflection point leading to improving supplydemand and pricing fundamentals or to consolidation within the industry at the company level the firm looks for changes that will lead to improving and more sustainable profitability such as a change in the management a restructuring of the business or a new proprietary product or service while positive change is the prerequisite element to identifying a potential investment candidate there must also be a value

technological innovation or  an improving supplydemand structure companyspecific value creators may include  a transforming acquisition  the sale or divestiture of an underperforming business or  introduction of a new set of products solutions or services the underlying rationale behind the search for value creators is to avoid value traps defined as undervalued businesses with no path toward recognition of such value the guiding principle behind our investment philosophy is to address the risk of an investment first then the return potential in this phase of our process our goal is to identify and quantify where possible those risks that would be unacceptable and thus would preclude our purchase of a company as well as those that are within acceptable levels we endeavor to apply consistently a researchdriven investment process in an effort to separate unacceptable risks from acceptable uncertainties and to estimate intrinsic value of an enterprise the process is fundamental
