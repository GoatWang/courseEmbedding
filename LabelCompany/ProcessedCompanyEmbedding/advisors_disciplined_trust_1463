assurance the trust will achieve its objective principal investment strategy the trust seeks to provide high current income with capital appreciation as a secondary objective even if inflation andor interest rates in general rise the portfolio seeks to achieve this objective by investing in five different themes that wef believe will be able to provide the potential for stable income and price appreciation in an inflationary environment these five themes are  dividendpaying equities  real estate investment trusts reits  master limited partnerships mlps  closedend investment companies known as closedend funds and referred to herein as the funds that have elected to be treated as business development companies under the investment company act of  bdcs and  taxable closedend funds we sought to focus on entities selected based on numerous factors including current valuation price to earnings price to sales and premiumdiscount current dividend levels historic dividend levels historic dividend growth rates payout ratios revenue and earnings growth trends balance sheet strength and past performance in selecting the funds for the bdc and taxable closedend fund themes we examined current holdings and selected funds based on these factors approximately  of the portfolio consists of funds classified as non diversified under the investment company act of  these funds have the ability to invest more than  of their assets in securities of a single issuer which could reduce diversification principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these  security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time  an issuer may be unable to make income andor principal payments or declare dividends in the future this may reduce the level of income the trust receives which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall  the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period  the value of certain securities will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future  the trust invests in shares of closedend funds closedend funds tend to trade at a discount from their net asset value and are subject to risks related to factors such as the managers ability to achieve a funds objective market conditions affecting a funds investments and use of leverage the trust and the underlying funds have management and operating expenses you will bear not only your share of the trusts expenses but also the expenses of the underlying funds by investing in funds the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds  the trust invests in shares of bdcs in particular bdcs are generally leveraged which may magnify the potential for gains and losses on amounts invested which increases the risks associated with those securities bdcs generally depend on the ability to access capital markets raise cash acquire suitable investments and monitor and administer those investments in order to maintain their status as bdcs and achieve their investment objectives a failure to do so may adversely affect the value of the bdc shares and the value of your units bdcs often invest in securities that are not publicly traded which adversely impacts their ability to value those assets and reduces the investments liquidity  f aam we and related terms mean advisors asset management inc the trust sponsor unless the context clearly suggests otherwise  investment summary pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  the trust invests in shares of reits a reit is a company dedicated to owning and in some cases operating incomeproducing real

and certain funds held by the trust invest in mlps mlps are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are generally taxed as partnerships with interests traded on securities exchanges most mlps generally operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sector and are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in those sectors mlps are also subject to the risk that authorities could challenge the tax treatment of mlps for federal income tax purposes which could have a negative impact on the aftertax income available for distribution by the mlps andor the value of the trusts investments  the trust andor the underlying funds may invest significantly in stocks of small and midsize companies these stocks are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than stocks of larger companies small and midsize companies may have limited products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information  the funds may invest in unrated securities or securities rated below investment grade and are considered to be junk securities these securities are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks accordingly the risk of default is higher than investment grade securities in addition these securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal  securities of foreign issuers held by the underlying funds in the trust present risks beyond those of us issuers these risks may include market and political factors related to the issuers foreign market international trade conditions the global and countryspecific political environment less regulation smaller or less liquid markets increased volatility differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies  we do not actively manage the portfolio while the closedend funds have managed portfolios except in limited circumstances the trust will hold

and equals  of the public offering price per unit based on a  public offering price per unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on the trusts inception date the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee as a result the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price per unit varies the transactional sales fee does not include the creation and development fee which is described under expenses the maximum sales fee equals  of the

purchase the minimum amount you can purchase of the trust appears on page  under essential information but such amounts may vary depending on your selling firm reducing your sales fee we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the fee you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units except as expressly provided herein you may not

whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences we may discontinue this option at any time upon sixty days notice distributions monthly distributions your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income prorated on an annual basis along with any excess capital on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year because it is structured as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change the closedend funds in the trusts portfolio generally make dividend payments on a monthly basis different funds pay dividends at different times during a month when the trust receives dividends from a fund the trustee credits the dividends to the trusts accounts in an effort to make relatively regular income distributions the trusts monthly income distribution is equal to onetwelfth of the estimated net annual dividends to be received by the trust after deduction of trust operating expenses because the trust does not necessarily receive dividends from the underlying funds at a constant rate throughout the year the trusts income distributions to unitholders may be more or less than the amount credited to the trust accounts as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuation in income distributions the trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide income distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee will be reimbursed without interest for any such advances from available income received by the trust on the ensuing record date estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the dividends the trust will receive from the closedend funds by annualizing the most recent dividends declared by the closedend funds we generally base the estimate of the understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th income the trust may receive from operating companies by annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income payments however dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual dividends received by the trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in dividends received and with the sale of securities the estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs creation and development fee and the deferred sales fee reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your

before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund credit risk is the risk that a borrower is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on a security held by a closedend fund this may reduce the level of dividends a closedend fund pays which would reduce your income and could cause the value of your units to fall dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds held by a closedend fund will fall if interest rates increase the securities held by the closed end funds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th rates fall the securities held by the closedend funds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes closedend funds all of the bdcs are closedend funds closedend funds are a type of investment company that holds an actively managed portfolio of securities closedend funds issue shares in closedend offerings which generally trade on a stock exchange although some closedend fund shares are not listed on a securities exchange in addition closedend funds dont have to manage fund liquidity to meet potentially large redemptions closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors only the trustee may vote the shares of the closedend funds held in the trust the trustee will vote the shares in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders of each fund your trust is generally required however to reject any offer for securities or other property in exchange for portfolio securities as described under how the trust works changing your portfolio bdcs bdcs are closedend investment companies that have elected to be treated as business development companies under the investment company act of  bdcs are required to hold at least  of their investments in eligible assets which include among other things i securities of eligible portfolio companies generally domestic companies that are not investment companies and that cannot have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or have securities that are marginable that are purchased from that company in a private transaction ii securities received by the bdc in connection with its ownership of securities of eligible portfolio companies or iii cash cash items government securities or high quality debt securities maturing one year or less from the time of investment bdcs ability to grow and their overall financial condition is impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital in addition to raising capital through the issuance of common stock bdcs may engage in borrowing this may involve using revolving credit facilities the securitization of loans through separate whollyowned subsidiaries and issuing of debt and preferred securities bdcs are less restricted than other closedend funds as to the amount of debt they can have outstanding generally a bdc may not issue any class of senior security representing an indebtedness unless immediately after such issuance or sale it will have asset coverage of at least  thus for example if a bdc has  million in assets it can borrow up to  million which would result in assets of  million and debt of  million these borrowings also known as leverage magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and accordingly the risks associated with investing in bdc securities while the value of a bdcs assets increases leveraging would cause the net value per share of bdc common understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th stock to increase more sharply than it would have had such bdc not leveraged however if the value of a bdcs assets decreases leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had such bdc not leveraged in addition to decreasing the value of a bdcs common stock it could also adversely impact a bdcs ability to make dividend payments a bdcs credit rating may change over time which could adversely affect their ability to obtain additional credit andor increase the cost of such borrowing agreements governing bdcs credit facilities and related funding and service agreements may contain various covenants that limit the bdcs discretion in operating its business along with other limitations any defaults may restrict the bdcs ability to manage assets securing related assets which may adversely impact the bdcs liquidity and operations bdcs compete with other bdcs along with a large number of investment funds investment banks and other sources of financing to make their investments competitors may have lower costs or access to funding sources that cause bdcs to lose prospective investments if they do not match competitors pricing terms and structure as a result of this competition there is no assurance that a bdc will be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment opportunities or that they will fully be able to invest available capital bdc investments are frequently not publicly traded and as a result there is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments bdcs may use independent valuation firms to value their investments and such valuations may be uncertain be based on estimates andor differ materially from that which would have been used if a ready market for those investments existed the value of a bdc could be adversely affected if its determinations regarding the fair value of investments was materially higher than the value realized upon sale of such investments due to the relative illiquidity of certain bdc investments if a bdc is required to liquidate all or a portion of its portfolio quickly it may realize significantly less than the value at which such investments are recorded further restrictions may exist on the ability to liquidate certain assets to the extent that subsidiaries or related parties have material non public information regarding such assets bdcs may enter into hedging transaction and utilize derivative instruments such as forward contracts options and swaps unanticipated movements and improper correlation of hedging instruments may prevent a bdc from hedging against exposure to risk of loss bdcs are required to make available significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies significant managerial assistance refers to any arrangement whereby a bdc provides significant guidance and counsel concerning the management operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company examples of such activities include arranging financing managing relationships with financing sources recruiting management personnel and evaluating acquisition and divestiture opportunities bdcs are frequently externally managed by an investment adviser which may also provide this external managerial assistance to portfolio companies such investment advisers liability may be limited under their investment advisory agreement which may lead such investment adviser to act in a riskier manner than it would were it investing for its own account such investment advisers may be entitled to incentive compensation which may cause such adviser to make more speculative and riskier investments than it would if investing for its own account such compensation may be due  understanding your investment

employees and board members any issuance of derivative securities requires the approval of the companys board of directors and authorization by the companys shareholders a bdc may operate a profitsharing plan for its employees subject to certain restrictions bdcs frequently have high expenses which may include but are not limited to the payment of management fees administration expenses taxes interest payable on debt governmental charges independent director fees and expenses valuation expenses and fees payable to third parties relating to or associated with making investments the trust will indirectly bear these expenses and estimated bdc expenses are shown in the trusts annual operating expenses under fees and expenses to illustrate the impact of their impact these expenses may fluctuate significantly over time if a bdc fails to maintain its status as a bdc it may be regulated as a closedend fund which would subject such bdc to additional regulatory restrictions and significantly decrease its operating flexibility in addition such failure could trigger an event of default under certain outstanding indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on its business real estate investment trusts the trust may invest significantly in reits many factors can have an adverse impact on the performance of a particular reit including its cash available for distribution the credit quality of a particular reit or the real estate industry generally the success of reits depends on various factors including the occupancy and rent levels appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents on those properties economic recession overbuilding tax law changes higher interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact reits their future earnings and share prices risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include among other factors  general us and global as well as local economic conditions  decline in real estate values  the financial health of tenants  overbuilding and increased competition for tenants  oversupply of properties for sale  changing demographics  changes in interest rates tax rates and other operating expenses  changes in government regulations  faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements  regulatory and judicial requirements including relating to liability for environmental hazards  changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand and  the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at rates acceptable to developers variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and reits in particular properties understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th owned by a reit may not be adequately insured against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental liabilities including remediation costs the value of real estate investments may also be affected by the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market in the united states subprime loans have higher defaults and losses than prime loans subprime loans also have higher serious delinquency rates than prime loans the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market may have farreaching consequences into many aspects and geographic regions of the real estate business and consequently the value of the portfolio may decline in response to such developments you should also be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects the real estate industry may be cyclical and if a fund acquires reit securities at or near the top of the cycle there is increased risk of a decline in value of the reit securities recent demand for certain types of real estate may have inflated the value of real estate this may increase the risk of a substantial decline in the value of such real estate and increase the risk of a decline in the value of the securities reits are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the markets perception of the reit industry generally because of their structure and a current legal requirement that they distribute at least  of their taxable income to shareholders annually reits require frequent amounts of new funding through both borrowing money and issuing stock thus reits historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new equity shares or equivalents to purchase or build new properties this may have adversely affected reit equity share market prices both existing and new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future especially if reits continue to issue stock when real estate prices are relatively high and stock prices are relatively low the value of reits may also be affected by the downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets in response government authorities have initiated and may continue to engage in administrative and legislative action intended to address both short and longterm difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets and the broader economy no one can predict the action that might be taken or the effect any action or inaction will have and it is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the state of these difficulties as intended the downturn and corresponding government action may have far reaching consequences into many geographic regions and consequently the value of securities in the portfolio may decline in response to such developments mlps mlps are limited partnership or limited liability companies that are generally taxed as partnership whose interests are generally traded on securities exchanges an mlp consists of a general partner and limited partners the general partner manages the partnership has an ownership stake in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive

trusts investments preferred securities certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in preferred securities including preferred stocks trust preferred securities or other similar securities preferred stocks are unique securities that combine some of the characteristics of both common stocks and bonds preferred stocks generally pay a fixed rate of return and are sold on the basis of current yield like bonds however because they are equity securities preferred stocks provide equity ownership of a company and the income is paid in the form of dividends preferred stocks typically have a yield advantage over common stocks as well as comparablyrated fixed income investments preferred stocks are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments trust preferred securities are limitedlife preferred securities typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures or similarly structured securities distribution payments of the trust preferred securities generally coincide with interest payments on the underlying obligations trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks but unlike preferred stocks in some cases distributions are treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes and therefore are not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction trust preferred securities prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perception of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the market for trust preferred securities or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur trust preferred securities are also sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase in a rising interest rate environment and the risk that a trust preferred security may be called for redemption in a falling interest rate environment trust preferred securities are also subject to unique risks which include the fact that dividend payments will only be paid if interest payments on the underlying obligations are made which interest payments are dependent on the financial condition of the issuer and may be deferred for up to  consecutive quarters during any deferral period investors are generally taxed as if they had received current income in such a case an investor will have income taxes due prior to receiving cash distributions to pay such taxes in addition the underlying obligations and thus the trust preferred securities may be prepaid after a stated call date or as a result of certain tax or regulatory events preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments small and midsize companies the trust invests significantly in stocks issued by small and midsize companies the share prices of these companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors common to many such issuers including limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information foreign issuer risk underlying securities held by certain of the closedend funds in the trust may be issued by foreign issuers this subjects understanding your investment  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st the trust to more risks than if it only invested in closedend funds which invest solely in securities of domestic issuers risks of foreign issuers include restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities and inadequate financial information foreign securities may also be affected by market and political factors specific to the issuers country as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller less developed less liquid less regulated and more volatile than the securities markets of the us and developed foreign markets investments in debt securities of foreign governments present special risks including the fact that issuers may be unable or unwilling to repay principal andor interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt or may be unable to make such repayments when due in the currency required under the terms of the debt political economic and social events also may have a greater impact on the price of debt securities issued by foreign governments than on the price of us securities in addition brokerage and other transaction costs on foreign securities exchanges are often higher than in the united states and there is generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in foreign countries legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities

register units for sale in various states in the us we do not register units for sale in any foreign country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units the amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities into the trust is shown in the notes to portfolio taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into three categories ordinary income distributions capital gains dividends and return of capital ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  percent medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself the trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust securities  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th when you redeem units or when your trust terminates this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes investments in certain foreign corporations if the trust holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders the trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes the trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal understanding your

dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to  distributions from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interestrelated dividend attributable to certain

disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each security if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees the trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the trust portfolio each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide high current income with capital appreciation as a secondary objective the trust invests in a portfolio consisting of the themes described in the prospectus there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objectives the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in special circumstances as provided in the trust agreement thus the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged under normal circumstances the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may sell securities designated by the supervisor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses in addition if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company including the requirements with respect to diversification under section  of the  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th internal revenue code and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment company proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the replacement securities must be equity securities of the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter

the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the cash attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would

securities closedend funds issue shares of common stock that are generally traded on a securities exchange although some closedend fund shares are not listed on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors certain of the closedend funds included in the trust may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks these risks may include the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises risk factors market risk because the trust invests in securities you should understand the risks of investing in securities before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the securities and therefore units will fall securities are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of securities often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the securities in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell securities in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some trusts hold a relatively small number of securities you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of

services companies in particular the downturn has also led to considerable writedowns in the values of many assets held by financial services companies and a tightening of credit markets that has been marked by a general unwillingness of many entities to extend credit these factors have caused a significant need for many financial services companies to raise capital to meet obligations and to satisfy regulatory and contractual capital requirements many wellestablished financial services companies have been forced to seek additional capital through issuances of new preferred or common equity and certain companies have been forced to agree to be acquired by other companies or sell some or all of their assets to other companies in some cases government assistance guarantees or direct participation in investments or acquisitions have been necessary to facilitate these transactions in addition concerns regarding these issues and their potential negative impact to the us and global economies have resulted in extreme volatility in securities prices and uncertain market conditions in response to these issues government authorities in the us and other countries have initiated and

existing banks into branches consolidation may continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and

securities received by the bdc in connection with its ownership of securities of eligible portfolio companies or iii cash cash items government securities or high quality debt securities maturing one year or less from the time of investment bdcs ability to grow and their overall financial condition is impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital in addition to raising capital through the issuance of common stock bdcs may engage in borrowing this may involve using revolving credit facilities the securitization of loans through separate whollyowned subsidiaries and issuing of debt and preferred securities bdcs are less restricted than other closedend funds as to the amount of debt they can have outstanding generally a bdc may not issue any class of senior security representing an indebtedness unless immediately after such issuance or sale it will have asset coverage of at least  thus for example if a bdc has  million in assets it can borrow up to  million which would result in assets of  million and debt of  million these borrowings also known as leverage magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and accordingly the risks associated with investing in bdc securities while the value of a bdcs assets increases leveraging would cause the net value per share of bdc common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had such bdc not leveraged however if the value of a bdcs assets decreases leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th otherwise would have had such bdc not

various covenants that limit the bdcs discretion in operating its business along with other limitations any defaults may restrict the bdcs ability to manage assets securing related assets which may adversely impact the bdcs liquidity and operations bdcs compete with other bdcs along with a large number of investment funds investment banks and other sources of financing to make their investments competitors may have lower costs or access to funding sources that cause bdcs to lose prospective investments if they do not match competitors pricing terms and structure as a result of this competition there is no assurance that a bdc will be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment opportunities or that they will fully be able to invest available capital bdc investments are frequently not publicly traded and as a result there is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments bdcs may use independent valuation firms to value their investments and such valuations may be uncertain be based on estimates andor differ materially from that which would have been used if a ready market for those investments existed the value of a bdc could be adversely affected if its determinations regarding the fair value of investments was materially higher than the value realized upon sale of such investments due to the relative illiquidity of certain bdc investments if a bdc is required to liquidate all or a portion of its portfolio quickly it may realize significantly less than the value at which such investments are recorded further restrictions may exist on the ability to liquidate certain assets to the extent that subsidiaries or related parties have material non public information regarding such assets bdcs may enter into hedging transaction and utilize derivative instruments such as forward contracts options and swaps unanticipated movements and improper correlation of hedging instruments may prevent a bdc from hedging against exposure to risk of loss bdcs are required to make available significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies significant managerial assistance refers to any arrangement whereby a bdc provides significant guidance and counsel concerning the management operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company examples of such activities include arranging financing managing relationships with financing sources recruiting management personnel and evaluating acquisition and divestiture opportunities bdcs are frequently externally managed by an investment adviser which may also provide this external managerial assistance to portfolio companies such investment advisers liability may be limited under their investment advisory agreement which may lead such investment adviser to act in a riskier manner than it would were it investing for its own account such investment advisers may be entitled to incentive compensation which may cause such adviser

fees and expenses valuation expenses and fees payable to third parties relating to or associated with making investments these expenses may fluctuate significantly over time if a bdc fails to maintain

closedend funds in the trust invest in various securities as such an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks of investing in both closedend fund shares and such securities closedend funds portfolios are managed and their shares are generally listed on a securities exchange the net asset value of closedend fund shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of the underlying securities that the closedend fund owns in addition for various reasons closedend fund shares frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors closedend funds articles of incorporation may contain certain antitakeover provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a funds possible conversion to openend status and limiting the ability of other persons to acquire control of a fund in certain circumstances these provisions might also inhibit the ability of stockholders including the trust to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices this characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that a funds net asset value will decrease in particular this characteristic would increase the loss or reduce the return on the sale of those closedend fund shares that were purchased by the trust at a premium in the unlikely event that a closedend fund converts to openend status at a time when its shares are trading at a premium there would be an immediate loss in value to the trust since shares of openend funds trade at net asset value certain closed end funds may have in place or may put in place in the future plans pursuant to which the fund may repurchase its own shares in the marketplace typically these plans are put in place in an attempt by a funds board of directors to reduce a discount on its share price to the extent that such a plan is implemented and shares owned by the trust are repurchased by a fund the trusts position in that fund will be reduced and the cash will be distributed the trust is prohibited from subscribing to a rights offering for shares of any of the closedend funds in which it invests in the event of a rights offering for additional shares of a fund unitholders should expect that the trust will at the completion of the offer own a smaller proportional interest in such fund that would otherwise be the case it is not possible to  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th determine the extent of this dilution in share ownership without knowing what proportion of the shares in a rights offering will be subscribed this may be particularly serious when the subscription price per share for the offer is less than the funds net asset value per share assuming that all rights are exercised and there is no change in the net asset value per share the aggregate net asset value of each shareholders shares of common stock should decrease as a result of the offer if a funds subscription price per share is below that funds net asset value per share at the expiration of the offer shareholders would experience an immediate

unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at rates acceptable to developers variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and reits in particular properties owned by a reit may not be adequately insured against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental liabilities including remediation costs you should also be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects the real estate industry may be cyclical and if the trust acquires reit securities at or near the top of the cycle there is increased risk of a decline in value of the reit securities and therefore the value of the units reits are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the markets perception of the reit industry generally because of their structure and the legal requirement that they distribute at least  of their taxable income to shareholders annually reits require frequent amounts of new funding through both borrowing money and issuing stock thus reits historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new equity shares or equivalents to purchase or build new properties this may have adversely affected reit equity share market prices both existing and new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future especially when reits continue to issue stock when real estate prices are relatively high and stock prices are relatively low  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th

the effect any action or inaction will have and it is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the state of these difficulties as intended the downturn and corresponding government action may have far reaching consequences into many geographic regions and consequently the value of securities in the portfolio may decline in response to such developments foreign issuers since certain or all of the trusts portfolio securities or the underlying securities held by certain of the closedend funds trust are issued by foreign companies an investment in the trust involves certain investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment in a trust which invests entirely in the securities of domestic issuers these investment risks include future political or governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities the possibility that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities may become impaired or that the general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen both of which would contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the securities and thus in the value of the units the limited liquidity and relatively small market capitalization of the relevant securities market expropriation or confiscatory taxation economic uncertainties and foreign currency devaluations and fluctuations in addition for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  there may be less publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer in addition foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers the securities of many foreign issuers are less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers in addition fixed brokerage commissions and other transaction costs in foreign securities markets are generally higher than in the united states and there is generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in foreign countries than there is in the united states however due to the nature of the issuers of the securities in the closedend funds selected for the trust the sponsor believes that adequate information will be available to allow the supervisor to provide portfolio surveillance for the trust securities issued by nonus issuers generally pay income in foreign currencies and principally trade in foreign currencies therefore there is a risk that the us dollar value of these securities will vary with fluctuations in the us dollar foreign exchange rates for the various securities there can be no assurance that exchange control regulations might not be adopted in the future which might adversely affect payment to the closedend funds or the trust the adoption of exchange control regulations and other legal restrictions could have an adverse impact on the marketability of international securities in the trust and on the ability of the trust to satisfy its obligation to redeem units tendered to the trustee for redemption in addition restrictions on the settlement of transactions on either the purchase or sale side or both could cause delays or  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th increase the costs associated with the purchase and sale of the foreign securities and correspondingly could affect the price of the units investors should be aware that it may not be possible to buy all securities at the same time because of the unavailability of any security and restrictions applicable to the trust relating to the purchase of a security by reason of the federal securities laws or otherwise foreign securities generally have not been registered under the securities act of  and may not be exempt from the registration requirements of such act sales of nonexempt securities by a closedend fund in the united states securities markets are subject to severe restrictions and may not be practicable accordingly sales of these securities by a closedend fund will generally be effected only in foreign securities markets investors should realize that the securities in the closedend funds might be traded in foreign countries where the securities markets are not as developed or efficient and may not be as liquid as those in the united states the value of the securities will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent highyield securities an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks that an investment in highyield highrisk debt obligations or junk obligations may entail including increased credit risks and the risk that the value of the units will decline and may decline precipitously with increases in interest rates in recent years there have been wide fluctuations in interest rates and thus in the value of debt obligations generally certain of the securities included in the funds in the trust may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income and principal than are investments in loweryielding higherrated securities and their value may decline precipitously because of increases in interest rates not only because the increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy and a decrease in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the credit of issuers of highyield highrisk securities resulting in a higher incidence of defaults among highyield highrisk securities a slowdown in the economy or a development adversely affecting an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the rate and at the prices respectively that are required to produce sufficient cash flow to meet its interest and principal requirements for an issuer that has outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated highyield high risk securities an increase in interest rates will increase that issuers interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating however many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt this reduces exposure to increasing rates but reduces the benefit to the issuer of declining rates the sponsor cannot predict future economic policies or their consequences or therefore the course or extent of any similar market fluctuations in the future highyield or junk securities the generic names for securities rated below bbb by standard  poors or below baa by moodys are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development by established companies whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged companies purchased in leveraged buyout transactions the market for highyield securities is very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly financial institutions highyield securities are generally not listed on a national securities  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th exchange trading of high yield securities therefore takes place primarily in overthecounter markets that consist of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms because the highyield security market is a dealer market rather than an auction market no single obtainable price for a given security prevails at any given time prices are determined by negotiation between traders the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made not all dealers maintain markets in all high yield securities therefore since there are fewer traders in these securities than there are in investment grade securities the bidoffer spread is usually greater for highyield securities than it is for investment grade securities the price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions and the value of the trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent if the rate of redemptions is great the value of the trust may decline to a level that requires liquidation lowerrated securities tend to offer higher yields than higherrated securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers of lowerrated securities may not be as strong as that of other issuers moreover if a security is recharacterized as equity by the internal revenue service for federal income tax purposes the issuers interest deduction with respect to the security will be disallowed and this disallowance may adversely affect the issuers credit rating because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with the lowerrated securities in the funds in the trust the yields and prices of these securities tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities with changes in the perceived quality of the credit of their issuers in addition the market value of highyield highrisk securities may fluctuate more than the market value of higherrated securities since these securities tend to reflect shortterm credit development to a greater extent than higherrated securities lowerrated securities generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than higherrated securities issuers of lowerrated securities may possess fewer creditworthiness characteristics than issuers of higherrated securities and especially in the case of issuers whose obligations or credit standing have been downgraded may be subject to claims by debtholders owners of property leased to the issuer or others which if sustained would make it more difficult for the issuers to meet their payment obligations highyield highrisk securities are also affected by variables such as interest rates inflation rates and real growth in the economy therefore investors should consider carefully the relative risks associated with investment in securities that carry lower ratings the value of the shares of the closedend funds reflects the value of the portfolio securities including the value if any of securities in default should the issuer of any security default in the payment of principal or interest the closedend funds in the trust may incur additional expenses seeking payment on the defaulted security because amounts if any recovered by the funds in payment under the defaulted security may not be reflected in the value of the fund shares until actually received by the funds and depending upon when a unitholder purchases or sells his or her units it is possible that a unitholder would bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any portion of the payment recovered  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st highyield highrisk securities are generally subordinated obligations the payment of principal and premium if any interest and sinking fund requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the issuer senior obligations generally include most if not all significant debt obligations of an issuer whether existing at the time of issuance of subordinated debt or created thereafter upon any distribution of the assets of an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution total or partial liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any payment moreover generally no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior indebtedness thus in the event of insolvency holders of senior indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more ratably than holders of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer obligations that are rated lower than bbb by standard  poors or baa by moodys respectively should be considered speculative as such ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade investors should carefully review the objective of the trust and consider their ability to assume the risks involved before making an investment in the trust convertible securities risks the closedend funds held by a trust may invest in convertible securities convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible fixedincome securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however a convertible securitys market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company particularly when the stock price is greater than the convertible securitys conversion price the conversion price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock as the market price of the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price the price of the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security than by the market price of the underlying common stock thus it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock and convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks however mandatory convertible securities as discussed below generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities would be paid before that companys common stockholders consequently an issuers convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock however convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations in addition contingent payment convertible securities allow the issuer to claim deductions based on its nonconvertible cost of debt which generally will result in deduction in excess of the actual cash payments made on the securities and accordingly holders will recognize income in amounts in excess of the cash payments received mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion price at maturity is based solely upon  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd the market price of the underlying common stock which may be significantly less than par or the price above or below par paid for these reasons the risks associated with investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common stocks mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss upon conversion because the market price of a mandatory convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion date there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the potential loss senior loans the closedend funds held by a trust may invest in senior loans issued by banks other financial institutions and other investors to corporations partnerships limited liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts recapitalizations mergers acquisitions stock repurchases debt refinancings and to a lesser extent for general operating and other purposes senior loans in which the closedend funds invest  generally are of below investment grade credit quality  may be unrated at the time of investment  generally are not registered with the sec or any state securities commission and  generally are not listed on any securities exchange an investment by closedend funds in senior loans involves risk that the borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans are typically structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on closedend funds investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment the amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be less extensive than that available for other types of assets no reliable active trading market currently exists for many senior loans although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past several years senior loans are thus relatively illiquid liquidity relates to the ability of a closedend fund to sell an investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the closedend funds books the illiquidity of senior loans may impair a closedend funds ability to realized the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets because of the lack of an active trading market illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities however many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of financial institutions to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans the market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the market for senior loans could be disrupted in the  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest rates this could result in increased volatility in the market and in the trusts net asset value if legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions the availability of senior loans for investment by the closedend funds may be adversely affected in addition such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers this would increase the risk of default if legislation or federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans such sales could result in depressed prices if a closedend fund attempts to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale the price a closedend fund could get for the senior loan may be adversely affected some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws could subordinate the senior loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other action detrimental to lenders such court action could under certain circumstances include invalidation of senior loans any lender which could include a closedend fund is subject to the risk that a court could find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws of tort or contracts or antifraud provisions of certain securities laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral underlying the senior loan preferred stock risks the closedend funds held by a trust may invest in preferred stocks preferred stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction market liquidity and global or regional political economic or banking crises preferred stocks are also vulnerable to congressional reductions in the dividendsreceived deduction which would adversely affect the aftertax return to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction such a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general holders of preferred stocks as owners of the entity have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or in some cases other senior preferred stocks of such issuers preferred stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities the issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy the value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding and thus the value of the securities may be expected to fluctuate over the life of the trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the trusts inception date  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th trust preferred securities risks the closedend funds held by a trust may invest in various preferred securities holders of trust preferred securities incur risks in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding preferred stocks trust preferred securities are limitedlife preferred securities that are typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation or similarly structured securities the maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures trust preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances at any time trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks but unlike preferred stocks distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes unlike most preferred stocks distributions received from trust preferred securities are generally not eligible for the dividends received deduction certain of the risks unique to trust preferred securities include i distributions on trust preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures are made ii a corporation issuing the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these instruments for up to  consecutive quarters and if such election is made distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the deferral period iii certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date iv future legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes making redemption of these instruments likely v a corporation may redeem the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a stated call date vi trust preferred securities holders have very limited voting rights and vii payment of interest on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities is dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation real estate investment trusts many factors can have an adverse impact on the performance of a particular real estate investment trust reit including its cash available for distribution the credit quality of a particular reit or the real estate industry generally the success of reits depends on various factors including the occupancy and rent levels appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents on those properties economic recession overbuilding tax law changes higher interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact reits their future earnings and share prices risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include among other factors  general us and global as well as local economic conditions  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  decline in real estate values  the financial health of tenants  overbuilding and increased competition for tenants  oversupply of properties for sale  changing demographics  changes in interest rates tax rates and other operating expenses  changes in government regulations  changes in zoning laws  the ability of the owner to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance  faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements  the cost of complying with the americans with disabilities act  regulatory and judicial requirements including relating to liability for environmental hazards  natural or manmade disasters  changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand and  the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at rates acceptable to developers variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and reits in particular properties owned by a reit may not be adequately insured against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental liabilities including remediation costs the value of real estate investments may also be affected by the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market in the united states subprime loans have higher defaults and losses than prime loans subprime loans also have higher serious delinquency rates than prime loans the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market may have farreaching consequences into many aspects and geographic regions of the real estate business and consequently the value of the portfolio may decline in response to such developments you should also be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects the real estate industry may be cyclical and if the trust acquires reit  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th securities at or near the top of the cycle there is increased risk of a decline in value of the reit securities and therefore the value of the units reits are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the markets perception of the reit industry generally because of their structure and the legal requirement that they distribute at least  of their taxable income to shareholders annually reits require frequent amounts of new funding through both borrowing money and issuing stock thus reits historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new equity shares or equivalents to purchase or build new properties this may have adversely affected reit equity share market prices both existing and new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future especially when reits continue to issue stock when real estate prices are relatively high and stock prices are relatively low the value of reits may also be affected by the downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets in response government authorities have initiated and may continue to engage in administrative and legislative action intended to address both short and longterm difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets and the broader economy no one can predict the action that might be taken or the effect any action or inaction will have and it is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the state of these difficulties as intended the downturn and corresponding government action may have far reaching consequences into many geographic regions and consequently the value of securities in the portfolio may decline in response to such developments discount securities certain of the securities held by the closedend funds in the trust may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the funds were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market discount of previously issued securities will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline the market discount of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount securities will be reduced market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the securities premium securities certain of the securities held by the closedend funds in the trust may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium securities at the time they were purchased by the fund were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable securities decrease the market premium of previously issued securities will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th comparable securities increase the market premium of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of securities trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable securities of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium security at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed securities have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units in connection with these deposits existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs administration of the trust distributions to unitholders income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account for the trust all other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate capital account for the trust the trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata share of the estimated net annual income distributions to be received by the trust all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the

least  per unit the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the unitholders pro rata share of the estimated annual income distributions to be received by the trust after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business the selling brokerdealer provides such notice the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the capital account of a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be
