which are described in more detail in the statutory prospectus general risk the fund may not achieve its investment objective an investment in the fund could decline in value and you could lose money by investing in the fund company risk the price of the stock of a particular company can vary based on a variety of factors such as the companys financial performance changes in management and product trends and the potential for takeover and acquisition the prices of equity securities of smaller companies may fluctuate more than for more established companies the equity securities of smaller companies may not be traded as often as for larger companies therefore it may be difficult to trade securities at a desirable price investments in companies with small market capitalizations generally offer greater opportunities for appreciation but are associated with more risks than for established companies market risk the risk that prices of securities will go down because of the interplay of market forces may affect a single issuer industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market as a whole large cap risk larger more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges and also may not be able to attain the high growth rate of successful smaller companies mortgage risk the duration of mortgagerelated securities and interest rates tend to move together as interest rates rise the duration of mortgagerelated securities extends referred to as extension risk and as interest rates fall mortgagerelated securities are often prepaid at a faster rate referred to as prepayment risk because of interest rate changes it is not possible to predict the realized yield or average life of a mortgagebacked security mortgagebacked securities issued by private corporations generally have more credit risk than securities issued by us government agencies stock risk the value of your investment will go up or down depending on movements in the stock markets the investment results may be better or worse than the results for the stock markets taken as a whole or than the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities it may be more difficult for the fund to sell a small capitalization stock or any stock that trades overthecounter than a larger capitalization stock or stocks that trade on a national or regional stock exchange fixed income risk the value of your investment will go up or down depending on movements in the bond markets investment management risk the funds investment results may differ from the results of a comparable bond market and from the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities or particular debt securities interest rate risk fixed income securities have an inverse relationship to interest rates such that as interest rates rise bond values decrease and the fund faces a heightened level of interest rate risk under current conditions because interest rates are at historically low levels corporate debt risk during periods of economic uncertainty the value of corporate debt securities may decline relative to the value of us government debt securities debt obligations are subject to the risk that issuers may not be able to pay off the principal and interest when due credit risk debt obligations are generally subject to the risk that the issuer may be unable to make principal and interest payments when they are due call risk when interest rates decline an issuer may have an option to call the securities before maturity resulting in reduced income noninvestment grade debt risk noninvestment grade debt obligations known as junk bonds have a higher risk of default and tend to be less liquid than higherrated securities liquidity risk the prices of debt securities may be subject to significant volatility particularly as markets become less liquid due to limited dealer inventory of corporate bondsmoney market instrument risk money market instruments may decline in value based on the performance of the issuer or changes in prevailing interest rates the returns on money market instruments can be adversely affected when yields on

investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservationoriented the funds allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors education savings goals will be met the target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether

company if an affiliated person of that investment adviser or principal underwriter is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and rules etbi and ii under the  act provide exemption from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to those affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying management company  applicants state that the relief provided by rules ebii and etbii permits the life insurance company to serve as the underlying funds investment adviser or principal underwriter provided that none of the insurers personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section a participates in the management or administration of the fund this partial relief from the requirements of section  serves to limit the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of that section applicants state that rules eb and etb recognize that the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act do not require application of section a to individuals in a large insurance company complex most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies within such a complex these rules further recognize that it is unnecessary to apply section a to individuals in unaffiliated insurance companies or their affiliated companies that may utilize an investment company as the funding medium for variable contracts in applicants view no regulatory purpose is served by extending section a monitoring requirements in the context of extended mixed or shared funding the participating insurance companies and qualified plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the investment companies the individuals who manage the investment companies will remain the same regardless of which separate accounts or qualified plans invest in the investment companies applicants further submit that the costs of such extended monitoring may result in increased costs for participating insurance companies and qualified plans and may thereby adversely affect contract owners and plan participants  rules ebiii and etbiii provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirements with respect to several significant matters rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that an insurance company may disregard contract owners voting instructions which would change the subclassification or investment objectives of an underlying fund or any contract between such a fund and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of rules e and et rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that an insurance company may disregard contract owners voting instructions which would initiate any change in an underlying funds investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii biib and biic of rules e and et  with respect to qualified plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to passthrough voting rights to plan participants indeed applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with plan assets to certain specified persons under section a of erisa mutual fund shares sold to a qualified plan must be held by the trustees of the plan section a also provides that plan trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the plan except a when the plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the plan and not contrary to erisa and b when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of plan assets is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of these two exceptions applies plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies  when a named fiduciary to a qualified plan appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held by the plan unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary qualified plans may have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the qualified plans in their discretion some qualified plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from plan participants  applicants state even if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in an openend management investment company applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such company to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities in an underlying fund in this regard applicants submit the investment in an underlying fund by a plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding unlike mixed funding or shared funding plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  applicants state that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulatory body could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its policies the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem  applicants further state that shared funding by unaffiliated insurers in this respect is no different that the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers which rules eb and etb permit affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and subject to differing state law requirements in applicants view affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements applicants submit that the conditions set forth in the application and included in this notice are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences start printed page among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulatorys decision conflicts with the position of a majority of other state regulators then the affected insurer will be required to withdraw its separate accounts investment in the investment companies this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreements  rules eb and etb give the insurance company the right to disregard the contract owners voting instructions in certain specific circumstances this right does not raise any issues different from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts applicants submit that affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et that the insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific goodfaith determinations  applicants state that a particular insurers disregard of voting instructions could nevertheless conflict with the majority of contract owners voting instructions and with the determinations of all or some other insurers including affiliated insurers that contract owners voting instructions should prevail it could either preclude a majority vote approving a change or represent a minority view if the insurers judgment represented a minority position or precluded a majority vote then the insurer might be required at the relevant investment companys election to withdraw its separate accounts investment from the affected portfolio no charge or penalty would be imposed as a result of such withdrawal this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreements  applicants submit that there is no reason why the investment policies of an underlying fund would or should be materially different depending on whether such underlying fund funds only variable annuity contracts or only variable life insurance policies whether flexible premium or scheduled premium policies each type of insurance product is designed as a longterm investment program applicants represent that each of the funds and the portfolios of future investment companies will be managed to attempt to achieve its investment objective or objectives and not to favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance product  applicants state that no one investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular insurance product each pool of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status age and insurance and investment goals an underlying fund supporting even one type of insurance product must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers permitting mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of contract owners which will facilitate the establishment of additional funds serving diverse goals  as noted above section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable contracts held in an underlying mutual fund the code provides that a variable contract shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance as applicable for any period and any subsequent period for which the investments are not in accordance with regulations adequately diversified  regulations issued under section h provide that in order to meet the statutory diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies the regulations however contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which allows shares in an underlying mutual fund to be held by the trustees of a qualified plan without adversely affecting the ability of such shares also to be held by separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts treas reg fiii the regulations thus specifically permit “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to invest in the same underlying fund for this reason applicants have concluded that the code regulations and revenue rulings thereunder do not present any inherent conflicts of interest  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from variable contracts and qualified plans are taxed these differences will have no impact on the investment companies if at the time distributions are to be made a separate account or qualified plan is unable to net purchase payments against distributions each will redeem shares of the relevant underlying funds at their respective net asset values in conformity with rule c under the  act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds for distribution needs a participating insurance company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of its variable contract and a qualified plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the plan  applicants considered whether and determined that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to contract owners in separate accounts and if necessary or desirable to qualified plans in connection with any meeting of shareholders the investment companies will inform each separate account and qualified plan of its respective shares of ownership in the funds or the portfolios of future investment companies each participating insurance company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with rules e and et as applicable and its obligations under participation agreements with the investment companies qualified plans and separate accounts will each have the opportunity to exercise voting rights with respect to their shares in the funds or the portfolios of future investment companies although only the separate accounts are required to passthrough their votes to contract owners the voting rights provided to a qualified plan with respect to shares of the funds or portfolios of future investment companies would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public furthermore if a material irreconcilable conflict arose because a qualified plan decided to disregard plan participants voting instructions if applicable and that decision represented a minority position or precluded a majority vote a plan which had entered into a participation agreement could be required at the election of the relevant investment company to withdraw its investment in the particular fund or portfolio of a future investment company with no charge or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal  applicants also considered whether a “senior security” as such term is defined under section g of the  act may be created with respect to any variable contract owner as opposed to a participant under a qualified plan applicants concluded that the ability of the investment companies to sell shares of each fund or portfolio of a future investment company directly to qualified plans does not create a “senior security” which is defined under section g to start printed page include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends” regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under plans or contract owners under variable contracts the plans and the separate accounts only have rights with respect to their respective shares of the funds and the portfolios of future investment companies they only can redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of a fund or of a portfolio of a future investment company has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends  applicants also considered whether there are any conflicts between contract owners of the separate accounts and participants under the plans with respect to state insurance commissioners veto powers over investment objectives applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal that the interests and opinions of shareholders may differ does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among shareholders state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies usually cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest in another generally timeconsuming complex transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers conversely the trustees of qualified plans or participants in participantdirected qualified plans can make such decisions quickly and redeem their interests in a fund and reinvest in another funding vehicle without the regulatory impediments faced by the separate accounts or as is the case with most qualified plans even hold cash pending suitable investment applicants believe that issues where the interests of contract owners and qualified plans are in conflict can be almost immediately resolved since the trustees of or participants in the plans can on their own redeem the shares out of underlying funds  applicants also considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between participating insurance companies and qualified plans as a result of future changes in the tax laws applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts between the interests of participants in qualified plans and contract owners of the separate accounts resulting from future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners  applicants state that the foregoing list while not all inclusive is representative of issues which applicants believe are relevant to this application applicants believe that the discussion contained in the application demonstrates that the sale of shares of the funds and of portfolios of future investment companies to qualified plans does not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest further applicants submit that the use of the funds and portfolios of future investment companies with respect to qualified plans is not substantially dissimilar from their anticipated use with respect to variable contracts in that both are generally longterm retirement vehicles  applicants note that various factors have kept more insurance companies from offering variable contracts than currently offer them these factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding medium the lack of expertise with respect to investment management principally with respect to stock and money market investments and the lack of public name recognition of certain insurers as investment experts with which the public feels comfortable entrusting their investment dollars for example some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the variable contracts business on their own use of investment company portfolios such as the funds or portfolios of future investment companies as common investment media for variable contracts would reduce or eliminate these concerns applicants submit that mixed and shared funding also should provide several benefits to variable contract owners by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds applicants maintain that participating insurance companies will benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of the investment companies but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds mixed and shared funding also would make greater amounts of assets available for investment by the funds and the portfolios of future investment companies thereby promoting economies of scale permitting increased safety through greater diversification and making more feasible the addition of new funds and portfolios therefore making the investment companies available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts and this should result in increased competition in both variable contract design and pricing and hence in more product variation and lower charges applicants assert that the sale of shares of the funds and of portfolios of future investment companies to qualified plans in addition to separate accounts should enhance these results  applicants submit that regardless of the type of shareholder in the funds or portfolios of future investment companies the investment companies are or will be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage those funds or portfolios solely and exclusively in accordance with their respective investment objectives policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the board of directors of the applicable investment company the “board” the investment companies will work with pools of money and will not take into account the identities of shareholders thus each of the funds and the portfolios of future investment companies will be managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund applicants conditions applicants have consented to the following conditions  a majority of the board of each of the investment companies will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of such investment company as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death disqualification or bonafide resignation of any director or directors then the operation of this condition will be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application  the board of each of the investment companies will monitor such investment company for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict among the interests of the contract owners of all separate accounts and the participants under qualified plans investing in such investment company and will determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a start printed page variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretative letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of such investment company are being managed e a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners variable life insurance contract owners and trustees of qualified plans f a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners or g if applicable a decision by a qualified plan to disregard voting instructions of plan participants  the participating insurance companies any qualified plan that executes a participation agreement upon becoming an owner of  percent or more of the assets of any of the funds or the portfolios of future investment companies a “participating qualified plan” and capital management or any other investment adviser to the investment companies collectively the “participants” will report any potential or existing conflicts to the relevant board participants will be responsible for assisting the relevant board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for it to consider any issues raised this responsibility includes but is not limited to an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the relevant board whenever contract owners voting instructions are disregarded and if passthrough voting is applicable an obligation by each participating qualified plan to inform the relevant board whenever such plan has determined to disregard plan participants voting instructions the responsibility to report such information and contracts and to assist the board will be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies and participating qualified plans under their participation agreements with the investment companies and this responsibility will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the conflict owners or plan participants as applicable  if it is determined by a majority of a board or a majority of its disinterested members that a material irreconcilable conflict exists then the relevant participant will at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict up to and including a withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts or participating qualified plans from the relevant fund or portfolio of a future investment company and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium including another such fund or portfolio or in the case of participating insurance companies submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and as appropriate segregating the assets of any appropriate group ie annuity contract owners or life insurance contract owners of one or more participating insurance companies that votes in favor of such segregation or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change and b establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard contract owners voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then such insurer may be required at the election of the relevant investment company to withdraw such insurers separate accounts investment in such investment company with no charge or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a participating qualified plans decision to disregard plan participants voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote such plan may be required at the election of the relevant investment company to withdraw its investment in the relevant investment company with no charge or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal the responsibilities to take remedial action in the event of a board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be contractual obligations of all participating insurance companies and participating qualified plans under the participation agreements and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract owners or plan participants as applicable for purposes of this condition  a majority of the disinterested members of a board will determine whether or not any proposed action would adequately remedy any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will any of the investment companies or their investment advisers be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract no participating insurance company will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict further no participating qualified plan will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding medium for such plan if a a majority of the plan participants materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict vote to decline such offer or b pursuant to documents governing the plan the plan makes such decision without a vote of plan participants  a boards determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all participants  participating insurance companies will provide passthrough voting privileges to all contract owners so long as the commission continues to interpret the  act to require such passthrough voting accordingly such participants where applicable will vote shares of the applicable fund or portfolio of a future investment company held in their separate accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from contract owners participating insurance companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their separate accounts investing in a fund or portfolio of a future investment company calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other participating insurance companies all participating insurance companies will contractually agree to calculate voting privileges as providing in this application pursuant to their participation agreements with the investment companies each participating insurance company will vote shares for which it has not received timely voting instructions as well as shares it owns that are not attributable to variable contracts in the same proportion as it votes those shares for which it has received voting instructions each participating qualified plan will vote as required by start printed page applicable law and governing plan documents  each of the investment companies will comply with all provisions of the  act requiring voting by shareholders which for these purposes shall be the persons having a voting interest in the shares of the respective funds or portfolio of future investment companies and in particular will either provide for annual meetings except insofar as the commission interprets or may interpret section  of the  act not to require such meetings or comply with section c of the  act although the investment companies are not trusts of the type described in section c as well as with section a of the  act and if and when applicable section b of the  act in addition each of the investment companies will act in accordance with the commissions interpretation of the requirements of section a with respect to periodic elections of directors and with such rules as the commission may promulgate with respect thereto  each of the investment companies will notify all participants that it may be appropriate to include in separate account or plan prospectuses or other disclosure documents disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding each of the investment companies will disclose in its prospectus that a shares of such investment company may be offered to insurance company separate accounts of both variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts and if applicable to qualified plans b due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations the interests of various contract owners participating in such investment company and the interests of qualified plans investing in such investment company if applicable may conflict and c its board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action if any should be taken in response to any conflict  if and to the extent that rules e and et under the  act are amended or proposed rule e under the  act is adopted to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the  act or the rules promulgated thereunder with respect to mixed or shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in
