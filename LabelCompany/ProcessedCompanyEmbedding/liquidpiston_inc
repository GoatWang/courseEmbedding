engines havent been updated in  years over  years ago the thermodynamic cycles for otto gasoline and diesel cycles for internal combustion engines were developed — and the piston engine design hasn’t changed much since the days of henry ford liquid piston has designed a totally new type of rotary internal combustion engine technology the design is new the thermodynamic cycle is new the approach is rooted in physics and optimization the engine is up to x more efficient than comparable powered gasoline engines in production today and up to x smaller and lighter than comparable diesel engines multifuel capable much like a piston engine can be configured to run on different fuels the liquidpiston engine can do the same we have demonstrated the engine on gasoline diesel kerosene and jp fuels our most advanced engine prototype the cc sparkignited xmv engine has successfully run multiple types of fuel in a single configuration including gasoline and kerosene our cc x concept is intended to run compression ignition on diesel piston engine vs liquidpiston today’s gasoline engines in a typical automotive drive cycle only convert about  of the available energy in the fuel into useful mechanical work and  of the energy is then wasted as heat in the exhaust or out the radiator our approach fundamentally changes the thermodynamic cycle of the engine to make a much more efficient engine as a result our engine has the potential to be up to x more efficient vs a gasoline engine while also being incredibly power dense – about  times smaller and lighter than any other diesel engine out there it is also quieter and has near zero vibration in addition the x engine is incredibly simple – it has just two primary moving parts and yet it achieves three combustion events per rotor revolution resulting in tremendous power density video old school engine inefficiency the traditional combustion process is far from ideal today’s engines rely on injecting mixing and burning the fuel while the piston is near “top dead center” but it takes a long time by the time the engine is actually burning the fuel the piston is already expanding and the pressures are dropping due to expansion which fight the combustion so the engine is not efficiently converting the heat from combustion into mechanical work video liquid piston efficiency the ‘x’ rotary engine allows for a longer period to burn all of the fuel at a nearly constant combustion chamber volume the arc of the rotor matches the arc of the housing which means that the rotor can continue turning at high speed while the combustion chamber volume remains approximately constant for a longer period this gives the engine more time to burn the fuel resulting in a much more complete combustion process before it starts expanding the gases constant volume combustion has been shown thermodynamically to improve efficiency by  over a diesel engine  more efficient than other gas engines  smaller and lighter than comparable diesel engines  combustion events per rotor revolution today a kw diesel generator weighs  pounds imagine the impact if we can reduce that to less than  pounds such an ultraportable generator can be used in new applications for example to charge the battery of an electric vehicle rev or enable hybrid electric drones alexander shkolnik founder  ceo liquid piston liquidpiston vs wankel rotary engine see how it works the x engine is simple having only  moving parts – a rotor and a shaft yet it executes the optimized high efficiency hybrid cycle – potentially doubling the fuel economy of the engine while the it also achieves  combustion events per revolution making the engine incredible compact up to x smaller and lighter than today’s comparable power diesel engine the low part count and reduced raw material could make the engine significantly cheaper as well when volume production is reached how it works built and tested liquidpiston in action in june of  the xmini engine has been successfully installed into a vehicle demonstrator eg a gokart marking a significant milestone in development this milestone is the first time the engine is run outside the lab and shows the engine powering something tangible that users can feel significant development was required to move the engine from the lab and into this application especially in cooling the engine so it does not overheat developing the controls and mapping the engine across its operating band etc go kart demo short go kart demo long immediate use cases over the past two years liquidpiston has developed the xmv xmini cc spark ignited engine which is the company’s most advanced demonstrator to date an engine of this size could power everyday items like handheld lawn equipment including chainsaws or brush cutters small generators or small vehicles including mopeds gokarts etc as shown by our gokart video above this engine is demonstrated in and out of the lab and is already showing excellent power density lowvibration good fuel economy and ability to run on multiple fuels including gasoline or jp this is just the beginning our next engine platform will be the kw x diesel rotary engine the objective of the x program for which we are seeking dod development funding is to make a kw engine that will fit in a xx box weigh just  pounds and operate at  brake thermal efficiency  better efficiency than a heavy duty truck from an engine the size of a shoebox in addition to ultra compact and efficient generators and power for things like drones companies that produce electric vehicles including ground and air vehicles may also be interested to use our small ultra efficient engine as a range extender to charge their batteries and dramatically extend range or enable evs that use small cheap lightweight battery packs but still offer the consumer the range and ability to rapidly refuel their vehicles that drivers expect – all at a potentially lower co footprint as compared to plugging your ev into the us power grid ultimately we see our engine platform replacing any engine in use today addressing a  billion market opportunity before addressing the larger automotive and trucking markets our strategy is to identify initial niche applications where customers have an immediate and painful need for higher power to weight diesel engines and more fuel efficient engines to that end the company already has a lot of traction with the military which could be a great beachhead customer they need improved engines for vehicles generators drones power for other land sea and

alexander shkolnik ceo to potential investors september   we are a father and son team nick a physicist and accomplished inventor and alec an mittrained computer scientist we set out  years ago to fundamentally improve combustion engines in order to make an impact that will last for generations to come the reality of today’s engines is that  of the energy in fuel is wasted as unutilized heat that’s unnecessary and results in far too much co co nox and other emissions that negatively impact our environment there have been many incremental improvements to engines over the last century – but few breakthroughs have had significant impact our approach is rooted in physics we started with defining a new thermodynamic cycle and then experimented with different engine architectures to embody this cycle using available tools and materials after more than  years and m invested in development our fourth generation engine architecture the “x” engine is ready for launch the implications are profound in an era where we are emitting too much co and other pollutants and where the us imports  of our fuel from global sources our technology can have ramifications on the climate on national security as well as on consumer’s pocketbooks as we can save  billions for consumers at the pump we all recognize that trucks and automobiles are a dominant consumer of fuel and the past several years have seen a focus on “zero emission” vehicles eg electric vehicles evs unfortunately the reality is that the electricity comes mainly from burning oil gas and coal – with significant co footprints evs have additional issues – batteries are expensive and contain toxic materials motors use rare earth magnets etc ironically we do believe that electric cars will be the future – just not exactly how tesla’s elon musk envisions it we see our technology complementing eg “rangeextending” an ev utilizing a small lightweight inexpensive battery pack such an approach can lower the co footprint of the vehicle compared to charging a “pure” electric vehicle on the us power grid drivers would retain the range they are accustomed to and the ability to refuel rapidly at any fuel station using existing infrastructure while  of one’s daily driving could be accomplished in a single battery charge  a winning solution for everyone the irony does not escape us – we are proponents of electric vehicles who have started an internal combustion engine company we believe that the global economy will be dependent on fossil fuels for many decades and that engines used in transportation applications if optimized will complement electric power systems for optimal efficiency reliability and environmental sustainability with a range extended system we can take advantage of the benefits of both types of power generation unfortunately the designin time to adopt a new powertrain technology into the automobile industry can take up to  years this is not an appropriate time scale for a startup for this reason we have developed a phased technology roadmap that starts with engines that can serve the military our military forces have an immediate need for lighter smaller more efficient diesel heavy fuel engines our initial product lines will include a kw  hp enginegenerator and a kw  hp engine both of these products will find commercial applications beyond the military – in handheld power products small vehicles generators etc we currently have the xmini engine powering a gokart as a vehicle demonstrator our strategy is to prove the engine in these “niche” applications which by the way have total available markets measured in the tens of billions of dollars before launching a product for the automotive market thus we start with very big markets and end with huge markets the

work up to four days a month the rest of my time im playing tennis more investors more investors details expand all what are you guys building we’re developing a new type of engine we’re making a totally new type of rotary internal combustion engine technology innovating in both the physics thermodynamics and design of how current engines work it’s been over  years since the fundamental thermodynamic cycles for a combustion engine  basically how all heat engines operate  were introduced to the market the cycle describes the underlying physics of the engine not only have we developed an optimized cycle but we’ve built prototype engines to implement this new cycle and we are now ready to commercialize the technology that can be truly disruptive on a global scale our technology is really grounded in physics and we’re trying to fundamentally change the thermodynamics of the engine to make a much more efficient cycle we’re also embodying that cycle in a new type of engine design that offers still more efficiency while also being extremely compact and lightweight our engine will be up to  times smaller and lighter than any other diesel engine out there is quieter and has near zero vibration while potentially doubling the fuel efficiency over a gasoline engine how is it better than the current internal combustion engine we’re changing the physics processes of how the engine operates to make them more efficient today’s engines in a typical automotive drive cycle only convert about  of the available energy in the fuel into useful mechanical work and  of the energy is wasted as heat through exhaust friction and cooling losses consider the diesel engine which is known to be more efficient than a gasoline engine in reality the diesel combustion process is far from ideal diesels rely on injecting mixing and burning of the fuel while the piston is near “top dead center” but these processes actually take a long time by the time the engine is actually burning the fuel the piston is already expanding and the pressures are dropping so the engine is not converting all of the heat addition into useful work – its literally wasting this heat in the exhaust ideally the engine would try to bring the piston to a dead halt at the top dead center position to allow the fuel time to mix and burn but that’s almost impossible to do with a conventional piston architecture instead we are using a rotary engine which allows us a lot of flexibility in the geometry to allow for a longer period to burn all the fuel if you look at the operation of our engine you will see the arc of the rotor matches the arc of the housing this means that the rotor continues turning at high speed but near top dead center position the volume remains approximately constant for a longer period this gives the engine more time and therefore a much more complete combustion process before it starts expanding the gases even just applying this one feature of constant volume combustion the engine can extract  more energy vs a diesel engine the thermodynamics is described by the high efficiency hybrid cycle hehc that we developed it utilizes  a high compression ratio  constant volume combustion and  overexpansion of gas until approximately atmospheric pressure is attained the result is a  thermodynamic efficiency which is significantly improved over gasoline or diesel piston engines in use today for comparison the diesel cycle has a thermodynamic efficiency of  efficiency is important because it translates to lower cost less fuel consumption for users and longer range for mobile applications typical engine development is incremental and may change a single parameter often at the expense of another  we’re really trying to improve the engine in all parameters so we can combine a potential x improvement in fuel economy with up to a x reduction in size and weight over a diesel engine and because it’s x less material in volume production it’s anticipated to be quite a bit cheaper than today’s engines in a package that has little to no vibration is well balanced and responsive and relatively quiet what are the initial use cases we have two versions of the engine under development – the tiny cc spark ignited xmini v xmv which is working in the lab now as a proven engine prototype and a larger cc compression ignited diesel  jp “x” engine concept the x weighs a meager  pounds and fits in a xx” box – while producing  hp of power the x is a more optimized refined and longer term engine development program which is just in initial stages of the design phase ultimately we see the engine potentially replacing any combustion engine in use today but we’re starting with the military as a first potential customer we have a lot of traction with them already as they have such an immediate dire need for an improved engine right now the military relies on jp fuel which is a heavy fuel  so they are forced to use diesel engines which are big and heavy furthermore consider that it can take up to  gallons of fuel to deliver a single gallon to the frontline it’s not just expensive in terms of dollars this oil must be protected on its journey and we lose soldiers some times in protecting this fuel on its way to the frontline with the military costs can literally be measured in human lives so efficiency is especially critical they are a good customer for us because they are willing to help pay for development and in the long term are willing to purchase large numbers of engines to power all of their equipment in fact a single generator contract for one engine size can be on the order of m enough to build a viable business within the military there are a number of applications that our engine can serve with similar immediate and painful needs for better power systems for example consider the standard kw diesel generators that power mobile command centers today  they weigh  pounds and we could reduce this to   pounds a few people could lift and move this rather than a whole truck so it’s a really game changing technology we’re also looking at other applications for example drones power for other land sea and air vehicles robotics systems etc there’s just so many applications even within that one target customer of course the military is just a starting point  there are similar applications on the commercial side that we can move into when ready in the long term what kind of products will use your engine the first productapplication pathway is a prototype engine which we have been working on and which is running in the lab right now called the “x mini” this engine could be used to power for example various types of lawn equipment like chainsaws or leaf blowers the xmini is a sparkignited engine that displaces cc has  firing chambers despite of having just two moving parts is about the size of a grapefruit and weighs about  pounds even though it’s so tiny it’s produces hp right now and it’s on its way to producing up to  hp when fully developed still even at hp it’s already far better than anything out there today you’d get a lot more power lower the weight and because there’s no vibration you can use handheld equipment for longer without feeling like your hand will fall off we can also see applications in small vehicles like mopeds and drones which could also benefit from their light weight and lessened vibration we are also in discussions with the dod to develop a slightly larger engine this is a cc displacement engine that is expected to produce about  hp this engine will fit in a xx” box and weigh less than  pounds while the military applications eg drones and generators are obvious consider that cars are widely predicted to move more toward autonomous driving and electrification of the drivetrain and we want to incorporate our engines into future vehicles in a way that takes advantage of these changes there are electric cars with a  mile range but this range comes at the cost of having large heavy and expensive battery packs and and charging outside the home is a hassle we envision a car that has a small battery pack that can cover  of your daily driving needs and if you need longer range our generator would kick in it’d be lightweight and you could even have it as an “attachment” sitting in a little box in your trunk you could use that to charge up your batteries and then every couple hundred miles you could refuel the generator itself at any standard gas station rather than having to find a special charging station we therefore make evs affordable for everyone while allowing consumers the ability to rapidly refuel and the range they are accustomed to however perhaps even more important  as our engine is so efficient you’d actually have a lower co footprint if you charge your battery with our engine rather than plugging into the us power grid this is because the power grid relies on significant sources of fossil fuel and generation transmission distribution and charging networks turn out to be less efficient than a small generator based on our engine how long have you been working on this nick’s been working on the physics of the engine for something like  years as a physicist the inefficiency of presentday engines always bothered him and he saw this opportunity to make a much more efficient engine in the late s while he was a clean energy program manager working at an innovation think tank he did an analysis of what would be the most probable path of development for power conversion devices evaluating fuel cells supercapacitors batteries etc and concluded that basically engines are here to stay this conclusion has been affirmed by a number of studies and that’s when he decided to really make a push to invent a better engine that wasn’t so inefficient large and polluting we nick and alec teamed up in  and applied physics and optimization to improve the efficiency and fundamental operation of the combustion engine we think there’s a lot of room for improvement and that engines can be pushed to convert at least half of the fuel energy to actual work as opposed to the current  that’s a two to three time improvement in efficiency which can have a very big impact we were always targeting this ultra high efficiency and we’ve been actively working on this for about a decade when we first started out in  we thought we were going to do an auxiliary power unit for longhaul trucks it wasn’t until last year that we found out about this incredible need within the military and last year we entered into a contract with darpa defense advanced research projects agency which is basically the research arm of the military so far close to  million has been invested in the technology through venture capital and m through darpa we are now on our fourth completely new generation of the engine architecture this is the final configuration and embodies the same thermodynamic cycle as the original “liquidpiston” engine but each iteration got simpler easier to seal and you just can’t get any simpler than the ‘x’ engine that we have right now how technically challenging is what you’ve built the ‘x’ rotary engine is an incredibly simple device that has just two moving parts the rotor and the shaft still it implements all of the attributes of our optimized thermodynamic cycle that was the first thing we had to work out how to capture our cycle with a new kind of engine if you look at the wankel engine it has a peanutshaped housing and a triangular rotor our engine has the opposite  a peanut rotor inside a threelobed housing because of this inversion we can achieve a higher compression ratio constant volume combustion and over expansion the processes that characterize our improved high efficiency cycle second was the most critical aspect of any kind of rotary engine  the sealing which prevents gas from leaving your highpressure chamber when trying to achieve high efficiency it’s really important to keep the gas in the chamber unlike the wankel engine our apex seals are stationary so they don’t have the dynamics challenges that the old wankel engine did in addition we’re able to supply lubricant directly to these areas so the engine can be really durable we can reduce oil consumption by a full order of magnitude by directly lubricating the seals as opposed to consuming oil in the combustion chamber which is what the wankel does we can therefore solve the fuel consumption lubrication emissions and durability challenges experienced by the old wankel while sharing the inherent simplicity and compact operation of the rotary engine so its been quite the process first in selecting the most appropriate architecture to embody our cycle and then getting all of the implementation details right in fact most of the focus of our work with darpa this past year was focused around sealing once we figured that out we automatically have a much better combustion system will you manufacture the engines yourself or outsource it we’re not planning to take our engines into highvolume production directly we are opting for a capitalefficient business model that leverages our intellectual property position we will establish partnerships in the industry and in the defense base and work with manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers oems to bring our products to market ultimately we’re going to be designing custom engines and providing engineering and testing services as a subcontractor for the manufacturer this is pretty standard in the industry for example gm will usually subcontract their engine development as well to one of a handful of engine design houses like fev avl ricardo or iav we will ask them to fund our development for each program in addition – and in the long term this would become the largest income stream for the business we will also charge royalties and upfront license fees for engines produced by partners for us it’s incredibly important to find a first partner that will adopt and embrace the technology and take it to market and that is what we are working to achieve with highest priority how many patents do you have and what stage are they in the company has  patents that are issued or pending which cover the technology we are working with a great ip attorney bruce sunstein out of boston who is famous for patenting the segway our portfolio is deep  at the top we have issued patents that cover the entire thermodynamic cycle one layer down from the cycle we have issued patents that cover the ‘x’ engine architecture the next layer covers implementation details  for example the strategies for cooling lubricating and controlling the engine do you have customers right now right now we have two potential contracts with the dod that are in final stages of proposal evaluation these contracts could total up to over  million dollars and those could come through later this year these contracts don’t pay for everything but if we can get some of these military contracts with nondilutive funding in place it’ll really help us and investors along one of these funding sources takes technologies that are demonstrated but not quite to the point where they are ready to be embraced and they try to cross them over into that tipping point where they can be adopted that’s a  million program that we submitted in partnership with two major defense contractors  one of which is very wellknown for making drones and the other is a leader in providing military generator sets this is really great for us because not only does it fund our development of the product but we’ll also have a partnership with a manufacturer with the sales distribution and manufacturing channels to sell the product to the military at the end of this  month program and  million effort we’ll have a working running diesel generator that builds on our existing technology will be fieldtested by the army will be environmentally tested by our development partners and we will be lined up perfectly with a potential future strategic partner why is the military an ideal first customer for you a single generator contract in the military can be on the order of about  million that’s for a single contract for about a five year period and they’ll issue a new contract for every different engine size we can build a lucrative business just in this dod genset application we view it as a stepping stone to an ultimate vision but you can see how we can build a very nice and sustainable business here and they have relatively low barriers to entry in order to produce a new type of engine a company must meet emission standards warranty suitable durability for the customer’s application and a reasonable price to enter the market the military has clear performance needs and depending on the application durability and emissions standards that are generally more lax than the general consumer market making this early hurdle of production easier to get over it saves time and money at this stage to not have to worry about such stringent qualifications in the long term we are confident that the engine can meet today’s emissions and durability expectations but its beneficial to have a first customer that can relax these requirements what technical challenges do you still need to solve in the development process we have at least two phases research which is inventive and development which is more focused on engineering and productization for the xmv line where efficiency is less optimized our research is mostly done and we’re entering into the development stage where most of the problems become engineering tasks it’s a standard engineering development focused on durability and emission that will require time and resources but the major inventive processes have already been accomplished our next major phase will focus on increasing and providing durability all our efforts todate have been improving the performance and efficiency of our engine we have the engine running in steadystate so that it won’t overheat when you run it for a long period of time on our most recent engine we were able to run it for about  hours our next goal is  hours which is the basic requirement for epa certification as a handheld engine our ultimate goal is to have it run for hundreds or thousands of hours but that will require additional development for darpa we also have another program under way which is really pushing the limits of efficiency and the power density and tightly integrating the entire engine into a neat package so far we’ve been very focused on the engine core and have yet to focus on the package but the darpa program may cover that who are your competitors there are a couple other startups doing combustion engines most of them focus on relatively large engines because they’re going after the automotive and trucking industry which is worth hundreds of billions of dollars but even a very good proven technology can take about  years to be adopted into the general automotive space which is why we’ve moved away from that we’re focused on much smaller engines where there’s much less development but even though right now this is a step away from the auto industry we see a lot of room for growth even within that industry as more and more cars become selfdriving vehicles then you’ll really be looking for lighter vehicles and smaller engines and we’ll be wellpositioned for that how big is the market the market is  billion for combustion engines about  of that is cars and trucks but that still leaves over  billion for other applications that nonautomotive market is where we’ll initially enter still though that’s a huge market and you can carve out really niche applications that are still sizeable enough to build a business as an example the handheld equipment engine market is itself a  billion market longerterm as we noted earlier liquidpiston plans to be in the rangeextender engine market as the automotive industry increasingly becomes hybrid electric our power density and highefficiency will make our engine an ideal fit for that application how much will your engine cost in single quantity our  hp engine would cost about  and in fact we are planning on making limited quantities of “development kits” available to select strategic partners in a quantity of  the manufacturing cost of the engine core drops to a much lower number that’s competitive with piston engines except that we’re going to have a lot more power coming out of the package why are you guys the right team we have a really solid partnership and team with really complementary backgrounds i’m nick a mechanical engineer and physicist with a phd in physics from the university of connecticut all my life i have been interested in energy conversion devices and specifically engines my alec’s background is primarily technical i studied at emory university in computer science mathematics neuroscience and behavioral biology and did my masters jointly at georgia tech then i got my phd at mit in computer science with a focus on robotics funded by darpa i see all these things as being similar neurons and robots and engines they’re all technical systems with complicated dynamics i just like solving tough technical challenges and playing with models that’s what motivates me we founded the company while alec was doing his phd at mit while there we competed in the k competition and took second place beating over  teams our advisor in the competition became our first venture capital investor a few years later which really helped form the company from our background you can clearly see that we the founders are outsiders of the engine industry we believe this to be a great asset for the company as it is very difficult for people within the engine industry to overcome the psychological inertia that is inherent to all engineers and more generally to humans sometimes it takes an outsiders to see the world in a different light and to come up with understanding of problems and correspondingly with solutions which are “hidden” to insiders triz – russian acronym that stands for theory of inventive problem solving – helped us a lot in this process having said this we also recognize the fact that being outsiders read “amateurs” could be a great detriment to the company this is why from day one of our company existence we have surrounded ourselves with true experts in engine technology together we formed a winning combination of inventiveness rigorous analysis and methodical engineering which allowed us to solve myriads of technical challenges and finally to build a fully functional operating engine we have a few other people on the management team per suneby who got an mba from harvard business school and worked for ge and motorola doing program management about  years ago he jumped into startups and since then he’s been an entrepreneur working with various startups including liquidpiston as well as spending some time as a venture partner with a leading venture capital firm the other person to highlight is dr tony tether the former director of darpa he was the longest serving director in darpa’s history and managed over  billion in various technology development programs during his tenure we are honored to welcome tony to our board of directors and being really connected in the industry he can help connect us with potential military contractor partners what results show the improved efficiency state of the art automotive gasoline engines reach peak efficiencies around  brake thermal efficiency bte however their average efficiency over a typical drive cycle is only on the order of  because efficiency drops when the engine is not running in its sweet spot which it almost never is our xmv engine is a tiny engine – with an effective compression displacement of only cc per chamber the entire engine displaces cc but each individual chamber compresses only cc we have measured  bte on gasoline and extrapolated result of  bte on diesel based on firing one chamber for reference a competitive cc handheld gasoline engine documented in gordan blair’s textbook on engines achieves only  bte – so the xmv shows a  improvement already the xmv however was designed for low cost lawn and garden applications – it was not designed for optimal efficiency supported by various thermodynamic modeling tools extrapolating our engine to a larger size in the model when the x engine is scaled up to automotive size and operating on diesel fuel in compression ignition mode the engine can reach a peak efficiency of  and most importantly the average efficiency on the order of  the fuel consumption of the vehicle is directly proportional to this average efficiency read all answers view all questions ask a question  startups have raised  on wefunder wefunder supports three different federal laws
