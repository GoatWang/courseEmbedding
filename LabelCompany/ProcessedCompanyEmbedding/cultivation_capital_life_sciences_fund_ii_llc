capital meet bill schmidt managing partner at cultivation capital life sciences fund by tanya yatzeck  may   partner content what is thisestimated reading time  minutes as managing partner of the life sciences fund at cultivation capital bill schmidt is currently focused on the venture capital firm’s life sciences fund ii he’s dedicated to helping life sciences entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level–and the good news for founders is he’s done it himself we sat down with schmidt to hear how he got his start as a founder and now investor in st louis how did you start your career the career counseling conversation i had with my father was about a minute long  he said “well you’re really strong in math science physics and calculus–why don’t you try electrical engineering” and that’s what i did when i graduated from the university of wisconsin i went to work using my degree but i realized i didn’t want to sit by myself eight hours a day doing design work i wanted to get out and meet people so i switched to sales of very high tech products how did you become so knowledgeable about the business of health care a job transfer brought me to st louis and when i moved into an apartment complex here i met somebody who was from wisconsin he was the regional manager for united states surgical a medical device manufacturer and they were expanding their sales organization i thought “what kind of degree do you need to do this” and he said “i think you’d be perfect you’re smart and we want smart people who have selling skills” i joined them in early  the company introduced minimally invasive surgical instruments–surgical staplers clip appliers devices like that our intruments were used on the lungs the intestinal track the gall bladder the stomach you name it everything from the thoracic cavity down to the pelvic cavity the training was the hardest thing i had ever done you accepted a position with the company and about  of the people failed training exactly one week before you arrived for training  they sent you a training manual it was about three and half inches thick–surgical terminology anatomy physiology you had to know everything in that book down cold on the day you arrived after a quick meetandgreet they handed you a test  if you received a grade below a  on the test they sent you home for six weeks if you were awake you were studying it was really intense when i came out of training i had absolutely no fear of speaking to any doctor or key opinion leader because i knew the procedure we were doing i knew the anatomy i knew my instrumentation i knew my competitor’s instrumentation and i knew the surgery about to be performed there wasn’t a question that anyone in the room could ask me that i wouldn’t be able to answer i was that confident it was an unbelievable company to work for over the first four to five years i was there we went from m in sales to b it was fantastic growth i did some things inhouse then came back out into the field when i left the company in  i managed geography from chicago to denver in the field sales organizations what led you to entrepreneurship after united states surgical i had a very brief stint at a company called catalina health resource  myself and four other individuals at the company had a better idea and decided to create our own company and compete with them we formed our own company in october  it was a healthcare it company that we called ldm group we helped pharmaceutical manufacturers drive medication adherence by using technology we created a software platform that we fully integrated into the dispensing system at retail pharmacies such that as soon as the pharmacist typed in the relevant information into the dispensing system we would match up patients with specific messages sponsored by the pharmaceutical manufacturer typically we might have disease state information an  number for patient support or a coupon for  off your next prescription the goal was to engage patients so they would take a more active role in their health care our competitor our previous employer had a hardware and a software solution that had to be deployed in every pharmacy we took advantage of advanced in technology over time including broadband connectivity into pharmacies we developed a software only solution thus no hardware had to be deployed–so it was more capital efficient and our database operated in real time we had superior technology when did you know it was the right time to exit we sold ldm group to a private equity firm in late  the company was doing really well but we were in a regulated industry at any time the fda could if they chose to shut down patient messaging which our entire business was based upon pharmaceutical medication pricing is a conern for many including the fda you might have a brand spend m budget to run tv campaigns and print campaigns with all the pricing pressure the fda could shut down directtoconsumer messaging and eliminate that spend so we felt there was some risk there also our management dynamic was five equal owners in the business it was time to maybe have a single person running the company none of the five of us really wanted to relinquish our role so we just thought “we’ve attained a certain value that we’re all comfortable with maybe it’s time to exit” we wanted to exit in an all cash deal–we were not interested in an earnout structure on the back end i’d like to say for every one person where an earnout worked out well for the founder there’s probably  others in a group of  that would say “i didn’t get quite what i was looking for”  how did you get involved with cultivation capital it couldn’t have been more than a week after i transitioned out of my daytoday operating role when my wife looked at me and said “what are you going to do today” and i said “i don’t know”  she pointed to the baseboards in my kitchen and said “you know why don’t you touch up the baseboards” and i thought “oh my gosh i have to get out of the house i can’t do this honeydo list thing” right about the same time i was introduced to brian mathews managing partner of cultivation capital’s tech fund he introduced me to judy sindecuse who was running capital innovators brian and i were both mentors for one of the capital innovators cohorts we mentored different companies but every wednesday we were working alongside each other late in the program he approached me and said they were thinking of creating a healthcarelife sciences fund and that they needed a managing partner to serve as the glue get everything papered and put the team together after a lot of conversations with each of the tech fund partners i thought it was a really interesting and great opportunity we’re now coming up on four years for the life sciences fund at cultivation capital in june what is the most challenging thing about the work talent and capital are the biggest challenges most company miss their milestones they might raise capital and that capital might provide them  months of runway there are certain milestones they need to hit in that time period which will then allow them to go out for another successful capital raise everything seemingly takes twice as long as anyone thinks which means that now insiders have to bridge the company with additional funding to allow time for the company to progress we just initiated the life science fund ii and recently made our first investment in a company called narrativedx which we are really excited about tell us about the syndication my partners and i learned some things with the first fund one of the things i’m adamant about on our second fund is we build strong syndicates early this means we want to put together a strong group of investors early to minimize the financing risk as best we can  it will put the portfolio company in a much stronger position to build their business as quickly as possible thus if time slips the syndicate is better able to provide additional capital to bridge the gap and get the company to a much larger and successful capital raise what is the most rewarding part of what you do at cultivation capital when i was busy building ldm group with my partners we were headsdown almost with blinders on and not doing any networking locally all of our clients were on the east or west coast and we were just busy building a great company through cultivation capital probably by the virtue of the capital raise i have met so many great talented smart people in st louis many of these people are not only looking to make a nice return in this asset class or get involved in the startup community via investing but they also care deeply about st louis from an economic development and job creation point of view i think that that’s probably the most rewarding additionally we see a lot of deal flow which is really interesting out of our first  portfolio companies we looked at around  companiesopportunities seeing what all these companies are working on is just fascinating read schmidt’s  fundraising tips for biotech startups here this story was created in partnership with the
