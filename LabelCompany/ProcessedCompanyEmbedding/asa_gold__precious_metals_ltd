history investment team management team board of directors company asa gold and precious metals limited originally named americansouth african investment company limited was founded as a south african corporation in  the company was the idea of charles engelhard chairman of engelhard industries inc which at the time maintained extensive business interests in the united states and south africa    the company was organized to provide americans with a medium to invest in the common shares of companies engaged in the business of mining gold in south africa at the time americans were prohibited from owning gold bullion and  percent of the worlds gold was produced in south africa unlike today it was difficult for the average investor to purchase shares traded on the johannesburg stock market    originally asas investment policies required it to invest only in south african companies in  shareholders approved a proposal to allow the company to invest up to  percent of its assets outside of south africa later as it became evident that gold production in south africa was declining both absolutely and as a percentage of world production the company reached out to find opportunities in other parts of the world    in  the company moved its place of incorporation to bermuda because of a change in tax law in south africa that would have adversely affected asa and its shareholders shortly thereafter in  shareholders approved changes to the companys investment policies to permit the company to invest its assets worldwide without geographical restrictions    today asa gold and precious metals limited is a professionally managed globally diversified precious minerals closedend investment company the company is registered with the united states securities and exchange commission and its shares are listed on the new york stock exchange   factsheets  asa gold  precious metals asa gold asa gold and precious metals limited investor information investment strategy
