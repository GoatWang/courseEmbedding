spread will be  down from  in a loss coverage is adequate to support fitchs aaasfstressed assumptions strong loss performance credit and residual performance on volkswagen credit incs vci portfolio has been strong in recent years this is a result of robust obligor credit quality and a strong wholesale used vehicle market leading to elevated recovery rates and residual realizations evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market is expected to normalize following strong performance in recent years fitch expects increasing used vehicle supply from offlease vehicles and tradeins to pressure abs recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates fitchs analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak wholesale vehicle market performance in the derivation of residual and credit loss expectations stable originationunderwritingservicing fitch believes vci to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance fitch believes vci is capable of adequately servicing a legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of vci would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn would likely result in declines of credit enhancement and loss coverage levels available to the notes hence fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing the transactions initial base case rv and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate x and severe x stresses respectively they are also intended to provide an indication of the rating
