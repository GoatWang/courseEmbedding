speaker carl albert retired from congress and oneill was elected speaker in  the same year jimmy carter became president carter administrationedit with substantial majorities in both houses of congress and control of the white house oneill hoped that democrats would be able to implement democraticfavored legislation including universal health care and jobs programs the democrats however lacked party discipline and while the carter administration and oneill started out strong with the passage of ethics and energy packages in  there were major stumbles troubles began with carters threats to veto a water projects bill a pet project of many members of congress oneill and other democratic leaders were also upset by carters appointments of a number of his fellow georgians whom oneill considered arrogant and parochial to federal offices and white house staff oneill was also put off by carters frugal behavior in cutting executive staff and reducing the scale of white house entertaining carter a southern baptist even ended the practice of serving alcohol other than beer and wine at the white house as carters term began in early  democratic leaders on capitol hill were invited to the white house for a breakfast with the new president where carter served them sugar cookies and coffee oneill a man of expansive appetite expected the untilthentraditional eggs and sausage he looked across the table at carter and said mr president you know we won the election carter was a reformminded executive who often clashed with oneill on legislation the speaker wanted to reward loyal democrats with rewarding projects at a time when carter wanted to reduce government spending a continuing weak economy and the iran hostage crisis made prospects bleak for carter and the democrats in the  congressional and presidential elections reagan administrationedit oneill was a leading opponent of the reagan administrations domestic and defense policies following the  election

white house oneill also said that reagan was herbert hoover with a smile and a cheerleader for selfishness he also said that reagans policies meant that his presidency was one big christmas party for the rich privately oneill and reagan were always on cordial terms or as reagan himself put it in his memoirs they were friends after pm oneill in that same memoir when questioned by reagan regarding a personal attack against the president that made the paper explained that before pm its all politics reagan once compared oneill to the classic arcade game pacman in a speech saying that he was a round thing that gobbles up money he also once joked he had received a valentine card from oneill i knew it was from tip because the heart was bleeding oneill however gave tacit approval to democratic congressman charlie nesbitt wilson to implement the reagan doctrine in the sovietafghan war wilsons position on the appropriations committees and his close relations with cia officer gust avrakotos allowed him to steer billions of dollars to the mujahideen through the cia and zia ulhaqs isi there was some contention about constitutional order of succession which involved oneill when reagan was shot in march  thensecretary of state alexander haig famously said he was in control here in response to a question as to who was in charge with the president under anesthesia and vice president george bush traveling but it was later pointed out that oneill was next in line after bush reagan was only under for a few hours and no formal invocation of the line of succession took place northern irelandedit one of oneills greatest accomplishments as speaker involved northern ireland oneill worked with fellow irishamerican politicians new york governor hugh carey senator ted kennedy and senator daniel patrick moynihan to craft a peace accord between the warring factions beginning with the saint patricks day declaration in  denouncing violence in northern ireland and culminating with the irish aid package upon the signing of the angloirish agreement in  the four horsemen as they were called convinced both carter and reagan to press the british government on the subject oneill also created the friends of ireland organization with kennedy and moynihan in  to promote peace in northern ireland postspeakershipedit oneill with congresswoman and future speaker nancy pelosi after
