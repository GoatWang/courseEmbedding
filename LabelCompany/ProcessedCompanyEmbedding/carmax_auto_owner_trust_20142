part of its ongoing surveillance fitch ratings has affirmed four classes and upgraded one class of outstanding notes of carmax auto owner trust  a full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release key rating drivers the rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and loss performance the collateral pool continues to perform within fitchs expectations based on the current structure and credit enhancement the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents the positive outlook for the class d notes reflects fitchs expectation of potential positive rating actions in the next    months the ratings reflect the quality of carmax business services llcs retail auto loan originations the strength of its servicing capabilities and the sound financial and legal structure of the transactions rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x and x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation to date the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses well within fitchs initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels therefore a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings due diligence

lowest for thirdparty sites“the common bond among topperforming thirdparty auto sites is a heavy reliance on the ‘visual web’ with its very streamlined easytouse site navigation features” said arianne walker senior director of marketing analytics at jd power “expectations continue to increase not only because auto manufacturers have such visually stimulating sites but because websites in many categories have focused on enhancing visual aesthetics and easy navigation if thirdparty sites want to maintain and increase their usage among shoppers they need to consider the impact appearance has on satisfaction and continually work to improve the look and feel of the website to keep up with the ever changing expectations of shoppers”following are the key findings of the  studyvisual web influences site preference the study finds that the highestscoring thirdparty auto websites employ heavy use of visual web design elements such as edgetoedge imagery cleaner spacing and aesthetically pleasing calltoaction colorsexpert reviews must cover the basics content is king when it comes to satisfying shoppers on thirdparty sites which includes ratings and reviews shoppers indicate the most

right away jim had taken a job on the east coast as a sales manager for a large software firm he was planning to buy a  lexus ls  once they got settled in they used the highlander until the day before they needed to move because they figured they could sell it on craigslist pretty quickly they placed an ad and two hours later they removed the ad in fear for their lives just kidding but they did take the ad down right away because the phone was ringing off the hook and they hadnt talked to one person who they were comfortable with having come to their house jim remembered having seen a television ad for a company called we buy cars he remembered that they purchased cars really fast and the process seemed really straightforward he found webuycarscom on the internet and gave them a

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
