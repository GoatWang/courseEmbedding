management co llc manager of quantactive equity strategies for institutional investors has launched a high capacity small core strategy designed to provide investors greater active exposure to a wide range of small cap stocksthe small core strategy officially launched in the fourth quarter of  and has already received tractionwe not only have interest from a number of institutional investors in the small core strategy but weve already received funding from two plans our firms aim is to create compelling cutting edge product choices that suit the dynamic needs of our clients and we think this early interest and commitment from these institutions validates our efforts and expertise says james francis president and ceo paradigmmany large institutional plans are unable to achieve an optimum active exposure to small cap stocks due to their size adds francis we created the small core strategy because we recognized that many institutional investors who would prefer to have access to an alpha rich small cap approach with consistent reliable performance have been shut out due to capacity constraints and have had to settle for passive exposure we believe this new strategy will help fulfill those needsaccording to greg pai managing director paradigm the small core strategy is representative of paradigms next generation products that feature security level research more akin to fundamental analysis combined with the breadth of coverage typically associated with pure quantitative productsit leverages our research database designed to identify key performance drivers within the small cap style in addition it incorporates paradigms alphamax ranking process that is applied to a proprietary universe of over  securities on a monthly basis this process allows the portfolio to dynamically track the pulse of small cap in terms of security sector and fundamental leadershipin keeping with the firms overall investment philosophy we use our distinctive research resources and  years of small cap investment experience to achieve superior returns while reducing unintended risk for our institutional clients says paifrancis said that the small core product was designed to produce   annualized excess return with a   tracking error relative to the russell  indexthe small core portfolio will be managed utilizing a team approach led by francis pai and jeffrey marcus senior
