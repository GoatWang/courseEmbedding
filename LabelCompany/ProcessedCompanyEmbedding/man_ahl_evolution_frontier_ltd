financial statements page  for further detail manny roman chief executive officer of man said while the first quarter of the year saw a more stable environment in financial markets which benefitted all of our strategies and in particular ahls momentum strategies the second quarter was characterised by renewed volatility as a result ahls momentum strategies gave back the gains they had made in the first quarter however glg numeric and frms strategies generated good risk adjusted returns adding to their strong start to the year flows for the half were skewed by  billion of net outflows from our japan corealpha strategy as some investors redeemed following a long period of strong absolute and relative performance we saw solid flows into our quant strategies including one large institutional mandate into ahl however elsewhere investor appetite remained muted as renewed market volatility tempered investors willingness to put their money to work markets remain very challenging and accordingly we remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year as ever we remain committed to investing in talent research and technology and building the optimal environment to deliver superior risk adjusted performance for our clients which will ultimately translate into the delivery of value for our shareholders dividend mans dividend policy is to pay at least  of adjusted management fee earnings per share in each financial year by way of ordinary dividend in addition the group expects to generate significant surplus capital over time primarily from net performance fee earnings available surpluses after taking into account required capital including accruals for future earnout payments potential strategic opportunities and a prudent buffer will be distributed to shareholders over time by way of higher dividend payments andor share repurchases whilst the board continues to consider dividends as the primary method of returning capital to shareholders it will continue to execute share repurchases when advantageous in line with this policy the board has declared an interim dividend for the year to  december  of  cents per share being the adjusted management

strategy as some clients chose to redeem after a sustained period of strong performance we saw solid flows into our quant strategies including one large institutional mandate into ahl however elsewhere investor appetite remained muted as renewed market volatility tempered clients risk appetite the acquisitions of silvermine newsmith and bamls fund of funds business and strong long only investment performance drove an  increase in fum to  billion at  june  adjusted profit before tax increased by  versus h  due to a more than twofold increase in ahl performance fees the majority of which were earned in the first quarter adjusted management fee pbt was up  versus h  with the increase in fum being partially offset by a continued decline in the group management fee margin driven by business mix shifts statutory profit before tax was up  to  million market overview after a very strong start to the year across most markets april marked a turning point for market behaviour in  concerns over greeces exit from the euro caused a selloff in european bond markets at the end of april and as the debt repayment date at the end of june loomed currency and equity markets were impacted a number of markets gave back gains made in the first quarter with the ftse  ending the six months to  june  down  the sp  up  and world bonds and corporate bonds down  and  respectively investment performance against this backdrop absolute performance across our four investment managers was varied ahls trend following strategies had a strong start to the year benefitting from trends in fixed income and equities markets returns were impacted in the second quarter however by the sharp reversal in european bond markets at the end of april and by volatility in equities and fx as well as sharp reversals in grain markets during june the result was that performance for the ahl diversified programme was down  to  june  and the ahl alpha strategy which runs at lower volatility was down  the ahl evolution strategy which trades a range of nontraditional markets not typically traded by cta managers was up  for the half and ahls multistrategy quantitative fund ahl dimension was up  the long only europe plus strategy was up  to  june  but it underperformed its benchmark by  tailprotect was down  but outperformed its benchmark by  the strong performance in the first quarter resulted in ahl recording  million of performance fees in h  with over  of these being earned from diversified and alpha strategies in the first quarter of the year and the remainder from evolution numerics range of strategies performed well in the first half of  since numeric manages a variety of strategies that encompass many markets the best indicator of numerics overall performance is the asset weighted outperformance versus benchmark this was  basis points before fees in the six months to  june  the aggregate performance was led by stronger performing strategies including global core outperforming its benchmark by  and emerging markets core outperforming its benchmark by  partially offset by weaker performance in us small cap underperforming its benchmark by  this strong performance resulted in numeric recording  million of performance fees in the first half discretionary hedge fund performance at glg over the first half was strong and broadbased with almost all strategies delivering positive absolute returns some of the stronger performers included european long short  market neutral  and the recently acquired newsmith japan new horizons  man glg multistrategy which allocates across a range of internal styles finished the period up  outperforming the hfrx index by  in h this performance resulted in glg recording  million of performance fees in the first half the majority of which were from equity long short strategies performance was also very strong within some of our key long only strategies in both absolute and relative terms in particular our japan corealpha strategy was up  outperforming its benchmark by  our european equity strategy was up  outperforming its benchmark by  and the undervalued assets strategy was up  outperforming its benchmark by  in the six months to  june  frm products had mainly positive performance in the first six months of the year actively managed diversified portfolios with exposure across strategies such as frm diversified ii made a positive return of   ahead of the benchmark statistical arbitrage performance was buoyant with frm equity alpha returning  frm earned performance fees of  million in the first half the majority of which were from the frm diversified and managed futures strategies business development quant ahl at ahl good progress has been made in building a more diversified quant business with  of ahls assets now in nontraditional strategies the marketing of the multistrategy dimension product continues to progress well with sales of  billion in the first half of  and there is some further capacity in this strategy to sell in the remainder of the year and beyond the four ucits products have had strong performance since launch at the end of  and we are seeing traction from a sales perspective in two of the products multistrategy and volatility with assets of around  million in each of these products at  june  ahls research effort continues to focus on adding new markets and models to our existing strategies as well as developing new strategies to further diversify and broaden the quant product offering as an example ahl launched the evolution frontier fund in may it applies ahls core momentum models to a very innovative set of markets which are less well known to other quantitative as well as discretionary investment managers these markets which are typically more lightly traded and harder to access are arguably also more inefficient and therefore present a very exciting opportunity for early adopters such as ahl given recent negative performance in the ahl diversified and alpha strategies material retail sales of these products are unlikely in the nearterm in our view although we continue to see more reasonable levels of interest from institutional investors across a range of strategies quant numeric the numeric business continues to perform well and good progress has been made during the half to integrate numerics operations onto the man platform since acquisition numeric has been leveraging the groups relationships with institutions around the world and in march we started marketing the two ucits strategies market neutral and emerging markets developed towards the end of  to high net worth and institutional clients around europe since acquisition numeric has raised gross fum of  billion with total fum increasing from  billion to  billion at  june  the outlook for flows into numeric for the second half is encouraging discretionary glg at glg the acquisitions of silvermine and newsmith were completed in the first half of the year silvermine a connecticutbased leveraged loan manager with  billion of assets further expands our existing credit business and positions us to benefit from strong demand for us clos and other credit strategies we launched two new clos in the second quarter one in the us and one in europe which together raised over  million of assets silvermine has been smoothly integrated into glg and we now manage all of our us clo business within silvermine transferring the existing glg clos across post the close of the acquisition the newsmith acquisition which completed in april added  billion of assets across a range of equity strategies and brings further alternatives and long only expertise to the glg platform and an even closer relationship with sumi trust newsmiths investment business has been transferred in full onto glgs platform and its operations are now fully integrated the japan corealpha strategy was reopened for investment in may  following closure towards the end of  principally due to capacity becoming available across the strategy and given its strong track record of absolute and relative performance we expect to see flows back into that strategy we would not expect to see meaningful flows into our alternatives strategies until we have a more sustained period of positive absolute performance we continue to attract talent to broaden out both our alternatives and long only product offering on the alternatives side himanshu gulati joined our new york office in february from perry capital as head of us special situations this strategy launched on st july with  million we have added a number of talented managers to our european equity alternatives team including moni sternbach who is managing our european midcap alternative strategy in the long only business we appointed simon pickard and edward cole from carmignac to run an unconstrained emerging market equity strategy recent hires continue to make progress pierrehenri flamands value opportunities strategy has performed well since launch in q last year henry dixons undervalued asset strategy continues to perform well and is raising assets with fum of over  million while rory powes european equity strategy has had very strong performance and we are beginning to market that strategy fund of hedge funds frm in early may we completed the acquisition of the fund of funds business of bank of america merrill lynch adding a  billion portfolio of multistrategy and strategyfocused funds to frm supported by a proven distribution platform these portfolios are now fully managed by frm and work is underway to review the underlying managers in the acquired portfolios and concentrate the manager list from an asset raising perspective we continue to make progress in our managed accounts offering we were recently awarded a mandate in excess of  billion by a large usbased state pension plan and this together with the infrastructure mandate won in late  will fund towards the end of  and throughout  in addition we have won two significant fund of funds mandates from uk local authorities totalling  million of fum despite these mandate wins and solid performance in the first half of  weaker than expected flows and adverse fx moves which impacted costs led us to impair the frm goodwill by  million distribution the first half of  has been muted in terms of flows with gross sales of  billion down  compared to the first half of  largely as a result of lower glg sales sales of glgs equity long short strategies suffered following negative investment performance in  and the japan corealpha strategy which sold very well in the first half of  was soft closed in late  and only reopened for investment towards the end of the q  quant product sales were better in the half with strong inflows to the ahl dimension strategy and various of numerics strategies redemptions were  billion in the six months to  june  up from  billion in the first half of  however this figure was skewed by  billion of redemptions in japan corealpha and a handful of large redemptions from our fund of funds business totalling  billion the majority of the demand continues to come from institutions with institutional sales in the period constituting  of total sales our business is more institutional in nature at  june  over  of the groups assets were from institutions with larger individual mandates causing greater variation in flows from one period to the next from a geographical perspective emea continues to be our biggest market with sales from this region comprising  of the total in the six months to june  sales from the asia pacific region comprised  of total sales including one  billion mandate and  or bn of sales were from the americas up  from the first half of  efficiency having completed the cost reduction programme a little ahead of schedule in  our focus in  has shifted towards sustaining our focus on efficiency and ensuring that our cost base enables us to address both the opportunities and risks in our business appropriately we continue to invest in new investment talent as outlined above and there are a number of areas in which we are investing in the infrastructure of our business which will be reflected in higher capex relative to recent years our balance sheet remains strong and liquid with net tangible assets of  billion or  cents per share at  june  in june we renegotiated our revolving credit facility reducing its size from  million to  million and extending the maturity to  with two oneyear extension options the facility remains available and undrawn and the reduction in the size of the facility coupled with an improved credit rating from fitch from bbb to bbb has resulted in annual commitment fee savings of  million as we have previously outlined we have increased the capacity of our seed capital programme to help to grow the business as we launch new products over time the book is sized in accordance with a value at risk var limit of  million and in aggregate stood at  million at  june  see note  to the financial statements for further detail we expect the aggregate size of the book could reach up to  million but will continue to be managed within var limits the seed book consists of fund investments that will be redeemed as soon as practicable typically within  months as the funds are marketed to clients and which will be hedged whenever possible particularly for long only funds in addition we include in the seed book loans to structured product funds which are made on a discretionary basis and can be called at any time  million at  june  and a small residual balance of less liquid assets that remain from the  financial crisis  million at  june  on  may  we completed the  million share repurchase announced in february at an average price of p buying back  million shares in total since march  we have repurchased  million shares at an average price of p surplus capital at  june  was  million with the decrease from the  december  position of  million being primarily due to the payment of the final dividend the share repurchase the capital usage related to acquisitions and an increased regulatory capital requirement related to higher seed investments partially offset by the inclusion of the h  posttax profits once they had been independently verified by the auditors surplus capital is around  million after taking into account the impact of interim profits which are not included in the  june  figure until they have been verified and the payment of the interim dividend key performance indicators kpis the definition and calculation of our financial kpis are presented on page  of our annual report for the year ended  december  they illustrate and measure the relationship between the investment experience of our fund investors our financial performance and the creation of shareholder value over time the kpis are used on a regular basis to evaluate progress against our four key priorities performance growth distribution and efficiency the results of our kpis for the six month period to  june  reflect the recent market volatility and the uncertain macro environment in which we operate with strong investment performance for ahl in the first quarter being largely reversed in the second quarter glg frm and numeric investment performance have all been ahead of their benchmarks however as our business continues to become more institutional in nature larger individual mandates have caused greater variation in flows on a quarterly or semiannual basis and as a result net outflows have been recorded in h  the general business mix shift from higher margin retail assets to lower margin institutional assets continues to have an adverse impact on management fee margins and management fee eps growth with both these kpis being towards the bottom of their target range investment performance for the six months to  june  we are achieving three out of the four performance targets as ahls performance of  is below two of the three relevant peer benchmarks of   and  glg has performance of  and is above the relevant benchmark of  frm has positive performance of  and is higher than the relevant benchmark of  and numeric has generated asset weighted alpha of  before fees the numeric kpi has been added with effect from  january  this metric monitors the asset weighted outperformance or underperformance of each numeric strategy based on a predetermined benchmark for each strategy net flows the target for this kpi is  net inflows each year net flows are below the target range for the six months to  june  with an annualised net outflow of  compared to a net inflow of  for the year to  december  net inflows in alternatives are more than offset by net outflows in long only discretionary strategies particularly from japan corealpha as discussed above adjusted management fee ebitda margin the target for this kpi is  our adjusted management fee ebitda margin is a measure of our underlying profitability the adjusted management fee ebitda margin of  is within the target range for the six months to  june  compared to  for the year to  december  this margin is declining as a result of the roll off of higher margin guaranteed product fum and the general mix shift from higher margin retail assets to

our total gross margin has decreased from  basis points for the year ended  december  to  basis points for the six months ended  june  our total net margin has decreased from  basis points to  basis

entities man assesses such relationships on an ongoing basis to determine whether each fund entity is controlled and therefore consolidated into the groups results assessment of the control characteristics for all relationships with fund entities led to the consolidation of four fund entities for the six months ended  june   december  five which are either classified as held for sale or consolidated on a line by line basis based on their nature the interests of thirdparties in funds that are consolidated are classified as liabilities as further detailed in note  the areas of

adjusted profit before tax statutory profit before tax is adjusted to give a fuller understanding of the underlying profitability of the business the directors consider that the groups profit is most meaningful when considered on a basis which excludes restructuring costs impairment of assets acquisition and disposal related items including noncash items such as amortisation of purchased intangibles and deferred tax movements relating to the recognition of tax losses in the us and certain nonrecurring gains or losses which therefore reflect the recurring revenues and costs that drive
