et in major reversal trump says china ‘not currency manipulators’ by andrew rafferty share share tweet comment email print advertisement president donald trump said wednesday that he no longer believes china manipulates its currency a complete shift from the position he repeatedly took during his  campaign “they’re not currency manipulators” trump told the the wall street journal during an oval office interview the reason he changed his mind the president said was because china has stopped manipulating its currency in recent months and the accusations could jeopardize us negotiations with china to deal with the nuclear threat from north korea did china ask us if it was ok to devalue their currency making it hard for our companies to compete heavily tax our products going into— donald j trump realdonaldtrump december   their country the us doesnt tax them or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the south china sea i dont think so— donald j trump realdonaldtrump december   trumps flip flop comes just days after the president hosted his chinese counterpart xi jinping at maralago in southern florida throughout the campaign trump repeatedly said he would instruct his treasury secretary to label china “a currency manipulator” and as recently as  days ago he told the financial times that china was the world champion of currency manipulators the official label would need to be included in a semiannual treasury report expected this month play facebook twitter embed rex tillerson presses china on north korea us warns preemptive strike is on the table  autoplay autoplay copy this code to your website or blog senate minority leader chuck schumer a longtime critic of how the chinese government values its currency released a statement saying trump is giving china “a green light to steal our jobs and wealth time and time again” “the best way to get china to cooperate with north korea is to be tough on them with trade which is the number one thing china’s government cares about” schumer said related are chinese troops massing on the north korean border trump also signaled in the interview with the journal that he may be willing to change his position on renominating federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen next year trump had accused yellen of keeping interest rates low for political reasons under president barack obama but on wednesday he said he likes a lowinterest rate policy “i think our dollar is getting too strong and partially that’s my fault because people have confidence in me but that’s hurting — that will hurt ultimately” trump said he said yellen was “not toast” and he would consider renominating her next year andrew rafferty twitter facebook google plus email topic politics news first published apr    pm

impose a very major border tax bob bryan jan    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print president donald trump meeting with top american ceos chip somodevillagetty images president donald trump said in a meeting with ceos on monday that his administration would prioritize tax cuts for corporations and decreasing regulation in its first days trump speaking with ceos including kevin plank of under armour elon musk of tesla and mark fields of ford promised to cut regulations by  maybe more trump said regulations regarding worker safety would be just as strong and just as protective of the people but that current regulations make it impossible to get anything built it is unclear whether trump is seeking to cut the cost of regulations or their total number trump also reiterated threats to impose a significant border tax on companies that move production outside of the us to other countries if you go to another country and you decide that youre going to close and get rid of  people or  people  we are going to be imposing a very major border tax on the product when it comes in trump said the move on trade also comes as trump is expected to sign an executive order that would renegotiate the north american free trade agreement or nafta and pull the us out of the transpacific partnership he also reiterated a campaign promise to cut corporate taxes — and taxes for the middle class overall were going to be cutting taxes massively for both the middle class and for companies and thats massively trump said were trying to get it down to anywhere from  to  and its now  but its probably more  than it is  the current federal corporate tax rate is  and it averages  for companies when state taxes are added the goal according to trump is to bring back manufacturing to our country he said there would be breaks for companies that create products in the us there will be advantages to companies that do indeed make their products here trump said trump also said he plans to hold meetings with the ceos on a quarterly basis or whenever they want to in order to address their concerns following the meeting the business leaders appeared outside of the white house with andrew liveris ceo of dow chemical speaking to reporters liveris said trump was engaged in the meeting and also addressed concerns over a border tax we did talk about the border tax quite a bit and we did talk about the sort of industries that might be helped or hurt by that said liveris look i would take the president at his word here hes not going to do anything to harm competitiveness hes actually going to make us all more competitive liveris also said that the business leaders were going to come back in  days with a plan to help to us manufacturing sector  here is the full list of executives
