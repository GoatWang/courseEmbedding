investment involves foreign currency it may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates investors may not get back the amount originally invested the following is a summary of only some of the risk factors which may apply to an investment in a product or a segregated account managed by scm collectively an “account” investment and trading risk all investments risk the loss of capital investing in emerging markets the account will invest primarily in securities traded outside of the united states which entail risks typically not associated with investing in us securities or property such as less publicly available information accounting auditing and financial reporting standards not comparable to those of us companies limited volume in securities markets more volatile prices slower settlement less extensive regulation and additional costs concentration of investments the investment adviser may hold few and relatively large securities positions in relation to the account’s capital that could result in a loss that materially reduces the account’s capital equity securities the prices of these may be affected by general economic and market conditions such as a broad decline in stock market prices or by conditions affecting specific issuers such as changes in earnings forecasts small and midcap securities the account invests in such securities the stock prices of which can be highly volatile these companies may experience higher rates of bankruptcy or other failures than larger companies and they may be more likely to be negatively affected by changes in management fixed income securities the account will invest in fixed income securities which may be below “investment grade” and face adverse business financial or economic conditions that could lead to the issuer’s inability to meet timely interest and principal payments companies that issue such securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing a major economic recession could severely disrupt the market for such securities and it is likely that any such economic downturn could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such securities to repay principal and pay interest thereon and increase the incidence of default for such securities convertible instruments if a convertible instrument held by the account is called for redemption the account will be required to permit the issuer to redeem the instrument or convert it into the underlying stock and will hold the stock to the extent the investment adviser determines that such equity investment is consistent with the investment objective of the account currencies the account will invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the currency in which the account is valued and therefore the value of the account’s assets will fluctuate with us dollar exchange rates as well as with price changes of the account’s investments in the various local markets and currencies illiquid assets certain investment positions of the account may become illiquid and such investments may require a significant amount of time from the date of initial investment before disposition limited liquidity an investment in the account is not freely transferable and withdrawals are generally permitted only at certain periods upon prior written notice valuation risks certain securities held by the account may be difficult to value and third party pricing information for the account’s securities or other investments may not always be available absence of regulatory oversight the account does not intend to register under the investment company act of  as amended the “investment company act” and interests in the account are not registered under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” imposition of tax regardless of cash distributions the account may generate taxable income for a member even though the value of the member’s interest in the account has declined a member may have to use personal funds to pay the income tax owed on the income or gain allocated to the member brokerage the investment adviser need not seek the lowest available commission cost and may cause commissions to be paid to a broker that pays for research or other services at a higher price than that which might be charged by another broker or dealer for effecting the same transaction inkind distributions members may receive inkind distributions of securities or obligations in the account’s portfolio which may not be readily marketable or saleable conflicts of interest the investment adviser may from time to time face conflicts of interest relating to its dealings with the account the foregoing summary list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an investment in the account prospective investors consult with their own legal tax and financial

to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the

growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic

more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability
