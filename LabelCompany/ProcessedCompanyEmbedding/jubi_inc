platform  jubi inc microlearning platform corporate training platform – gamification is the future corporate training platform tools and software have become increasingly important in generating engagement amongst employee bases with a shift in how employee learning should be carried out it’s never been more important to have the right software for the job and the right employee engagement software should involve elements of microlearning and ‘gamification’ you may have heard of microlearning – the method that utilizes bitesized chunks of knowledge and passes them onto your employee base for immediate use in their everyday role – but what about gamification what is it well it’s a system of employee learning that is becoming more and more adopted by the corporate world with mobile learning and mlearning becoming more relevant due to the widespread availability of smartphones and mobile internet there’s a need to build an experience suited to these platforms and suited to employee engagement just taking the ‘e’ out of elearning and replacing it with an ‘m’ isn’t going to cut it your employee base engages with their smartphones everyday – they have become used to the way content is packaged and presented to them instead of presenting them with an outdated experience when it comes to employee learning why not have corporate training software that emulates these apps and social games gamification does just that taking game mechanics such as points badges leaderboards and levels gamification creates a sense of achievement when an employee completes their bitesized training modules they can earn points badges or move up the leaderboard this can create some healthy competition between your staff foster a constant loop of achievement and recognition and – most importantly – makes the employee learning process fun at jubi inc our whitelabel corporate training platform has been developed with all of this in mind we’ve made the user learning experience fun and easytouse across all devices not just for employees but also for managers too with analytics and easytoread data for more information please go to httpwwwgetjubicom or call 77 schedule time
