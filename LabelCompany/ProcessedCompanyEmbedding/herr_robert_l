insurance personal insurance commercial insurance referral contact usdirections senior drivers it is a fact that the majority of traffic accidents include drivers that at opposite ends of the age spectrum the biggest concern has always been new drivers teens will always cause more than their share of accidents because they dont have the experience or maturity to drive with as much care as they should but inevitably time passes and their driving improves however that improvement doesnt last forever as drivers continue to age sometimes driving skills star to decline it is up to us as individual drivers to address how we handle our ability to drive a car van truck or suv it is important to recognize that older drivers can make adjustments it probably comes at no surprise that the easiest way to adjust driving habits is to pay greater attention to traffic signs signals and speed limits obeying posted instructions will decrease the chance that an older driver will have to rely on deteriorating eyesight and slower reflexes to avoid an emergency situation some states have laws that increase requirements for older drivers to renew their driving privileges however such requirements such as shorter licensing periods and mandatory driving tests dont occur until drivers are well past  years of age it makes more sense for drivers to change their habits as well as look for ways to objectively assess their current driving skills mature drivers should consider the following consider restricting driving to nonpeak hours whenever practicalavoid driving in poorer weatheravoid driving at nightbe aware of how any prescription medicines may affect vehicle operationvoluntarily take driving tests so an objective party can evaluate skillssearch websites such as those sponsored by state motor vehicle departments senior associations or driving clubs which offer selfassessment questionnairesreduce distractions while driving choose minimal or no use of cell phones audio devices etcbe more sensitive to feelings of fatigue and dont drive while tiredwhen circumstances call for it consider giving up your license and depend on other means of transportation
