as filed� �alternative�formats� p ��memorandum�� � exhibit q northwestern mutual variable life account variable complife� description of issuance transfer and redemption procedures for variable life insurance contracts pursuant to rule ebii introduction  rule eb under the investment company act provides exemption from sections d e and c of the act and rule c thereunder for variable life insurance policies which meet the conditions of the rule rule e has not been amended to reflect the addition of section�i  rule c provides exemptions for a registered variable life insurance separate account which registers under section� of the act except for exemption from the registration requirements �under the same terms and conditions as a separate account claiming exemption under rule e� therefore a separate account with registers as contemplated by rule c may be required to include the materials referred to in rule ebii as an exhibit to its registration statement filed under the act the purpose of this memorandum is to fulfill this requirement with respect to the variable life insurance policies �policies� previously offered in connection with northwestern mutual variable life account �separate account� a separate investment account of the northwestern mutual life insurance company �northwestern mutual�  assets held in the separate account consist entirely of interest in shares of various series of the northwestern mutual series fund inc the russell investment funds and the fidelity� vip mid cap portfolio series of fidelity variable insurance products iii as well as any interest in shares of any other fund northwestern mutual may make available from time to time collectively the �funds� shares of each series are valued daily as of the close of trading on the nyse �  � the defined terms used herein are the same as the defined terms in the policy or prospectus unless otherwise defined herein rule ebii  rule ebii provides exemptions from the sections and rule cited above to the extent �necessary for compliance with �� rule e or with insurance laws and regulations and established administrative procedures of the life insurer with respect to issuance transfer and redemption procedures for variable life insurance contracts funded by the separate account including but not limited to premium rate structure and premium processing insurance underwriting standards and the particular benefit afforded by the contract��� the rule thus recognizes that the established procedures of the insurance company itself founded on the requirements of state insurance law have a principal role in defining the requirements which apply for variable life insurance offered by the same company issuance procedures a premium rate structure and insurance underwriting standards  premiums for the policies like premiums for northwestern mutual�s established series of conventional fixed benefit life insurance policies will depend on the age sex and insurance risk classification of the proposed insured as well as the amount of insurance being purchased thus the price of the insurance will differ reflecting established insurance procedures and state law in order to fairly take into account the differences in risks the premiums for a policy will be set forth in the policy itself premiums for policies at illustrative ages and amounts are included in the prospectus the prospectus illustrations like those in the prospectuses for variable life insurance policies offered by northwestern mutual�s competitors are based on premium rates for the best risk classification of nonsmokers which northwestern mutual refers to as premier nt and preferred nt �  �  for the best risk classification of nonsmokers premier nt and preferred nt and the best risk classifications of smokers premier t and preferred t premiums are based on the  commissioner�s standard ordinary smoker and nonsmoker mortality tables for other risk classifications premiums are based on the  commissioner�s standard ordinary mortality table the  cso tables are used notwithstanding the reference to the  commissioner�s standard ordinary mortality table in the definition of �sales load� in rule ec use of  cso tables is required by state law in wisconsin northwestern mutual�s domiciliary state and in other states the cost of insurance is lower under the  cso tables reflecting improvements in longevity since the  cso table was developed use of the  cso table is permitted for contracts filed under rule et  as a mutual life insurance company organized in wisconsin northwestern mutual is also required to offer its insurance contracts as participating policies which share equitably in northwestern mutual�s divisible surplus the policies accordingly have been designed on a participating basis and may pay dividends dividends provide the mechanism whereby the insurance company�s policyholders share in the company�s experience since the pricing assumptions which underlie life insurance policies can be quite conservative actual experience as it emerges is often more favorable than what was assumed the greater part of dividends paid under northwestern mutual�s fixed benefit policies arises from investment rates of return which are greater than the assumed rates of  to  on the policies presently outstanding this investment aspect of dividends does not relate to the policies because the design of a variable life insurance policy provides a direct mechanism for reflection of investment results the other factors for dividends including the dividends for fixed benefit policies are the mortality and expense results while these provide less than onehalf of the dividend amounts for fixed benefit policies they will be the entire source of the dividends paid on the policies �  �  notwithstanding the documented differences between male and female mortality rates a  decision of the us supreme court has created legal liability issues for employers who purchase or are otherwise involved in the purchases of insurance products which are priced so as to reflect these differences similarly the laws of individual states currently only montana require that policies offered there use a sexneutral pricing basis the policies will accordingly be offered on a sexneutral pricing basis for use as required in such situations b procedures for placing a policy in effect  northwestern mutual no longer issues the policy c premium processing for existing policies  the policies are structured as annual premium contracts even though semiannual quarterly and monthly premium frequencies will be available the net annual premium after the deductions described in the prospectus will be placed in the separate account on the policy anniversary each year the policy anniversary will be the anniversary of the policy date the amount of any dividend will be paid annually as of the policy anniversary and placed in the account on that date unless the policy owner has elected to use the dividend other than to either increase policy value or purchase variable paidup additional insurance  because the net annual premium is placed in the account on each policy anniversary regardless of the premium frequency elected and regardless of the timeliness of premium payments so long as the policy does not lapse the actual date on which a scheduled premium is received will not affect the policy�s investment experience northwestern mutual will transfer the net annual premium amount from the general account to the separate account on each policy anniversary receipt of a scheduled premium by northwestern mutual represents a transaction between the policy owner and the general account �  arizona governing committee etc v norris  s ct   �  �  unscheduled additional premiums may be paid at any time prior to the policy anniversary nearest to the insured�s th birthday subject to our administrative practices which may include evidence of insurability and meclimit review any unscheduled premiums less the deduction described in the prospectus will be placed in the separate account as of the date received by northwestern mutual at the home office or a network office if received before the close of trading on the nyse that day if received after the close of trading premiums will be placed in the separate account on the next day  transactions between the separate account and the general account will be effected as of the dates determined in accordance with the terms of the policy but the transactions will not in all cases be physically processed on those dates for example as described below the death of an insured will mark the date on which the policy ceases to participate in the separate account with interest being paid on policy proceeds from that date until the policy is settled but several days may elapse before northwestern mutual received notification because of the timing discrepancies the total assets of the separate account will not always exactly match the sum of the interests in the separate account represented by all of the policies outstanding an accounting routine has been established to reconcile these amounts at least once each year as of december� and the amount of assets in the separate account will be adjusted as required  premiums paid more frequently than annually are increased to �reflect the time value of money at  interest and �cover the administrative costs to process additional payments in some instances in order to ascertain owner instructions northwestern mutual may hold premium amounts under established procedures if transaction instructions are not in good order which may include mec review  northwestern mutual will monitor policies and will attempt to notify an owner on a timely basis if the owner�s policy is in jeopardy of becoming a modified endowment contract mec under the internal revenue code excess premium may be refunded to the owner depending on the instructions received if so instructed by the owner northwestern mutual may hold premium amounts for longer than established procedures �owner� may include an authorized representative of the owner if allowable under applicable law if the owner wants the excess payment applied and the policy to become a mec the date they agree to making the policy a mec is used as the effective date of the excess amount the date northwestern mutual gets the instructions and the payment the money up to the limit is applied as of the original effective date and the balance of the money is applied as of the receipt date of the instructions �  � transfer procedures a transfers  the separate account currently consists of twentyfour divisions corresponding to twentyfour series of the funds each a �portfolio� together the �portfolios� all assets of each division are invested in shares of the corresponding portfolio the policy owner may direct that accumulated amounts under the policy be transferred from one division to another provided accumulated amounts remain in no more than ten divisions at any one time where allowed by state law the policy reserves the right to charge an administrative fee for transfers the amount of the fee will not exceed the corresponding expenses no fee is presently contemplated transfer requests must be in whole percentages and in amounts in greater than  of invested assets when a transfer is made from any division the resulting allocation of invested assets must be in whole percentages in all divisions that have any invested assets as a result of the transfer transfers received by northwestern mutual at its home office before the close of trading on the nyse will receive sameday pricing transfers received by northwestern mutual at its home office after the close of trading will be priced on the next regular trading day b short term and excessive trading  to deter short term and excessive trading northwestern mutual has adopted and implemented policies and procedures which are designed to control abusive trading practices and seeks to apply these policies and procedures uniformly to all policy owners any exceptions must be either expressly permitted by these policies and procedures or subject to an approval process described in them northwestern mutual may also be prevented from uniformly applying these policies and procedures under applicable state or federal law or regulation �  � among the steps northwestern mutual has taken to reduce the frequency and effect of these practices are monitoring trading activity and imposing trading restrictions including with certain exceptions as identified in the prospectus the prohibition of more than twelve transfers or multiple transfers on the same effective date among divisions under a single policy during a policy year further an investor who is identified as having made a transfer in and out of the same division �round trip transfer� in an amount in excess of  within fourteen calendar days will be restricted from making additional transfers after the third such round trip transfer until the next policy anniversary date and sent a letter informing him or her of the restriction thereafter the same investor will be similarly restricted after the second such round trip transfer an investor who is identified as having made one or more round trip transfers within thirty calendar days aggregating more than one percent �of the total assets of the portfolio underlying a division will be sent a warning letter after the first such round trip transfer and will be restricted from making additional transfers until the next policy anniversary date after the second such round trip transfer thereafter the same investor will be similarly restricted after the first such round trip transfer these limitations do not apply to automatic asset transfers scheduled or systematic transactions involving portfolio rebalancing dollar cost averaging and interest sweeps or to initial allocations the use of asset allocation models or changes in future allocations once a policy is restricted northwestern mutual allows one additional transfer into the money market division until the next policy anniversary date these policies and procedures may change from time to time in northwestern mutual�s sole discretion without notice provided however policy owners would be given advance written notice if the policies and procedures were revised to accommodate market timing additionally the funds may have their own policies and procedures described in their prospectuses that are designed to limit or restrict frequent trading such policies and procedures may provide for the imposition of a redemption fee and may require northwestern mutual to provide transaction information to the fund �  � northwestern mutual intends to monitor events and the effectiveness of its policies and procedures in order to identify whether instances of potentially abusive trading practices are occurring however northwestern mutual may not be able to identify all instances of abusive trading practices nor completely eliminate the possibility of such activities and there may be technological limitations on its ability to impose restrictions on the trading practices of policy owners redemption procedures a surrenders partial surrenders and withdrawals for cash value  the policy owner may surrender the policy for the cash value of the policy at any time upon written request during the lifetime of the insured northwestern mutual will determine the cash value for a surrender request on the same day it receives the request if the request is received at the home office before the close of trading on the nyse cash values for surrender requests received by northwestern mutual at its home office after the close of trading will be determined on the next regular trading day  northwestern mutual will generally pay surrender proceeds within seven days of receipt of the owner�s written request except under the circumstances described below in the �deferral of determination and payment� section at the election of the owner and in lieu of direct payment surrender proceeds may be paid under a payment plan the policies set forth the terms and limitations for each plan defines the persons who are entitled to make the selections and receive benefits and refers to procedural rules  when a surrender of a policy is effected northwestern mutual will pay the cash value out of the assets held in the general account an amount equal to the invested assets will be transferred from the separate account to the general account as of the effective date of the surrender �  �  by administrative practice northwestern will permit the policy owner to surrender a part of the policy calculations will be performed as if the policy was split into two policies and one of them was surrendered the policy which continues in force must meet the regular minimum size requirements and will pay premiums based on the reduced amount of insurance  a withdrawal of policy value may be made under certain conditions specified in the prospectus the withdrawal may not be greater than the smaller of �the excess amount less the surrender charge or �an amount which would reduce the maximum loan value to less than any outstanding policy loan the minimum amount for withdrawals is  and no more than four withdrawals may be made in a policy year the policy reserves the right to charge an administrative fee of up to  per withdrawal no fee is presently charged  withdrawals will be made upon written request at the northwestern mutual�s home office the maximum allowable withdrawal will be determined by reference to computations as of the close of business on the day the request is received the check for the amount withdrawn will be mailed from the home office withdrawals from the separate account will generally be paid within seven days of receipt of the owner�s written request except under the circumstances described below in the �deferral of determination and payment� section b payment of death benefit  northwestern mutual will pay the death benefit to the beneficiary or other payee in accordance with the terms of the policy following receipt at the home office of proof of the death of the insured the amount of the death benefit paid will be determined as of the date of death northwestern mutual may transfer invested assets into the money market division of the separate account upon notification of death of the insured until the death benefit is paid in order to minimize breakage payment of the death benefit is subject to the suicide and incontestability provisions of the policy and any applicable state law requirements payment will be made promptly and in any case within seven days after the last of the conditions is met except under circumstances described below in the �deferral of determination and payment� section �  �  the death benefit for a policy on any date when premiums have been timely paid will be equal to the sum of �the minimum guaranteed death benefit of the policy �any additional protection �any excess amount �any variable benefit paidup additions and �the amount of any dividend accumulations and any dividend at death less the amount of any policy loan outstanding the death benefit is adjusted to reflect any premium due if the insured dies during the grace period the death benefit will not be less than the amount of insurance calculated by applying the policy value as a net single premium at the insured�s attained age plus any variable paidup additional insurance and any dividend accumulations and dividend at death less the amount of any policy loan outstanding  northwestern mutual will pay the death benefit for a policy out of assets held in the general account unless the death benefit is paid in a lump sum it will be paid under a payment plan selected by the owner or the beneficiary if the death benefit is paid in a lump sum and the amount meets our criteria northwestern mutual will pay the death benefit by establishing an interestbearing account account information along with a book of drafts that function like a checkbook will be provided when a draft is paid through the bank that administers the account the bank will receive the amount requested from the general account the amount payable will include interest from the date of death an amount equal to the interest of the policy in the separate account as of the date of death will be transferred from the separate account to the general account �  � c lapse and reinstatement  the policy provides a grace period of  days for payment of any premium not paid when due if the premium is paid during the grace period the policy values will not be affected by the delay in paying the premium if the insured dies during the grace period the death proceeds will be reduced by the amount of the unpaid premium as described in the description of the death benefit above  if a periodic premium is not paid within the grace period the policy will lapse unless the owner has the automatic premium loan provision in effect and there is sufficient value to pay the premium due where the premium is less than the maximum amount allowable northwestern mutual will process premiums on the same day it receives the payment if the payment is received at the home office before the close of trading on the nyse payments received by northwestern mutual at its home office after the close of trading will be determined on the next regular trading day if the cash value on the last day of the grace period is at least  the lapsed policy will continue in force as fixed benefit paidup insurance the amount of paidup insurance will be determined by applying the amount of cash value determined as of the last day of the grace period as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured if the cash value is less than  on the last day of the grace period the policy will be treated as surrendered  in lieu of fixed benefit paidup insurance the owner of a lapsed policy may elect a variable benefit paidup insurance if the policy has a cash value of at least  on the last day of the grace period as of the due date of the unpaid premium the policy value is set equal to the cash value including the value of any existing paidup additions plus the amount of any policy loan outstanding any existing variable paidup additional insurance is set at zero the policy loan then remains outstanding the amount of variable paidup additional insurance at any time is determined by applying its cash value plus the amount of any policy loan as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured if the paidup provision goes into effect before the owner has paid the premium due at the beginning of the fifteenth year northwestern mutual will deduct the appropriate surrender charge �  in administering the policies northwestern mutual intends to use a day period instead of  days before the lapse routine is implemented the longer period is used simply to reduce the volume of lapse and reinstatement transactions occasioned by miscalculation when owners attempt to pay the overdue premium on the last day of the grace period the day period is used for northwestern mutual�s fixed benefit insurance policies and will be administered consistently it does not appear in the prospectus for the policies because its purpose would be defeated if policy owners know that the extra time would be allowed when the  days have transpired and the policy lapses the values will be computed as though the policy had lapsed after the grace period of  days notwithstanding the postponement of internal procedures to reflect the fact of a lapse the policy does lapse upon the expiration of the grace period and the death benefit is determined accordingly if the insured dies thereafter regardless of whether the internal procedures have been implemented prior to the date of death �  �  when a policy lapses and fixed benefit paidup insurance goes into effect the policy ceases to have any interest in the separate account an amount equal to the interest of the policy in the separate account determined as of the last day of the grace period will be transferred from the separate account to the general account as of the due date of the unpaid premium  a lapsed policy may be reinstated while the insured is alive within three years longer if required by state law after the premium due date reinstatement is conditional upon evidence of insurability and payment of the greater of �all unpaid minimum premiums plus interest at  or � of the increase in cash value which results from reinstatement plus unpaid premiums with interest at  for any optional riders attached to the policy reinstatement will be effected as of the date when the request is received or any future date requested and investment experience in the separate account will continue from that date northwestern mutual will calculate the cash amount required upon request upon reinstatement the policy date will not change in addition reinstatement the policy will have the cash value death benefit and loan value which it would have had if the policy had not lapsed and if a  rate of investment earnings were credited for the period from the due date of the overdue premium to the date of reinstatement the cash amount required to reinstate a policy will be paid into the general account and the amount required for the separate account reserve will be placed in the separate account as of the reinstatement date any policy loan outstanding with interest thereon must be either repaid or reinstated d reinvestment after surrender or withdrawal  while owners have no right to reinvestment after a surrender or withdrawal northwestern mutual may permit such reinvestments in its sole discretion as described in prospectus owners may make payments in the form of returned surrender or withdrawal proceeds in connection with a request to void a surrender or withdrawal if the request is received by northwestern mutual within a reasonable time after the surrender or withdrawal proceeds are mailed the returned surrender or withdrawal proceeds will be reinvested at the unit value next determined for each division after our receipt of the reinvestment request in good order at the home office including among other things �the return of surrender or withdrawal proceeds �satisfactory evidence of insurability and any �premium payments due proceeds will be applied to the same divisions from which the surrender or withdrawal was made depending on the underwriting classification of the insured northwestern mutual may not accept the reinvestment or may accept the reinvestment with different charges and expenses under the policy northwestern mutual may refuse to process reinvestments where it is not administratively feasible �  � e right to exchange for a fixedbenefit policy  owners may exchange their policies for a life insurance policy that does not vary with the investment experience of the separate account for any reason for two years after the date of issue according to our procedures or as required by state law owners may also exchange for a fixedbenefit policy at any time under certain circumstances if a fund changes its investment adviser or makes a material change to the investment policies of a portfolio f policy loans and loan repayments  the policies provide that the owner may borrow from northwestern mutual using the policy as collateral security the maximum loan value is  of the cash value of the policy if a policy loan is already outstanding these limitations are applied to the amount of cash value which the policy would have if there were no loan  the policy provides that loans will be made upon written request or in certain circumstances by telephone if northwestern mutual receives a request for a loan at the home office on or before the close of trading on the nyse the loan will be effective as of the close of trading that day if the request is received after the close of trading the loan will be effective on the next day the date of the loan will be the date on which the check for the loan proceeds is issued the maximum loan value of the policy will be determined by reference to computations at the close of business the preceding day after the request for the loan was submitted but before processing took place and interest will accrue on the loan from the date of the check when a written loan request is completed by the policy owner the policy owner can elect to have the proceeds sent via check direct deposit to a specified bank account or wire transfer we presently charge a  fee for wire transfer requests �  �  the policy owner may elect an automatic premium loan feature whereby the loan value of the policy will be available to pay any overdue premium the feature may be elected or revoked at any time by written request  interest on a policy loan accrues and is payable on a daily basis unpaid interest is added to the principal the policy will terminate if the cash value of the policy falls to zero but written notice will be mailed to the owner of the policy at least  days before the termination date the notice will state the amount which must be repaid to keep the policy in force  the policy owner may choose between two policy loan interest rates one is a fixed rate of  and the other is a variable rate based on a corporate bond index with an annual adjustment and minimum of  the choice of rates is made on the application form and may be changed as of january� any year upon written request  when a policy loan is affected the loan amount is taken from the divisions of the separate account in proportion to the amounts in the divisions the amounts withdrawn from the separate account are credited with an earnings rate equal to the policy loan interest rate in effect less an amount for expenses including taxes the amount deducted for expenses is disclosed in the prospectus this earnings rate is in lieu of the investment experience of the separate account �  �  loan repayments and accrued interest may be repaid in whole or in part at any time while the insured is alive if payment is received without specific instructions it is applied to any premium due with any remaining amount being applied to any outstanding loans payments in excess of outstanding debt and premiums due will be returned except as described below if payments are received before the close of trading on the nyse northwestern mutual will credit payments as of the date received and transfer them from the general account to the divisions in proportion to the amounts in the divisions as of the same date if payments are received on or after the close of trading on the nyse northwestern mutual will credit payments as of the close of the next regular trading session of the nyse and transfer them from the general account to the divisions in proportion to the amounts in the divisions as of the date northwestern mutual credits the payment�policy loan payments received within  days after the loan interest billing date will be credited as of the loan interest billing date automatic premium loan payments received up to  days after the loan interest billing date will be credited as of the policy anniversary depending on an owner�s premium payment schedule g deferral of determination and payment  northwestern mutual will ordinarily pay policy benefits within seven days after all required documents are received at its home office however we may defer determination and payment of benefits if � � � � the nyse is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or trading on the nyse is restricted as determined by the sec or � � � � the sec permits by an order the postponement of any payment for the protection of owners or � � � � the sec determines that an emergency exists that would make the disposal of securities held in the separate account or the determination of their value not reasonably practicable  when the policy is in force as fixed paidup insurance northwestern mutual may defer paying the cash value for up to six months from the date of surrender if payment is deferred for  days

reputation management at its best northwestern mutual life insurance company is one of the biggest scammers out there today i was a student attending the university of dubuque when i started looking for an internship northwestern mutual was supposedly a highly rated company that had a highly rated internship program my interview consisted of interigating me on every person i knew and they basically wanted me to come in and set up appointments with my friends and family so they could harrass them to buy more insurance i then did further research after my interview and talked to a couple classmates who had participated in their internship program  by the way was amazing how many people this company interviewed with everybody every and i mean every person i talked to said their trainer went in and pushed their friends and family and did hard sales with their horrible insurance programs i was even more shocked when i found out their savings programs inside their insurance policies were even a bigger scam then their so called internship program did you know that when their clients die northwestern mutual keeps their savings account tell me how a savings account at all benefits a client that when they die their family loses it rip off rip off rip off they had no interest in training me and simply wanted to use my name when they called individuals that i knew to sell them

when my husband was diagnosed with cancer and we knew he was terminal one of the things on his bucket list was to take the grandkids to disney world  we had not met them before and this would have been the first time we saw them because my son had moved to colorado from florida  we didnt have the funds for this type of trip so i cashed in my life insurance policy for what it was worth  they did not ask me a thousand questions the rep said it was my money to with what i wanted  we got my sons family to disney and were on our way from key west to orlando to meet them and have a great vacationfamily reunion  my husband didnt make it  half way up he went into crisis and was gone  days later  my husband passed away from kidney cancer caused by cigarette smoking  i was bedside when he passed and was a complete absolute mess  when i called nwm to report his passing the live person i spoke with not a computer was nothing but compassionate patient and knowledgable  they took their time with me and helped me file the final claim  i continue to have a ploicy for my mother and i took out a new policy on myself i know when the time comes this company will not play games with our benificiaries   respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update exemployee responds just to set some myths aside author justtryingtohelp   submitted thursday july   posted thursday july    i had to jump in because of so many misinterprutations  i have worked in financial for years and years and years  interned with nwm and they do a great job of informing their employees on all the benefits of using their products and how great they are  the problem is they never talk about the other options that are out there and what is best for the client  right away they teach you that a whole life policy is the best thing ever and that they have the best one  half true  i think they do have one of the best out there but they only make sense for a small chunk of people  problem is they recommend it to everyone  the interest is not fixed and is based off of the performance of the company  in that aspect all your doing in a while life policy is buying nwm stock and collecting the everchanging dividend without growth of the asset itself  then you take insurance fees out which they will never discuss but are necessary  so at the end of the day take out maybe  if your young and  if your old from your cash value every year so your really earning some fraction of that dividend  now take your loan out from the cash and pay an interest rate on the loan taken from the remaining cash value  again depleting your savings from what i have seen you would have been better off buying a tax free bond or bond fund or just investing regularly if the goal is to save money  use insurance companies for insurance banks for banking accountants for taxes and investment firms for investments  use common sense  would you let an oncologist do neurosurgery or your kidney specialist repair your spine  no  respond to this report whats

was in the intern program too it was great author tim s   submitted saturday january   posted saturday january   i read this report simply because in the late s i was in nmls college agent program the ignorance of this claim against nml was so vast as to be exhausting it is a saturday night and i would much rather be relaxing instead there is this monumentally sad attempt to harm a good company doing a little reading between the lines here i can make a few guesses one i doubt you listened to the training if you did you did not understand it nor care for the discipline involved in being a saver or an agent two you probably found it difficult to make money even if the commissions are what they were then you probably did not make money the tone of the complaint makes it hard for me to imagine that you had the ear of too many people on matters as important as how to save money long term provide needed death benefits or even why savings and investments are completely different animals i have not worked for northwestern mutual for decades but the business lessons and experiences i gained as an intern are invaluable to me even today at this late date i know of five companies i would trust to put my permanent life insurance needs and northwestern mutual and its practices are designed to protect policy holders within the paramenters of providing maximum benefits with maximum dividend performance that is a complex set of responsibilities northwest mutual has my continued respect as do their training programs that i went through tim s respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment northwester mutual response author sjweiss   submitted thursday november   posted thursday november   i read you scathing review about nm and thought to myself what a snivily nosed putz  nms internship program is one of the best of its kind  of the best reps in the company  were college interns that went on to success as a financial advisor with nm  truly huge opportunity  calling on friends and family is a place to start any sales position  depending on the manager that is mentoring the intern would depend on the approach style and subsequently the pressure to buy  regarding the products it is quite obvious that the person i am replying to has no real concept or understanding of how the products actually work  just an education provided by an anti whole life stock broker who will always bash any cash value product as being bad  this is just not true especially in the case of nm  their cash values are  better than the next closest competitor over the pats  years  i am sure the individual who wrote this report went on to a salaried position earning less than  per year with very little growth potential no wonder he is bitter  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment northwest read the fine print redux author curmudgeon   submitted friday october   posted friday october   after filing my initial report i discovered that i had misinterpreted the northwest mutual statement saying that they had deducted  from my account  in reality the statement which is unclear says that the account that replaced my moneymarket account has a penalty for early withdrawal that decreases with time  the k figure is for early withdrawal and is wholly theoretical i dont intend to withdraw from the account early  my apologies for the confusion for the most part i am very satisfied with my experience with northwest mutual respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment nwm read all the fine print author curmudgeon   submitted tuesday october   posted tuesday october   my wife and i went to northwest mutual several years ago to look into longterm care insurance  long story short the representative discovered that we werent satisfied with the performance of our retirement investments and over several months talked us into several things that i now regret  whenever i brought in statements with questions this person insisted that i should simply throw out the statements and leave everything to him  he did a great job of explaining things with powerpoint slides and complex summaries that showed how well our account was doing  but doubts always rose their ugly heads a night or two after a consultation one k investment at nwm turned out to be a moneymarket account that was earning minus per year after all of the fees were deducted  when i challenged the wisdom of this account i was told that as retirees we needed to have conservative investments especially in trying financial times  after insisting that the moneymarket account be closed we were told that nwm would out of the goodness of their heart make a onetime exception to their rules and at my request reinvest the funds in a more risky account something our nwm advisor told us was almost unheard of  since the money was going from one nwm account into another i assumed the change would be free or that any charges would be nominal  our next statement however showed a withdrawal charge of more than   we were neither informed orally nor in writing that such a charge would occur  im sure a withdrawal charge is stated somewhere in the mountains of fine print we received from the company but i havent found it yet  my wife and i dont claim to be well prepared to understand the complexities of modern financial products  however we do expect that our money will be skillfully invested by the professionals of a major financial institution  northwest mutual claims to be a financial services and wealth management company its on their letterhead  i assumed we could trust them to look out for our interests while making a fair return on the money they invest  but this example and others that are too complex to explain here suggest otherwise  if youre in the same boat be sure you ask lots of questions and read everything before signing on the dotted line  im very serious about thatdont sign anything until you fully understand it and have asked lots of questions  if you dont understand it then you should find another company to handle your money respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment ripoffsurvivor author exripoffsurvivor   submitted sunday september   posted sunday september   hello friends i must add my own perspective regarding whole term life insurance there are many empassioned responses defending the honesty and sanctity of whole term life policies and how great northwest mutual is well to this i say rubbish here is why in some aspects whole term life insurance may be a reasonable investment if you truly understand what you are getting into and realized when your net cash value will break even etc however certain representatives eg christopher hahn a bloated clown who was voted best financial rep for  such jilted self serving awards made by vultures for vultures for instance prey upon the financially ignorant  and use very aggressive  even bullshit scare tactics to get their victim to sign up so in essence they are financial predators case closed believe me  this is only my experience some  yrs ago and actually when i woke up was lucky enough to cancel the policy at not such a significant loss i could go on and on about unscrupulous procedural techniques eg isolating the victim not talking to anyone else but you  so as to avoid more experienced questions saying that a decision had to be made within  day as this was a special offer etc etcbut ultimately i would just tell the newbies out there eg just out of academia greener than green when it comes to whole life be aware how much they are asking you to invest really look at the ridiculous premiums paid out compared to term insurance realize opportunity cost of this vs immediate tax advantages of a k and lastly realize how long they will have you put money into a hole hoping some day it will pay out with actually only guaranteeing not even a  return  if that  perhaps just your principal minus fees essentially be prepared that this is a long term investment eg dont expect to even break even until  years or more if you do the math for a yr  policy you will be horrified at the money you put into it vs what you get out lastly while again in less aggressive ways this could make sense in terms of a small policy however i know for a fact that these st suckers aggressively target individuals who are just out of shool or new to the area with little or no experience lastly however it is upto you to be strong because ultimately there is nobody to truly blame but yourself for being talked into something without complete understanding  years later i am so much better off for it that in certain regards i should thank assholes like this for burning me because my knowledge savy and wisdom took off exponentially and now i can retire if i wanted to burn me once great it is how you dust yourself off and learn from mistakes and become all the better good luck people  nobody and everybody who just tries to make their way respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  general comment northwest mutual is drunk on their own koolaid author denverstrings   submitted monday april   posted monday april   i have about  years of experience in the insurancesecurities industry and i truly feel sorry for anyone who does business with northwest mutual their products are horribly priced and generally outdated  dividends sounds great until you realize youre paying literally x as much in premium as you would be in a modern iul plus their sales force are a bunch of sharks and ive had multiple clients tell me about being offered rebates from nw agents if they sign up meaning the agents offered to pay the premiums of the policy for  months which is unethical and illegal their financial ratings are sound largely because they are robbing you on the premiums they charge inevitably this will provoke nw agents to start posting responses about the dividend payouts but the bottom line is when you do the math their whole life policies are screwing you you can get the same taxdeferred growth and even more competitive returns through axa equitables vul or national life group or north americans iul products for  of the premium contribution plus all of the above named companies offer long term care provisions that allow clients to access death benefits in a life policy for ltc purposes trust me if a nw mutual agent offers to buy you lunch so he can introduce you to what he does politely decline their products are a joke and they love to dangle the dividends in front of you but theyre only telling a very small part of the whole story which is that theyll rob you in the process and sell you an outdated product northwest mutual whole life is like buying a nokia brick cell phone in  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment clarification author anonymous  united states of america submitted tuesday december   posted tuesday december   savings accounts  are you talking about whole life insurance cash value  normally theres a selection in the application process whereby the client can select whether or not heshe wants the death benefit plus the cash value for an extra cost in premium  the insurance company figures that you want the greater of the death benefit or the cash value  the death benefit is usually greater  instead of paying the insurance company why not buy term and some perm for the insurance need  term remember pays a claim only  of all policies in force  therefore the perm is useful to pay expenses as its permanent and will be there when your client dies  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment excellent experience with northwestern mutual author bqgetm  united states of america submitted tuesday may   posted tuesday may   im an advertising sales professional  truly appreciate everything that northwestern mutual has done for me with respect to planning my retirement its been incredibly difficult to weed through all of the options that are out there when it comes to retirement my northwestern rep started out in the same internship program youve mentioned in your report but had a very different experience im not sure what sort of a career you plan to go into but if you intend to go into any type of selling job youll need to know how to work your friends  family to your advantage i feel that my whole life policy from northwestern is a great fallback investment in addition to my k roth ira which i can no longer contribute to social security and cash savings i understand that without an extensive knowledge of finances it would be difficult for an intern to see the value of a longterm guaranteed investment such as a whole life insurance policy there are several advantages to it  a whole life policy grows at a guaranteed  interest rate over the term of my policy i will pay in roughly  however at my paidup date it will be worth k  i can withdraw against a whole life policy when im older without paying income tax that makes it better than a savings account and generally speaking better than a k taxfree when you contribute but taxed at normal rates upon withdrawal but slightly worse than a roth ira which is taxed precontribution but taxfree at withdrawal the downside to a roth ira is that you can only contribute up to k annually until you earn a salary of k or greater once you earn that large of a salary your contributions are limited even further and ultimately eliminated at an income of k leaving your only true taxfree at distribution retirement option to be a whole life insurance policy is your post suggesting that northwestern doesnt deserve to earn a profit for helping millions of americans retire comfortably theyre currently one of the highest rated financial services firms in the country and they do it all without public relations  branding advertising youve surely heard of companies like charles schwab td ameritrade bank of americamerrill lynch scottrade etrade ing direct etc  the bottom line is this you should really be investing in nearly every type of retirement investment you possibly can youll almost always be better off just imagine if the millions of folks who were deeply invested in their companys k had been a bit more diversified in  when their retirement plans lost  of their value in the stock market crash if they had even  of their investments secured in whole life insurance policies they wouldnt have been hurt nearly as badly a small very small portion of the job crunch has also been caused by the lack of retirement thats happening in the workplace as a result of these losses see this report from before the recession hit which shows that fewer than half of all americans expect to be able to retire comfortably  this was  months before the market crashed ror redacted and this from more recently november  which points out that employers will have a tough time facilitating the promotion of younger employees who want to get ahead

policy and a northwestern annuity as well in addition to the stocks bonds and collectibles i own i consider my nwm policies to be very valuable assets if you dont think nwm whole life polices are

i have owned four northwestern mutual life insurance policies for many years and my experience with the company has been entirely positive when i bought these insurance policies i did extensive research and ran the numbers this company along with new york life and mass mutual came out on top they pay great dividends and have been doing so for a very long time theyve been in business for over  years they will be paying out  billion in dividends next year the second highest amount in company history and more than the next two highest paying companies combined they are one of only a handful companies with a a rating from am best does that sound like a rip off company selling a garbage product i have had dealings with two of their reps and they have never pushed me to buy anything or given me a hard sell the original reports comments about the savings program being a scam are simply ridiculous and show a basic lack of understanding about how life insurance works respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update exemployee responds northwestern mutual author don  united states of america submitted friday january   posted friday january   to the person who is talking bad about nwm they are so incorrect  every insurance company does this but i have to say that i have friend who work for nwm and they do not push their clients at all  he says their training is great and will always be able to use it if they do not suceed  what i find funny is that everyone really does need life insurance especially if you have a family  its not expensive and well worth it for sure   the savings account is used if they need to borrow from it that is all  it is not a bank  this money is put aside at a low interest rate if they need to borrow it while they are alive  all insurance companies have that program  if you purchase that type of insurance wholie lifepermn life that is how it is with all companies  i worked for allstate and our insurance products are the same  respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  update employee would say that nml is the greatest company on the market today author marty  united states of america submitted tuesday december   posted tuesday december   i have been in the insurance business for over  years from running my own company and to selling to a larger corporation been on the independent side general agent side and now part of nml the first statement is this company in every regards puts the client first you will find out they have their policy holders every year do their own audit of the company and their practices name another company allowing this today to my knowledge their is no top  company doing it next take their conservative stance to underwriting and you will see in their large dividend pay outs to policy holders a large portion comes from great underwriting now as a representative this can be frustrating when you have a president or key employee you want to insure and the company will not insure them due to medical issues but it is in the policy holders best interest to only take risk in their best interest  the policy holderowners of the company do come first yes owners a mutual company is owned by the policy holders they do not have to show the big profits to share holders but only to the ownerspolicy holders the company will also not tolerate representatives that due not follow their strict guide lines of professional representation i have seen them fire a large producer for not following the rules as defined by them their are no exceptions to these rules in other companies i have seen the old saying of production hides the sins not here if you do not keep records of your sales in a compliant manner and do what is best for the client you will be looking for a job    as a old time representative it was hard for me to do all their required education and record keeping but now after a short time it has paid off if a client questions something i can go into our system and show them my dictations of the meeting and most of the time back it up with letters or emails explaining what we did an why so you can teach an old dog new trick     our system is set up like a doctors would operate when we see a client we find their needs and desires for their future and their families goals  dreams we explore the what ifs that are so hard for most people to talk about unless someone like myself comes to them as an advocate for their kids or spouse in a role as the advocate we are the voice for the ones with out one we are the ones that help a person provide for their family for the unexpected things in life no one expects to die early or become disabled when it does happen they are always blessed when they did the responsible thing and took care of their family for those issues yes i said responsible because it is our job to provide for our family in those times of need when we have a child and do not take out disability or life insurance on our life it is a disservice as a parent almost child abuse at times would you want your child in foster care because you did not have life insurance when you and your spouse died before your time i know with my family and friends it would be hard to see their family suffer because i did not do my job and ask the hard questions you insure your house so why would you not insure your families most important asset you    in closing i will say that if you do not care for your family and friends then stay the path of not doing the responsible thing and sharing the need of life insurance and disability insurance with them this is a selfless act to provide for your families needs at a premature death or disability in looking at companies you will not find a better company financially or ethically this is coming from a guy that has been around for many years in this business also from my personal life and seeing it pay off when a family member died a early death the money was their for the funeral and other cost needed it was there because i asked the hard question and showed the need and provided the solution these risk based products are a need for almost every individual but like other things in this country today we do not always do the responsible things to many people live for today and let others worry when their dead i have never had a widow say would you give me my savings part of the death benefits and you can keep the balance some people may pay a few hundred dollars in the so called savings part of their life insurance contract but receive millions back in the death benefit portion in some cases the savings part is completed with the disability waiver added to the policy so my question to you is are you going to be responsible and take care of your family and purchase the needed death and disability benefits or will you allow the state or government to provide for your family if you die or become a disabled if something happens to my family and friends i do not want to tell their children i did not do my job no i want to be able to say your parents loved you enough to do the right thing an protect you even if they were not here to do so them selves    if you need information on companies strength review the rating agencies of insurance companies if you need to make the correct financial decisions find a reputable insurance professional you can do back ground checks with most department of insurances and finra for

insider information on this company  consumer comment rebuttal to northwestern mutual scam claimers author bigfoost  united states of america submitted wednesday december   posted wednesday december   first and foremost northwestern mutual does interview a lot of candidates especially for their internship program  i was part of that process when i started as an intern in january   lets look at this point first  northwestern has the reputation as the quiet company meaning that they dont spend a lot of their money on advertising in mass media  while this is changing now it is a great point for policy holders because the company is not spending its reserve funds on needless advertising  with that point in mind how many college students do you think have heard of northwestern mutual by actively seeking out insurance and investment advice or by seeing their commercials on tv  ill go out on a limb and say not a whole lot so for northwestern to bring new blood into the company they have to actively recruit competent talent  where to find these individuals with work ethic smarts and a drive to succeed thats right on college campuses  so yes they have to go out see people and find those with a passion to serve othersnumber two the hard sale of insurance products  the company culture of northwestern is not to sell anyone  it is to identify a need and make recommendations for that need  during the process of helping individuals build financial security there are many aspects a financial representative needs to cover  these areas include saving investing debt reduction and protecting a family with insurance products  out of these areas which do you think a college student could be competent enough to explain investment products or insurance coverage  in my opinion it is far easier to learn the basics of insurance than investment strategies risks and returns for savvy investors  not to mention that it would take much to long and no student would even try to obtain securities licenses for an internship  so we are left with interns getting a license for life insurance which is still part of a comprehensive financial plan and much easier to put into place than investmentsthe third point of northwestern keeping the cash value of a policy holder that dies is easy to rebut  yes they keep the cash value  thats right i said that they do indeed keep the cash value  but thats because the surviving family receives the death benefit  so now its time for an example  say john bought a  whole life permanent insurance policy  years ago  hypothetically the cash in the policy is  and the face value death benefit has gone up to  anyone with working knowledge of permanent insurance knows that cash value increases as well as the death benefit barring any tweeks made by the policy owner that would keep these at a level amount  john has lived a long life and passes leaving the  death benefit to his family  northwestern keeps the  in cash value and premiums paid in  if you could explain how getting k is better than getting the cash of k is better please go ahead  now some would say why dont they get both  i would say to that how in the world would a company stay in business if it paid the death claim and all cash in the policy  there would be no way to sustain the company if the only payment they ever got was premium  last no one who uses the policy exclusively for the death benefit is concerned with the savings aspect  younger people will like the savings aspect and can use the cash throughout their lifetime and should do so based on their specific goals  if the savings is a rip off please show me another asset that draws a  return current northwestern dividend on a tax deferred basis with no early withdrawal penalty  it cant be found  but to get interesting lets try  savings account  hahahaha if youre lucky a  return  congratulations you lost out to inflation  cds  again  return taxed  still losing to inflation  bond portfolio  in this day in age still at  with junk bonds taxed so that the real return is below  and if it is inside iras there are early withdrawal penalties  iras and k  great place for long term saving  they will get you the best returns with the right asset allocation but if you want that money before you are  you will pay taxes and penalties  so you tell me what asset gives you great return defers taxes and has many options to use the money tax free and is accessible to you at any time you got itlife insurance through northwestern mutualnow as far as them contacting family and friends who else would you know to contact and have such an important conversation with  yes thats right you would have rather called on executives partners in law firms engineers etc because they would have certainly taken a college student seriously  you have to start in your natural market let them see the value you bring and then be referred out to other individuals  there shouldnt be a problem talking with your family and in fact those should be the most important conversations you have  consider your family not having the right amount of life coverage or none at all  most likely a premature death would devastate the family be it a parent child or primary wage earner  i can say from experience that  of the people i have talked with dont have adequate coverage based on what they would want to have covered if they passed prematurely  if you didnt talk with them about life insurance no one probably ever would which would be a sad tragedy  talk with a few financial reps financial advisors or even friends and family members and see if you cant come up with some stories of families or individuals devastated by a lack of life coverage  it is just as important if not more than the investing part  if you can come up with someone who has never heard of or known a person affected by losing a loved one too soon then you can bash life insurance all you like  but i will venture that you cant find someone like thatin closing life insurance is vital no matter who you get it through  but if you are going to purchase something so important why not go through the best company  by best i am pointing to northwestern mutual who has the strongest financial ratings across the board with a positive future outlook  they are in fact the only insurance company with those ratings and one of only a handful of any type of company in the world with those ratings  so it makes sense why they are so beloved even when there is misunderstood slander put out by people on sites like these  for those that would like to rebut the ratings feel free to look at the four large ratings firms and see where northwestern ranks  new york life will claim the strongest ratings also but they have a negative outlook which indicates they will soon be downgraded leaving northwestern alone at the top respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either
