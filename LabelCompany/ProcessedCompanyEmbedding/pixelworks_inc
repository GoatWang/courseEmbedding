apple revenue stream pixelworks may be mentioned in apples upcoming product release as the producer of an integral component in one of its new devicesthe iris chip is a ground breaking component bringing high definition to mobile and is going into mass productionpixelworks is undervalued relative to peers and should be trading at about  per share prior to the upcoming apple announcementa  million shelf registration has been filed and could be used for a huge product ramp up for a client like applebackground pixelworks inc nasdaqpxlw designs and produces semiconductors for digital video display in mobile devices televisions and projectors pixelworks varying product lines show great diversity and promise for a small cap company their large contracts with industry leading clientele show that they are building exceptional demand in the marketplace irisbringing hd to mobile devices pixelworks has developed the first high definition video processor for mobile applications this device can be implemented in devices such as smartphones tablets and ultrabooks the iris chip will deliver superior performance to all current offerings the iris chip is able to offload the cpu and gpu to free up system resources and conserve battery life according to testing the pixelworks chip could save as much as  of power usage pixelworks has said that iris has been sampled by customers since june and may already be in mass production source eetimescom the apple connection news first came out on march   in the k that over  of pxlws revenues came from apple nasdaqaapl on august   in the companys most recent q it was disclosed that apple accounted for  of pixelworks revenues there are many different applications that would be advantageous for both players at the current time it is unknown why pixelworks is receiving this revenue from apple new board member with deep connections to apple on april   pixelworks brought david tupman on to the board of directors tupman was a vice president in apples hardware engineering division prior to becoming the ceo at details lab inc tupman led the hardware and technology teams for both the iphone and the ipod until  we believe that this connection will facilitate a longterm relationship between apple and pixelworks what will pixelworks do for apple source appleinsidercom we see three different ways that pixelworks could integrate with future apple products all three of these hypotheses will improve apples current line and provide immeasurable revenue growth for pixelworks while none of these conjectures have been announced these are the three viable reasons for the revenue that pixelworks is receiving from apple iris video processor in iphone andor ipad iris would integrate perfectly with apples soon to be announced iphone  and ipad it only stands to reason that being a market leader apple would be the first to offer high definition video viewing on their mobile devices we also firmly believe that if the iris chip goes into one of these devices it will go in both the development timeline of the iris chip also seems to match up well with the release of these devices pixelworks is building out the apple tv since the rumors of apple tv began to circulate pixelworks has generated  of their revenue from apple this would explain the developmental stages of this new product using pxlw processors in the conference call from the last earnings report on july   the ceo bruce walicek telegraphs that they have developed a mass production version of large screen for a partner apple for projected and panel large screen display applications we continued to ship volume production of the pa during the quarter which includes our patented halo free technology and tackles the most demanding video quality problems in monitors and ultrahd tvs and during the quarter we began shipping the mass production version of the advanced soc for large screen applications we developed under our codevelopment partnership this is a significant milestone on this project and we expect to ramp production in the second half of  and beyond source seekingalphacom pixelworks is building a projector for the iphone  it has been rumored that the iphone  will have a projection device feature with pixelworks expertise in both mobile processors and projection displays they are a logical producer of this device this device could be an option or an additional feature to the iphone so its impact will not be known until it is released source idesigntimescom  million shelf registration on august   pxlw filed a form s for a  million shelf registration we see this as both a risk and an opportunity the primary risk involved with this registration is that it gives pxlw the ability to dilute the shares if they chose to however based on a current financial analysis of pxlw we do not see the need for them to dilute unless there is an extremely large order in the pipeline the dilution may lead to a decline in share price on the contrary we feel that the dilution will not come without some large announcement that would greatly counteract this dilution to the upside we believe that this shelf registration is pointing to a direct ramp up of a large order from apple peer analysis we feel that pxlw is currently undervalued against it peers even without a large event from apple on tuesday pxlw is trading at a discount quicklogic corporation nasdaqquik is the most comparable company in the industry to pxlw quik is of similar market cap as pxlw and designs and builds semiconductors for tablets and smartphones based on multiple metrics quik is trading at an unjustified premium to pxlw source rightedge analytics based on our valuation and growth measures we believe that pxlw is worth about  per share as it stands these estimates are based on pixelworks current business without factoring in the large apple event we expect to take place in the coming days source rightedge analytics conclusion at its current share price pixelworks is trading at a great discount before factoring in any potential apple relationships pxlw has a price target of  per share because we feel that the applepixelworks relationship is in the early stages pixelworks has an unlimited upside pixelworks is a stock to buy ahead of apples product release on september th disclosure the author is long pxlw
