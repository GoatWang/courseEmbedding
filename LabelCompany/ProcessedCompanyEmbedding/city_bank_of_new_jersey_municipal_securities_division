rap sheet  corporate research project skip to main content search search citigroup corporate rap sheet citigroup by philip mattera the financial octopus known as citigroup is the result of the marriage of one of the country’s oldest and most powerful commercial banks citibank and a conglomerate travelers group created by sanford weill to promote and exploit the weakening of federal rules governing the financial sector during the  credit crisis a struggling citigroup had to be bailed out by the federal government which ignored calls for its breakup and aside from some multimilliondollar regulatory settlements did little to curb its aggressive practices in  it pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of currency market manipulation but was allowed to continue business as usual   standard oil roots citibank whose roots went back to the early th century later developed close ties to the rockefeller interests and became the prime bank of the standard oil empire by the early th century what was still called national city bank was testing the limits of federal bank regulations using a holding company it began to acquire control of other banks around the country—until an uproar over this creation of a “money trust” caused it to abandon the plan taking advantage of the  mcfadden act which allowed national banks to open branches in their home town national city later began building an extensive retail banking presence in new york city during the s citi and the other big banks based in the new york city pressured the municipal government to adopt harsh austerity policies to deal with a fiscal crisis the banks had helped bring about that crisis by dumping their holdings of the city’s securities and refusing to underwrite new issues citibank was singled out in this regard in  municipal unions organized the withdrawal of more than  million in institutional deposits from the bank undeterred citi and the other banks supported the creation of undemocratic bodies such as the municipal assistance corporation and the emergency financial control board to protect their interests citibank also made life more difficult for new yorkers by raising interest rates on consumer loans to more than  percent in  citi paid  to settle usury charges brought by the new york state attorney general in the s citibank was also an aggressive proponent of using the vast new deposits coming in from oilproducing countries to lend aggressively to “underdeveloped” nations this recycling of petrodollars created unsustainable levels of debt for much of the third world which later came back to haunt citibank and other western institutions in  citibank had to add  billion to its loan loss reserves to deal with these bad loans even so the third world debt problem kept citi unstable to the point that there was speculation it might file for bankruptcy or enter into a merger to prop up its weak balance sheet in  citi got a  million capital infusion from saudi prince alwaleed bin talal and another  million from the sale of preferred stock to a group of several dozen institutional investors an august   article in financial world entitled “too big to fail” described citi as “a deeply troubled institution” until it changed its policy in  citi was the largest us lender to the apartheid government of south africa yet it continued to provide extensive loans to the south african private sector defying calls for divestment this was a key reason citi was one of the companies targeted by a group called americans concerned about corporate power in  the group founded by ralph nader and other public interest activists launched citiwatch to monitor the bank’s practices with regard to employee rights community reinvestment pension investments and loans to repressive governments in  the us securities and exchange commission overruled its staff and closed a threeyear investigation of citibank’s foreign currency transactions without pressing charges it later came to light that one of the sec commissioners who made that decision had previously represented the bank while working for a prominent law firm that had long represented citi an investigation by a house of representatives subcommittee presented evidence of extensive violations of banking laws and tax evasion by citibank’s foreign subsidiaries citibank took advantage of the savings  loan crisis of the s to acquire failing thrifts such as fidelity savings of san francisco and thus lay the foundation of interstate banking as citi moved into more states it also became the target of more criticism a  report by citizen action alleged that citi’s home mortgage computer system was overcharging home buyers in  states  a  report by the comptroller of the currency found that citi’s home mortgage business engaged in sloppy practices that exposed the company to excessive risk while also overcharging many customers   the creation of citigroup citibank’s struggle to survive on its own came to an end in  when it agreed to the merger with travelers which sandy weill had fashioned out of his takeover of the insurance company by that name as well as the investment houses shearson and salomon brothers the latter had paid  million to settle charges that it submitted fraudulent bids in treasury department auctions of federal securities to circumvent limits on the portion of those issues that a single firm was allowed to purchase the  billion merger flew in the face of federal rules barring the combination of commercial banking and either insurance or investment banking yet weill and citibank ceo john reed correctly bet that federal regulators would find the deal too big to block citigroup thus came into being one of citigroup’s first big challenges was to deal with accusations that citibank had assisted in laundering nearly  million in payoffs received from drug traffickers by raul salinas de gortari the brother of mexico’s president a report by the us general accounting office found that citibank violated its own policies in the matter turning a blind eye to suspicious transactions in  testimony to a congressional committee reed admitted that citibank had been slow to correct years of weak controls on wealthy customers another gao report in  found that citi had failed to follow federal guidelines to prevent money laundering and had allowed up to  million in suspicious russian funds to pass through  accounts and in further congressional testimony in  citi officials admitted serious deficiencies in dealing with two offshore caribbean banks implicated in

institutions as a new york times investigation found the bank had been particularly reckless in loading up on the subprime mortgagerelated securities that were now deemed toxic citi was slated to receive an infusion of  billion from the troubled assets relief program tarp but its condition turned out to be so precarious that in november  the federal government announced that it would protect citi against potential losses on its  billion pool of toxic assets and provide an additional  billion infusion as washington post columnist steven pearlstein pointed out “of all the rescues mounted by the government this year none carries with it more symbolism or more irony than that of citigroup” which of course had done so much to break down federal restrictions on the financial sector for a while it looked like citi might be broken up under pressure from the federal government it spun off its smith barney retail brokerage business into a joint venture with morgan stanley there was even

by the federal judge jed rakoff who was overseeing the case judge rakoff also challenged the sec’s willingness to let citi get off without admitting guilt in the matter calling the deal “neither
