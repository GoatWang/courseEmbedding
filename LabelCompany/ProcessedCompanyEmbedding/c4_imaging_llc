welcome to c imaging home prostate brachytherapy novel mri technology company news contact c imaging develops innovative medical devices that enable clinicians to personalize patient treatment through accurate imageguided procedures the company’s core proprietary technology c is a unique magnetic resonance imaging mri agent that has been encapsulated within an implantable biocompatible shell c

prostate brachytherapy  c imaging home prostate brachytherapy novel mri technology company news contact prostate brachytherapy brachytherapy is a clinical standard for prostate cancer treatment brachytherapy or radioactive seed implantation is a standard option for the curative treatment of prostate cancer brachytherapy involves implanting around  radioactive seeds directly into the prostate its popularity has increased due to its effectiveness convenience relatively low incidence of erectile dysfunction and minimal invasiveness  radiation released from the seeds penetrates the surrounding prostate tissue at a distance of  mm with most of the radiation concentrated within the prostate outcomes after brachytherapy can be excellent but depend greatly on the quality of the implant year prostatespecific antigen psa relapsefree survival rates of  for highquality implants vs  for lowquality ones have been reported  mri is the ideal imaging option for assessing prostate anatomy and seed placement the inability of standard imaging options ultrasound computed tomography ct fluoroscopy to clearly visualize soft tissue complicates accurate assessment of the radiation dose delivered by implanted seeds prostate edge detection is very poor on ct images which can result in a high degree of interobserver variability in prostate contouring and hence in implant quality evaluation a study estimating prostate gland volumes and subsequent quantifiers of implant adequacy highlighted the significant interobserver differences when using postimplant ct scans these variations led to significant differences in dose volume histograms dvh according to the individual reviewers  the efficacy of mri for evaluating soft tissues after seed implantation has been well described  the internal and external urinary sphincters in particular cannot be adequately identified with ct imaging but they are well visualized with mri however the use of mri in prostate brachytherapy has been limited by the inability to accurately identify the seeds all implanted seeds have the radioactive element encased within a paramagnetic titanium shell which appears under mri as a signal void that cannot be easily distinguished from needle tracks or blood vessels moreover seeds in vascularized regions or periprostatic tissue can also be difficult to identify in brachytherapy where mmlevel precision is necessary to limit excessive radiation dose “hotspots” within normal tissue and to prevent poor radiation coverage “cold spots” of the prostate  it is unlikely that adequate seed separation can be achieved with mri detection of seeds alone the development of a positivesignal mri marker to aid in seed detection and localization could be an advance for prostate brachytherapy with the potential to improve the quality of implants clinicians could have more confidence in the quality of treatment delivered and supplemental seeds could be implanted immediately if needed in addition effective management strategies could be immediately employed if regions are known to have inadvertently receive an excess dose the superior image quality of mri could improve the accuracy of prostate contouring allow detailed appreciation of adjacent critical organs and reveal the true relationship of the implanted seeds to the prostate and critical

posttreatment assessment the sirius™ mri marker consists of a sealed biocompatible polymer capsule containing c a unique mri agent the length of each capsule is  mm and the diameter is  mm the sirius™
