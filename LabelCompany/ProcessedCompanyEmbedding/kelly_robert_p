robert kelly inside the fall of a superstar banker by katie benner and shawn tully november    am et two years ago the bank of new york mellon ceo almost left to run bank of america but he changed his mind and the board welcomed him back thats when the trouble started fortune  when robert kelly walked into the white house that monday morning he had every reason to be on edge it was dec   and the ceo of bank of new york mellon was one of an elite group of bankers who had been summoned by president obama at the time kelly was deep in negotiations to leave his post at bny mellon the eighthbiggest us bank by assets and take the top job at the industrys largest institution bank of america the previous tuesday hed told the bny mellon board at a breakfast in boston that bank of america wants me for the job and that he planned to take it the  am meeting with the president was held in the windowless roosevelt room just steps from the oval office kelly and fellow ceos including john stumpf of wells fargo wfc fortune  and jamie dimon of jp morgan chase jpm fortune  found seats at the table next to officials such as white house economic adviser christina romer and treasury secretary timothy geithner when the meeting came to order president obama delivered a stern message he urged the bankers to revive lending to small businesses and lectured them about wall street pay the federal government the president stressed had rescued the banks during the financial crisis and it was beyond any notion of common sense  a virtual insult in fact  for their top brass to pocket gigantic pay packages after the american taxpayer had bailed them out comment ironically kelly had for days been pushing for precisely the kind of exorbitant pay from bank of america bac fortune  that president obama was condemning the week before bofa had fully repaid its  billion from the troubled asset relief program officially freeing itself from tarps draconian restrictions on compensation over the next three days the bofa search committee hammered out a draft contract with kelly that included an upfront payment of more than  million and guaranteed another  million to  million a year the committee even agreed to kellys demand that bofa move its headquarters from charlotte to new york city where kelly owns a sumptuous townhouse but over the weekend the bofa directors had begun fretting about what they should have foreseen before offering kelly such a sweet deal a populist uproar on capitol hill the instant the news broke if kelly needed more evidence that his dream package was endangered the presidents harsh words in the roosevelt room that monday seemed to seal its fate he must have realized that his chances of securing perhaps the biggest job in banking were fading fast incredibly kelly still had a few hours to save his highly lucrative ceo post at bny mellon bny  even though this wasnt the first but the second time in just two months hed flirted with bofa the bny mellon board had scheduled a meeting at  pm to announce kellys departure and had the press release ready to go so kelly raced back from the white house to new york to save his job he called lead director wesley von schack from reagan national airport and declared i want to stay around  pm he arrived in a conference room at bnys headquarters at  wall st where von schack was talking to the other directors on speakerphone von schack a retired ceo of utility energy east invited kelly to speak the ceo was now practically begging for his job from the same directors hed brushed off a week before i dont like the way bofa has handled this process he explained i wouldnt have a good working relationship with the directors he apologized for his actions and added this is where i want to be the bny mellon directors spent some time deliberating  and took kelly back it was a fateful and misguided decision in retrospect it would have been far better if the board had forced him to go ahead with his resignation that afternoon because from that point on the relationship with his lieutenants the directors and especially von schack was poisoned the surreal events of that day marked the start of a downward spiral of distrust at bny mellon that less than two years later would end in kellys forced resignation  this time for real  on aug  of this year the press release that day contained a singlesentence explanation for kellys exit robert p kelly has stepped down due to differences in approach to managing the company kellys departure  the sudden shocking resignation of a star ceo  has received remarkably little attention or explanation today bny mellon stands in the spotlight primarily as the target of two major legal battles first the us department of justice and a handful of state attorneys general are seeking more than  billion in damages from bny charging that the bank cheated customers in foreignexchange transactions  alleged practices that long predate kelly for more on those charges see box second bny serving as trustee endorsed an  billion agreement between bofa and investors that bought bofas toxic mortgages  and now its being sued by the new york attorney generals office saying that bny failed in its duty as trustee of the mortgagebacked securities    protesters want more from bank of america but now for the first time the full story of kellys fall from grace can be told fortune assembled the dramatic narrative from interviews with dozens of sources almost none of whom spoke for attribution but whose accounts could be confirmed by others the tale chronicles a total mismatch between the personality and skills of a ceo and the challenges and culture of the company he was running robert kelly  can be a charming leader with a sophisticated financial mind his history shows that hes always looking for the next new thing  a grander job more money and more excitement kelly who declined to be interviewed for this story is a bigpicture thinker with an artistic creative temperament who relishes business as an adventure his weakness is a surfeit of selfconfidence bordering on hubris bny mellon couldnt have been a worse fit for kelly with  billion in  revenue bny mellon rankedno  in this years fortune   the thlargest commercial bank on the list but its a highly conservative oldline institution that specializes in mundane grinditout businesses and prizes tradition selfeffacement and loyalty it is a major player in asset management but its signature franchise where it ranks no  globally is asset servicing  the business of performing record keeping securities lending and backoffice tasks for investment funds and financial institutions thats anything but glamorous and its not bob kelly the story of bob kellys downfall isnt primarily about bnys financial performance which was middling but hardly disastrous its chiefly a classic study in a dysfunctional relationship between a boss and a board even after pleading to keep his job he bristled at taking orders from the directors who took him back he kept going his own way making decision after decision without consulting the board  everything from exploring options for a new headquarters to a surprise plan to shrink the workforce and veteran directors never got over what they viewed as an act of disloyalty that fateful week in december genteel was not bobs style a canadian by birth robert kelly grew up in the scenic atlantic port city of halifax in nova scotia where his father worked as a tax accountant canadians like to compare nova scotia to americas midwest both have a culture that encourages affability and plainspokenness  qualities that his friends say kelly shares notably an unadorned bluntness after graduating from saint marys university in halifax with a degree in accounting kelly joined kpmg and quickly discovered a way to win new clients in  he bought one of the first desktop computers the radio shack trs he learned to program the machine and showed small businesses how to reap major savings by keeping their books electronically in  kelly joined torontodominion bank td in its information technology department moving to london soon after kelly wrote pioneering programs that quickly valued the interest rate and currency derivatives that were just gaining favor in europe giving tds traders an edge that brought big profits he became cfo in  at age  bob was highly analytical a great salesman and he even made business fun recalls stephen mcdonald a former colleague at td and now coceo of investment bank scotia capital it was clear he was a top candidate to be ceo and wanted the job but kelly lost his opportunity when td acquired canada trust financial and named its ceo w edmund clark as heir apparent in  kelly joined first union in charlotte  soon to be renamed wachovia  as cfo first union was undergoing a painful restructuring following years of whirlwind expansion that had turned reckless with the disastrous acquisitions of corestates and the money store in the northeast kelly brought a relentless disciplined approach to measuring which businesses and acquisitions provided the best returns and ensuring that the bank allocated its capital to those areas during his tenure as cfo from  to early  wachovia delivered shareholders a total return of  handily beating both the bank index and the sp  spx for two straight years  and  the analysts polled by institutional investor voted bob kelly the best cfo of a large bank in america one of the great mysteries of the kelly saga is that a leader so well liked at wachovia would rouse so much illfeeling from his coworkers and his board just a few years later at bny mellon but in retrospect its also remarkable that at wachovia kelly fared so well in a courtly culture at odds with his own curt style it was a civil southern place and that wasnt bob recalls thomas wurtz who served as treasurer under kelly bob was honest and direct kelly sparred frequently with ceo ken thompson who wanted to make wachovia a big player in capital markets a business kelly disliked i dont see it that way hed tell his superiors in meetings showing resistance practically unheardof at the bank genteel was not bobs style says gregory thompson a former financial executive at wachovia he wouldnt be offensive but hed dig his heels in bny mellons cast of characters kellys coworkers at wachovia found him a downtoearth fascinating colleague with a zany side bob had this boisterous laugh you could hear across the floor recalls former general counsel mark treanor his colleagues still marvel over his mathematical abstract drawings often in meetings hed do penandink caricatures of the folks in the room on a big pad while they discussed loan reserves or foreignexchange hedging then get smiles when he showed them their likenesses one year kelly held a christmas party at his home with a professional caricaturist on hand to draw the guests at the evenings end kelly turned the easel around and made a quick sketch of the caricaturist that at least equaled the experts work the doodling seemed to give him a freedom of thought so that his brain could roam freely so that he was unbounded by pure logic says gregory thompson who describes kelly as a d thinker a history buff kelly festooned his office with photos of winston churchill and orville wright as well as a seventh edition of adam smiths the wealth of nations from  purchased on ebay kelly craved the limelight he adored for example giving witty speeches explaining wachovias strategy to employees at call centers but according to wachovia veterans kelly also wanted to be the public face of wachovia and chafed that ken thompson not bob kelly played the main part in telling the wachovia story to wall street a friend of kellys who considers him a terrific banker explains why kelly can be either enthralling or irksome depending on the audience bob is used to being the smartest guy in the room he says he presents his ideas like theyre amazing the people wowed by him love it they feel lucky to be throwing ideas around with a guy that smart but for those not wowed by his ideas or who have a different view says the friend he comes across as offputting arrogant and sometimes rude    big fat banker bonuses unbelievable because he was around the same age as thompson kellys prospects of ever becoming ceo of wachovia looked dim but he had suitors in  the board of mellon financial decided that kelly was just the change agent it needed to revive the fabled institution then under extreme pressure from activist hedge funds and kellys biggest champion on the mellon board was a flinty retired utility executive  none other than wesley von schack kelly was announced as ceo of mellon in february  it didnt take kelly long to make a transformative move in early december after just  months at mellon kelly announced a major deal  a merger with bank of new york to kelly the union made great business sense bny was powerful in asset servicing but underweight in asset management for mellon the mix was the reverse it boasted a major investment franchise and a puny presence in custody a few bny directors worried that in their interviews with kelly he was in the all about me mode incessantly talking about his accomplishments still the two boards determined that bnys chief thomas renyi would remain as chairman but step down as ceo kelly would take charge running a business three times the size of the former mellon kelly the performer didnt hesitate to sketch a fantastic picture of the union on dec   in a webcast to analysts kelly predicted that the combined bny mellon would begin by posting  billion in aftertax earnings and grow rapidly from there but the bank wouldnt come close to delivering on those promises it took until  to reach the  billion profit goal a big reason for that of course was that the bottom dropped out of the economy not long after the merger but eventually the board came to perceive kelly as lacking sufficient desire to cultivate clients or the will to control escalating costs at the outset though the two companies appeared to meld extremely well they boasted two of the longest proudest histories in the annals of american business bank of new york was the oldest financial institution in america founded by alexander hamilton in  family patriarch thomas mellon had launched his bank in  a key difference bank of new york was renowned for frugality bordering on outright cheapness in the s dozens of analysts would stand in line waiting to use a handful of bloomberg terminals managers would sometimes forgo raises and bonuses for as long as two years if costs got too high the two boards merged smoothly for the most part the directors were ceos or retired ceos of mediumsized to fairly big companies often from the midwest and they shared a you work for us attitude toward management notably one current director and mellon board holdover is john surma ceo of us steel who as a trustee of penn state this november was the person who announced that legendary football coach joe paterno had been fired the board bonded quickly says frank biondi a former chairman of viacom via who left the board in  it didnt have highprofile people but it was a smart capable group the directors assisted kelly by creating an integration task force reporting directly to the board which over time created  billion in cost savings by closing offices reducing staff and merging systems kelly had barely settled in to his new office in new york when he faced his first major test the financial crisis struck in mid pounding assetmanagement fees as bond and stock prices plummeted to the board kellys leadership through the crisis looked sound bny took far smaller losses than most other banks and paid back its tarp money earlier by late  the stock had rebounded to  from a low of  kelly was playing a major role in several industry groups including the prestigious financial services roundtable and was highly respected in washington as a counselor to the administration on regulatory matters at the time his public role appealed to the directors over breakfast the day of each board meeting kelly would keep the directors informed on what bny could expect from regulatory reform in washington his role as ambassador was also good business bny mellon won the exclusive contract from the treasury department to handle all of the bookkeeping accounting and distressedasset auctions for tarp in return the board gave its ceo the royal treatment the compensation committee headed by von schack modeled kellys compensation after that of highly paid ceos of extremely large companies  mostly a lot larger than bny mellon  including jp morgan blackrock blk fortune  citigroup c fortune  and wells fargo from  to  kelly earned on average  million a year making him one of americas highestpaid ceos financial or otherwise the directors believed kelly was leading bny to the big time outside the office kelly enjoyed a lifestyle worthy of a wall street titan in  he paid  million for a fivestory squarefoot townhouse on manhattans upper east side nine blocks from the stately former mellon family mansion the house was meticulously renovated in the mackintosh architectural style inspired by the british artsandcrafts school the library shelving was carved from a single walnut tree a folkart canadian mountie doll was placed in the parlor floor window as if to stand guard kellys flirtation with bofa the crack that would weaken then destroy the bonds of trust between kelly and the board opened when kelly began his onagain offagain dance with bank of america in late october  kelly started negotiations with bofa  without telling his board from the start any agreement faced a stiff obstacle it would cost bofa well over  million to buy out kellys package of stock and retirement benefits at bny mellon kelly wanted a chance to run the nations biggest bank but he didnt want to give up his lucrative compensation to do so bofa was still under the tarp rules so the treasury department could veto a pay deal it considered excessive members of the compensation committee tried negotiating with kenneth feinberg at the time the obama administrations executivecompensation czar but feinberg adamantly opposed any large buyout saying that it was totally inappropriate for a company taking government money and it would never happen on his watch as it turned out feinbergs objections werent the deal killer on nov  kelly members of the search committee and assorted lawyers and headhunters met at bofa headquarters in charlotte and by phone until around  pm the next morning the exhausted participants were shocked to read a full account in the wall street journal of how robert kelly was being recruited for the bofa post kelly and his team were furious suspecting that insiders who wanted to see bofa executive brian moynihan get the job had leaked the story to the journal theyre forcing me to drop out kelly complained that day he wrote a memo to his executive committee addressing the bofa report i want to make clear i am not interested in early december it appeared that bank of america would repay tarp far sooner than expected the bofa board wanted desperately to escape the programs pay restrictions so that the company could hire an outsider as ceo the preference of the majority of the directors its sixperson search committee began once again courting their favorite candidate bob kelly and kelly was still more than willing to listen    citi ceo banks need regulation this time kelly informed von schack about the new negotiations as soon as they started at the breakfast on tuesday in boston before a scheduled board meeting kelly delivered the news to all the directors this is an opportunity i owe my family he said i need to pursue it the next day von schack consulted with an executivesearch firm to begin identifying ceo candidates if as seemed probable kelly took the bofa job von schack also told kelly they needed his decision virtually right away but wednesday thursday and friday passed and kellys letter of resignation didnt arrive so on saturday von schack called kelly to establish a deadline kelly had  hours to decide if he was leaving the board von schack said had a meeting scheduled for monday at  pm if they hadnt heard from kelly by then they would announce that he had resigned meanwhile the bofa board began to have its second thoughts now that the bank had repaid tarp regulators couldnt block the deal nor did anyone in the administration threaten any regulatory backlash but bofa directors did call geithner for guidance without expressing an opinion geithner suggested that the board check with feinberg on a conference call feinberg again told the directors that they would have to be crazy to make the deal and that the new ceos first days would be spent getting pilloried by outraged members of congress at sensational hearings for kelly it was a case of damned either way it was obvious that the bofa board was fractured several directors favored moynihan  who ultimately landed the job  and were using the political climate as a reason to sabotage his deal kelly also had to consider the damage if he did get the package hed been requesting regulators would no longer think of him as a distinguished banker just as another ceo whose compensation the public reviled while kelly was weighing these issues the bny board was considering its options among the internal candidates to replace kelly some board members favored the president gerald hassell a bank of new york lifer who early in his career impressed biondi as a lending officer in the cbs building on the avenue of the americas but the directors were also compelled to mount a search for outside candidates and they feared that the process could drag on for weeks or even months and that it might end up being highly expensive if they chose an outside candidate and had to buy him out of his contract pointedly they wanted to avoid the mess that the bank of america search had become when kelly swept into the conference room that monday and pleaded to keep his job he gave the board an out yes they were stung by his betrayal but they justified taking him back by saying that it would be better for bny not to change leadership while the economic recovery was still fragile after kelly was excused from the meeting the general sentiment on the conference call was relief instead of the press release announcing kellys departure employees got an email that same afternoon from the boss it said i firmly concluded that my place is here at bny mellon the boards motive for taking kelly back  not wanting to disrupt the banks operations and management and hoping to avoid a potentially messy succession  was a weak one they now had to worry about kellys loyalty and the relationship between the ceo and his board would turn increasingly suspicious and adversarial two days after kelly returned he had dinner with three directors von schack john luke ceo of meadwestvaco mwv fortune  who chairs the governance committee and catherine rein a former top executive at metlife met fortune  and a year veteran of the board they expressed their alarm at his flirtation with bofa the directors told kelly he would have to spend time mending fences with them  and were alarmed when kelly seemed surprised they also informed kelly that if he were to leave hassell would replace him as ceo hassell they told kelly had just the skills they prized he knew the complex custody business intimately and spent every waking hour working to please customers kelly would need to work extremely closely with hassell but the warnings didnt chasten kelly who bridled more than ever under the boards authority in june  the threeyear freeze on committee chairmanships expired kelly recommended to von shack and luke that the board change the chairs of two committees  rein who heads the audit committee and nicholas donofrio a former ibm ibm fortune  executive who leads the risk committee after a brief discussion the board rejected the suggestion on the grounds that the two chairpersons had recently received excellent evaluations from their committee members von schack reminded kelly that it was the job of the independent directors excluding the management members to choose committee chairs the incident didnt win kelly any goodwill in the boardroom the directors began to fret that bny mellon was losing talent around the time of the tiff over board chairs two potential future ceo candidates left ronald ohanley the assetmanagement chief departed for fidelity and the head of wealth management david lamere left without taking a new job kelly took a no big deal attitude in explaining their exits to the board but to the directors it was a very big deal the board had been pressing kelly to improve managements bench strength suddenly two possible future ceo candidates were gone in replacing ohanley kelly managed to anger one of his biggest customers the ceo announced in august  that he had recruited curtis arledge from blackrock the worlds largest asset manager kelly lured arledge with an overthetop compensation package that could pay him more than  million in less than two years as well as promises to groom him as a successor in the late s arledge had been an early blackrock employee but he had left and later overlapped with kelly at wachovia hed been hired back at blackrock in  and just eight months earlier had been promoted to a new role handling the firms big fixedincome clients blackrocks ceo larry fink and its president robert kapito were furious they hated changing the cast that served their customers most of all they were incensed that kelly had the audacity to raid a big client without so much as a courtesy call after hearing that fink and kapito were upset kelly took hassell and went to see them at blackrocks offices on east nd street but when fink vented his frustration kelly took a cavalier its just business approach that did nothing to soothe finks ire that kind of imperious behavior repeatedly caused kelly to clash with his board too for example kelly was appalled by the condition of bnys headquarters in a  art deco building on the corner of wall street and broadway he explored different options from a sweeping renovation to the construction of a new building  developments the board first learned about from a news article in may  kelly talked incessantly about his desire to move to an expensive ultramodern headquarters annoying the board to no end finally this past summer von schack informed kelly that the board didnt feel it was a good time to spend a lot of money on relocating in december  the compensation committee collected its annual written appraisals from the  independent directors many of the reviews were extremely critical so in february of this year the board assigned five directors to meet with kelly and discuss the poor evaluations the board believed it was sending him a major warning signal according to people whove spoken with kelly since his dismissal however he didnt think the meeting was a warning rather he viewed it merely as his annual review and a good one at that indeed the board gave him a  million bonus for  including  of his target based on his individual performance since late  the directors had been pushing kelly to hold a big management meeting to fully present his strategic plan for how bny would grow at first kelly resisted arguing that he needed to focus on addressing regulatory issues and shoring up the balance sheet but even before the review in february the directors began to increase the pressure the board wanted to know how kelly planned to control the rising expenses that were eating into profits they viewed the strategy session as a crucial test finally kelly scheduled the conclave for june  at the doral arrowwood resort in rye brook ny but it was hassell as well as other lieutenants who handled the big presentations and who showed the surest mastery of how to raise bnys lagging profitability for the board the meeting was further evidence that their backup candidate was really their man kelly took a passive role the end of the union if the kelly saga has a tipping point it came on the evening of the presentations at the arrowwood the board was already worried that kelly had become a divisive figure after dinner several top executives quietly approached directors and complained about kellys leadership charging that he played favorites hassell was not among the grousers he wouldnt complain if his fingers were being cut off remarks an insider who knows him well but the board was alarmed in the days that followed von schack initiated confidential meetings with several more managers and heard much the same story it became clear that there were problems brewing one example was the way kelly treated the general counsel jane sherburne a highprofile hire who joined bny in may  sherburne had served as gc at wachovia and remains highly respected in washington from her days as a former white house special counsel in the clinton administration in addition to her role as general counsel the board insisted that sherburne take on the position of chief of government affairs  which meant infringing on a role that kelly had enjoyed filling more than once kelly openly denigrated sherburne to the distaste of the board while discussing one issue he remarked to directors that jane should have caught that another time he remarked witheringly that jane has to make changes to get used to our culture the board though felt sherburne missed nothing and considered kellys criticisms vindictive the final blow came in early august of this year when kelly presented to the board a plan to lay off  employees  just one day before he made it public the move was a shock to the directors they saw it as an unplanned reflexive reaction to criticism from wall street it hadnt been discussed at all at the strategy session the board felt that the ceo was forcing its hand on aug  von schack and samuel scott head of the human resources committee and the retired ceo of corn products cpo went to kellys office they told kelly that the board wanted him to leave kellys reaction was total amazement when he asked why the directors simply said that the board had lost confidence in him to the point where he had to resign or be fired gerald hassell was being promoted to ceo they declined to give further explanation in retrospect the union of bob kelly and bank of new york mellon was a classic case of miscasting the board ultimately didnt want a visionary in charge so much as an operations mastermind there was a mismatch between bob and the processoriented culture of bny says one of his friends by pursuing the bofa job kelly made it clear that his heart wasnt with bank of new york mellon it was only a matter of time before the relationship dissolved kellys friends say he has no desire to retire even after pocketing his full severance and retirement benefits worth  million he is regrouping and hopes soon to be back where he feels he belongs  running a large financial company to improve his odds of success he should choose his next board carefully this article is from the december   issue of fortune  first published november    am et related articles  businessperson of the yearfinally finance bonuses return to earthtime to buy us banks robert kelly fall of bank of new york mellons superstar  nov   fortune  by the numbers robert kelly inside the fall of a superstar banker by katie benner and shawn tully november    am et two years ago the bank of new york mellon ceo almost left to run bank of america but he changed his mind and the board welcomed him back thats when the trouble started fortune  when robert kelly walked into the white house that monday morning he had every reason to be on edge it was dec   and the ceo of bank of new york mellon was one of an elite group of bankers who had been summoned by president obama at the time kelly was deep in negotiations to leave his post at bny mellon the eighthbiggest us bank by assets and take the top job at the industrys largest institution bank of america the previous tuesday hed told the bny mellon board at a breakfast in boston that bank of america wants me for the job and that he planned to take it the  am meeting with the president was held in the windowless roosevelt room just steps from the oval office kelly and fellow ceos including john stumpf of wells fargo wfc fortune  and jamie dimon of jp morgan chase jpm fortune  found seats at the table next to officials such as white house economic adviser christina romer and treasury secretary timothy geithner when the meeting came to order president obama delivered a stern message he urged the bankers to revive lending to small businesses and lectured them about wall street pay the federal government the president stressed had rescued the banks during the financial crisis and it was beyond any notion of common sense  a virtual insult in fact  for their top brass to pocket gigantic pay packages after the american taxpayer had bailed them out comment ironically kelly had for days been pushing for precisely the kind of exorbitant pay from bank of america bac fortune  that president obama was condemning the week before bofa had fully repaid its  billion from the troubled asset relief program officially freeing itself from tarps draconian restrictions on compensation over the next three days the bofa search committee hammered out a draft contract with kelly that included an upfront payment of more than  million and guaranteed another  million to  million a year the committee even agreed to kellys demand that bofa move its headquarters from charlotte to new york city where kelly owns a sumptuous townhouse but over the weekend the bofa directors had begun fretting about what they should have foreseen before offering kelly such a sweet deal a populist uproar on capitol hill the instant the news broke if kelly needed more evidence that his dream package was endangered the presidents harsh words in the roosevelt room that monday seemed to seal its fate he must have realized that his chances of securing perhaps the biggest job in banking were fading fast incredibly kelly still had a few hours to save his highly lucrative ceo post at bny mellon bny  even though this wasnt the first but the second time in just two months hed flirted with bofa the bny mellon board had scheduled a meeting at  pm to announce kellys departure and had the press release ready to go so kelly raced back from the white house to new york to save his job he called lead director wesley von schack from reagan national airport and declared i want to stay around  pm he arrived in a conference room at bnys headquarters at  wall st where von schack was talking to the other directors on speakerphone von schack a retired ceo of utility energy east invited kelly to speak the ceo was now practically begging for his job from the same directors hed brushed off a week before i dont like the way bofa has handled this process he explained i wouldnt have a good working relationship with the directors he apologized for his actions and added this is where i want to be the bny mellon directors spent some time deliberating  and took kelly back it was a fateful and misguided decision in retrospect it would have been far better if the board had forced him to go ahead with his resignation that afternoon because from that point on the relationship with his lieutenants the directors and especially von schack was poisoned the surreal events of that day marked the start of a downward spiral of distrust at bny mellon that less than two years later would end in kellys forced resignation  this time for real  on aug  of this year the press release that day contained a singlesentence explanation for kellys exit robert p kelly has stepped down due to differences in approach to managing the company kellys departure  the sudden shocking resignation of a star ceo  has received remarkably little attention or explanation today bny mellon stands in the spotlight primarily as the target of two major legal battles first the us department of justice and a handful of state attorneys general are seeking more than  billion in damages from bny charging that the bank cheated customers in foreignexchange transactions  alleged practices that long predate kelly for more on those charges see box second bny serving as trustee endorsed an  billion agreement between bofa and investors that bought bofas toxic mortgages  and now its being sued by the new york attorney generals office saying that bny failed in its duty as trustee of the mortgagebacked securities    protesters want more from bank of america but now for the first time the full story of kellys fall from grace can be told fortune assembled the dramatic narrative from interviews with dozens of sources almost none of whom spoke for attribution but whose accounts could be confirmed by others the tale chronicles a total mismatch between the personality and skills of a ceo and the challenges and culture of the company he was running robert kelly  can be a charming leader with a sophisticated financial mind his history shows that hes always looking for the next new thing  a grander job more money and more excitement kelly who declined to be interviewed for this story is a bigpicture thinker with an artistic creative temperament who relishes business as an adventure his weakness is a surfeit of selfconfidence bordering on hubris bny mellon couldnt have been a worse fit for kelly with  billion in  revenue bny mellon rankedno  in this years fortune   the thlargest commercial bank on the list but its a highly conservative oldline institution that specializes in mundane grinditout businesses and prizes tradition selfeffacement and loyalty it is a major player in asset management but its signature franchise where it ranks no  globally is asset servicing  the business of performing record keeping securities lending and backoffice tasks for investment funds and financial institutions thats anything but glamorous and its not bob kelly the story of bob kellys downfall isnt primarily about bnys financial performance which was middling but hardly disastrous its chiefly a classic study in a dysfunctional relationship between a boss and a board even after pleading to keep his job he bristled at taking orders from the directors who took him back he kept going his own way making decision after decision without consulting the board  everything from exploring options for a new headquarters to a surprise plan to shrink the workforce and veteran directors never got over what they viewed as an act of disloyalty that fateful week in december genteel was not bobs style a canadian by birth robert kelly grew up in the scenic atlantic port city of halifax in nova scotia where his father worked as a tax accountant canadians like to compare nova scotia to americas midwest both have a culture that encourages affability and plainspokenness  qualities that his friends say kelly shares notably an unadorned bluntness after graduating from saint marys university in halifax with a degree in accounting kelly joined kpmg and quickly discovered a way to win new clients in  he bought one of the first desktop computers the radio shack trs he learned to program the machine and showed small businesses how to reap major savings by keeping their books electronically in  kelly joined torontodominion bank td in its information technology department moving to london soon after kelly wrote pioneering programs that quickly valued the interest rate and currency derivatives that were just gaining favor in europe giving tds traders an edge that brought big profits he became cfo in  at age  bob was highly analytical a great salesman and he even made business fun recalls stephen mcdonald a former colleague at td and now coceo of investment bank scotia capital it was clear he was a top candidate to be ceo and wanted the job but kelly lost his opportunity when td acquired canada trust financial and named its ceo w edmund clark as heir apparent in  kelly joined first union in charlotte  soon to be renamed wachovia  as cfo first union was undergoing a painful restructuring following years of whirlwind expansion that had turned reckless with the disastrous acquisitions of corestates and the money store in the northeast kelly brought a relentless disciplined approach to measuring which businesses and acquisitions provided the best returns and ensuring that the bank allocated its capital to those areas during his tenure as cfo from  to early  wachovia delivered shareholders a total return of  handily beating both the bank index and the sp  spx for two straight years  and  the analysts polled by institutional investor voted bob kelly the best cfo of a large bank in america one of the great mysteries of the kelly saga is that a leader so well liked at wachovia would rouse so much illfeeling from his coworkers and his board just a few years later at bny mellon but in retrospect its also remarkable that at wachovia kelly fared so well in a courtly culture at odds with his own curt style it was a civil southern place and that wasnt bob recalls thomas wurtz who served as treasurer under kelly bob was honest and direct kelly sparred frequently with ceo ken thompson who wanted to make wachovia a big player in capital markets a business kelly disliked i dont see it that way hed tell his superiors in meetings showing resistance practically unheardof at the bank genteel was not bobs style says gregory thompson a former financial executive at wachovia he wouldnt be offensive but hed dig his heels in bny mellons cast of characters kellys coworkers at wachovia found him a downtoearth fascinating colleague with a zany side bob had this boisterous laugh you could hear across the floor recalls former general counsel mark treanor his colleagues still marvel over his mathematical abstract drawings often in meetings hed do penandink caricatures of the folks in the room on a big pad while they discussed loan reserves or foreignexchange hedging then get smiles when he showed them their likenesses one year kelly held a christmas party at his home with a professional caricaturist on hand to draw the guests at the evenings end kelly turned the easel around and made a quick sketch of the caricaturist that at least equaled the experts work the doodling seemed to give him a freedom of thought so that his brain could roam freely so that he was unbounded by pure logic says gregory thompson who describes kelly as a d thinker a history buff kelly festooned his office with photos of winston churchill and orville wright as well as a seventh edition of adam smiths the wealth of nations from  purchased on ebay kelly craved the limelight he adored for example giving witty speeches explaining wachovias strategy to employees at call centers but according to wachovia veterans kelly also wanted to be the public face of wachovia and chafed that ken thompson not bob kelly played the main part in telling the wachovia story to wall street a friend of kellys who considers him a terrific banker explains why kelly can be either enthralling or irksome depending on the audience bob is used to being the smartest guy in the room he says he presents his ideas like theyre amazing the people wowed by him love it they feel lucky to be throwing ideas around with a guy that smart but for those not wowed by his ideas or who have a different view says the friend he comes across as offputting arrogant and sometimes rude    big fat banker bonuses unbelievable because he was around the same age as thompson kellys prospects of ever becoming ceo of wachovia looked dim but he had suitors in  the board of mellon financial decided that kelly was just the change agent it needed to revive the fabled institution then under extreme pressure from activist hedge funds and kellys biggest champion on the mellon board was a flinty retired utility executive  none other than wesley von schack kelly was announced as ceo of mellon in february  it didnt take kelly long to make a transformative move in early december after just  months at mellon kelly announced a major deal  a merger with bank of new york to kelly the union made great business sense bny was powerful in asset servicing but underweight in asset management for mellon the mix was the reverse it boasted a major investment franchise and a puny presence in custody a few bny directors worried that in their interviews with kelly he was in the all about me mode incessantly talking about his accomplishments still the two boards determined that bnys chief thomas renyi would remain as chairman but step down as ceo kelly would take charge running a business three times the size of the former mellon kelly the performer didnt hesitate to sketch a fantastic picture of the union on dec   in a webcast to analysts kelly predicted that the combined bny mellon would begin by posting  billion in aftertax earnings and grow rapidly from there but the bank wouldnt come close to delivering on those promises it took until  to reach the  billion profit goal a big reason for that of course was that the bottom dropped out of the economy not long after the merger but eventually the board came to perceive kelly as lacking sufficient desire to cultivate clients or the will to control escalating costs at the outset though the two companies appeared to meld extremely well they boasted two of the longest proudest histories in the annals of american business bank of new york was the oldest financial institution in america founded by alexander hamilton in  family patriarch thomas mellon had launched his bank in  a key difference bank of new york was renowned for frugality bordering on outright cheapness in the s dozens of analysts would stand in line waiting to use a handful of bloomberg terminals managers would sometimes forgo raises and bonuses for as long as two years if costs got too high the two boards merged smoothly for the most part the directors were ceos or retired ceos of mediumsized to fairly big companies often from the midwest and they shared a you work for us attitude toward management notably one current director and mellon board holdover is john surma ceo of us steel who as a trustee of penn state this november was the person who announced that legendary football coach joe paterno had been fired the board bonded quickly says frank biondi a former chairman of viacom via who left the board in  it didnt have highprofile people but it was a smart capable group the directors assisted kelly by creating an integration task force reporting directly to the board which over time created  billion in cost savings by closing offices reducing staff and merging systems kelly had barely settled in to his new office in new york when he faced his first major test the financial crisis struck in mid pounding assetmanagement fees as bond and stock prices plummeted to the board kellys leadership through the crisis looked sound bny took far smaller losses than most other banks and paid back its tarp money earlier by late  the stock had rebounded to  from a low of  kelly was playing a major role in several industry groups including the prestigious financial services roundtable and was highly respected in washington as a counselor to the administration on regulatory matters at the time his public role appealed to the directors over breakfast the day of each board meeting kelly would keep the directors informed on what bny could expect from regulatory reform in washington his role as ambassador was also good business bny mellon won the exclusive contract from the treasury department to handle all of the bookkeeping accounting and distressedasset auctions for tarp in return the board gave its ceo the royal treatment the compensation committee headed by von schack modeled kellys compensation after that of highly paid ceos of extremely large companies  mostly a lot larger than bny mellon  including jp morgan blackrock blk fortune  citigroup c fortune  and wells fargo from  to  kelly earned on average  million a year making him one of americas highestpaid ceos financial or otherwise the directors believed kelly was leading bny to the big time outside the office kelly enjoyed a lifestyle worthy of a wall street titan in  he paid  million for a fivestory squarefoot townhouse on manhattans upper east side nine blocks from the stately former mellon family mansion the house was meticulously renovated in the mackintosh architectural style inspired by the british artsandcrafts school the library shelving was carved from a single walnut tree a folkart canadian mountie doll was placed in the parlor floor window as if to stand guard kellys flirtation with bofa the crack that would weaken then destroy the bonds of trust between kelly and the board opened when kelly began his onagain offagain dance with bank of america in late october  kelly started negotiations with bofa  without telling his board from the start any agreement faced a stiff obstacle it would cost bofa well over  million to buy out kellys package of stock and retirement benefits at bny mellon kelly wanted a chance to run the nations biggest bank but he didnt want to give up his lucrative compensation to do so bofa was still under the tarp rules so the treasury department could veto a pay deal it considered excessive members of the compensation committee tried negotiating with kenneth feinberg at the time the obama administrations executivecompensation czar but feinberg adamantly opposed any large buyout saying that it was totally inappropriate for a company taking government money and it would never happen on his watch as it turned out feinbergs objections werent the deal killer on nov  kelly members of the search committee and assorted lawyers and headhunters met at bofa headquarters in charlotte and by phone until around  pm the next morning the exhausted participants were shocked to read a full account in the wall street journal of how robert kelly was being recruited for the bofa post kelly and his team were furious suspecting that insiders who wanted to see bofa executive brian moynihan get the job had leaked the story to the journal theyre forcing me to drop out kelly complained that day he wrote a memo to his executive committee addressing the bofa report i want to make clear i am not interested in early december it appeared that bank of america would repay tarp far sooner than expected the bofa board wanted desperately to escape the programs pay restrictions so that the company could hire an outsider as ceo the preference of the majority of the directors its sixperson search committee began once again courting their favorite candidate bob kelly and kelly was still more than willing to listen    citi ceo banks need regulation this time kelly informed von schack about the new negotiations as soon as they started at the breakfast on tuesday in boston before a scheduled board meeting kelly delivered the news to all the directors this is an opportunity i owe my family he said i need to pursue it the next day von schack consulted with an executivesearch firm to begin identifying ceo candidates if as seemed probable kelly took the bofa job von schack also told kelly they needed his decision virtually right away but wednesday thursday and friday passed and kellys letter of resignation didnt arrive so on saturday von schack called kelly to establish a deadline kelly had  hours to decide if he was leaving the board von schack said had a meeting scheduled for monday at  pm if they hadnt heard from kelly by then they would announce that he had resigned meanwhile the bofa board began to have its second thoughts now that the bank had repaid tarp regulators couldnt block the deal nor did anyone in the administration threaten any regulatory backlash but bofa directors did call geithner for guidance without expressing an opinion geithner suggested that the board check with feinberg on a conference call feinberg again told the directors that they would have to be crazy to make the deal and that the new ceos first days would be spent getting pilloried by outraged members of congress at sensational hearings for kelly it was a case of damned either way it was obvious that the bofa board was fractured several directors favored moynihan  who ultimately landed the job  and were using the political climate as a reason to sabotage his deal kelly also had to consider the damage if he did get the package hed been requesting regulators would no longer think of him as a distinguished banker just as another ceo whose compensation the public reviled while kelly was weighing these issues the bny board was considering its options among the internal candidates to replace kelly some board members favored the president gerald hassell a bank of new york lifer who early in his career impressed biondi as a lending officer in the cbs building on the avenue of the americas but the directors were also compelled to mount a search for outside candidates and they feared that the process could drag on for weeks or even months and that it might end up being highly expensive if they chose an outside candidate and had to buy him out of his contract pointedly they wanted to avoid the mess that the bank of america search had become when kelly swept into the conference room that monday and pleaded to keep his job he gave the board an out yes they were stung by his betrayal but they justified taking him back by saying that it would be better for bny not to change leadership while the economic recovery was still fragile after kelly was excused from the meeting the general sentiment on the conference call was relief instead of the press release announcing kellys departure employees got an email that same afternoon from the boss it said i firmly concluded that my place is here at bny mellon the boards motive for taking kelly back  not wanting to disrupt the banks operations and management and hoping to avoid a potentially messy succession  was a weak one they now had to worry about kellys loyalty and the relationship between the ceo and his board would turn increasingly suspicious and adversarial two days after kelly returned he had dinner with three directors von schack john luke ceo of meadwestvaco mwv fortune  who chairs the governance committee and catherine rein a former top executive at metlife met fortune  and a year veteran of the board they expressed their alarm at his flirtation with bofa the directors told kelly he would have to spend time mending fences with them  and were alarmed when kelly seemed surprised they also informed kelly that if he were to leave hassell would replace him as ceo hassell they told kelly had just the skills they prized he knew the complex custody business intimately and spent every waking hour working to please customers kelly would need to work extremely closely with hassell but the warnings didnt chasten kelly who bridled more than ever under the boards authority in june  the threeyear freeze on committee chairmanships expired kelly recommended to von shack and luke that the board change the chairs of two committees  rein who heads the audit committee and nicholas donofrio a former ibm ibm fortune  executive who leads the risk committee after a brief discussion the board rejected the suggestion on the grounds that the two chairpersons had recently received excellent evaluations from their committee members von schack reminded kelly that it was the job of the independent directors excluding the management members to choose committee chairs the incident didnt win kelly any goodwill in the boardroom the directors began to fret that bny mellon was losing talent around the time of the tiff over board chairs two potential future ceo candidates left ronald ohanley the assetmanagement chief departed for fidelity and the head of wealth management david lamere left without taking a new job kelly took a no big deal attitude in explaining their exits to the board but to the directors it was a very big deal the board had been pressing kelly to improve managements bench strength suddenly two possible future ceo candidates were gone in replacing ohanley kelly managed to anger one of his biggest customers the ceo announced in august  that he had recruited curtis arledge from blackrock the worlds largest asset manager kelly lured arledge with an overthetop compensation package that could pay him more than  million in less than two years as well as promises to groom him as a successor in the late s arledge had been an early blackrock employee but he had left and later overlapped with kelly at wachovia hed been hired back at blackrock in  and just eight months earlier had been promoted to a new role handling the firms big fixedincome clients blackrocks ceo larry fink and its president robert kapito were furious they hated changing the cast that served their customers most of all they were incensed that kelly had the audacity to raid a big client without so much as a courtesy call after hearing that fink and kapito were upset kelly took hassell and went to see them at blackrocks offices on east nd street but when fink vented his frustration kelly took a cavalier its just business approach that did nothing to soothe finks ire that kind of imperious behavior repeatedly caused kelly to clash with his board too for example kelly was appalled by the condition of bnys headquarters in a  art deco building on the corner of wall street and broadway he explored different options from a sweeping renovation to the construction of a new building  developments the board first learned about from a news article in may  kelly talked incessantly about his desire to move to an expensive ultramodern headquarters annoying the board to no end finally this past summer von schack informed kelly that the board didnt feel it was a good time to spend a lot of money on relocating in december  the compensation committee collected its annual written appraisals from the  independent directors many of the reviews were extremely critical so in february of this year the board assigned five directors to meet with kelly and discuss the poor evaluations the board believed it was sending him a major warning signal according to people whove spoken with kelly since his dismissal however he didnt think the meeting was a warning rather he viewed it merely as his annual review and a good one at that indeed the board gave him a  million bonus for  including  of his target based on his individual performance since late  the directors had been pushing kelly to hold a big management meeting to fully present his strategic plan for how bny would grow at first kelly resisted arguing that he needed to focus on addressing regulatory issues and shoring up the balance sheet but even before the review in february the directors began to increase the pressure the board wanted to know how kelly planned to control the rising expenses that were eating into profits they viewed the strategy session as a crucial test finally kelly scheduled the conclave for june  at the doral arrowwood resort in rye brook ny but it was hassell as well as other lieutenants who handled the big presentations and who showed the surest mastery of how to raise bnys lagging profitability for the board the meeting was further evidence that their backup candidate was really their man kelly took a passive role the end of the union if the kelly saga has a tipping point it came on the evening of the presentations at the arrowwood the board was already worried that kelly had become a divisive figure after dinner several top executives quietly approached directors and complained about kellys leadership charging that he played favorites hassell was not among the grousers he wouldnt complain if his fingers were being cut off remarks an insider who knows him well but the board was alarmed in the days that followed von schack initiated confidential meetings with several more managers and heard much the same story it became clear that there were problems brewing one example was the way kelly treated the general counsel jane sherburne a highprofile hire who joined bny in may  sherburne had served as gc at wachovia and remains highly respected in washington from her days as a former white house special counsel in the clinton administration in addition to her role as general counsel the board insisted that sherburne take on the position of chief of government affairs  which meant infringing on a role that kelly had enjoyed filling more than once kelly openly denigrated sherburne to the distaste of the board while discussing one issue he remarked to directors that jane should have caught that another time he remarked witheringly that jane has to make changes to get used to our culture the board though felt sherburne missed nothing and considered kellys criticisms vindictive the final blow came in early august of this year when kelly presented to the board a plan to lay off  employees  just one day before he made it public the move was a shock to the directors they saw it as an unplanned reflexive reaction to criticism from wall street it hadnt been discussed at all at the strategy session the board felt that the ceo was forcing its hand on aug  von schack and samuel scott head of the human resources committee and the retired ceo of corn products cpo went to kellys office they told kelly that the board wanted him to leave kellys reaction was total amazement when he asked why the directors simply said that the board had lost confidence in him to the point where he had to resign or be fired gerald hassell was being promoted to ceo they declined to give further explanation in retrospect the union of bob kelly and bank of new york mellon was a classic case of miscasting the board ultimately didnt want a visionary in charge so much as an operations mastermind there was a mismatch between bob and the processoriented culture of bny says one of his friends by pursuing the bofa job kelly made it clear that his heart wasnt with bank of new york mellon it was only a matter of time before the relationship dissolved kellys friends say he has no desire to retire even after pocketing his full severance and retirement benefits worth  million he is regrouping and hopes soon to be back where he feels he belongs  running a large financial company to improve his odds of success he should choose his next board carefully this article is from

what everything meant in regards to my misdemeanor charge it was very comforting since id never been in trouble before well it was until the one time my father also an attorney but of a different sort was not able to go to my court date with me mr keirnan didnt even bother to tell me that he wasnt going to show up at the beginning like i had to even though he had always been there from the start of court before i sat in the court room for  hours wondering where my attorney was and why i couldnt get an answer from him or his office as to what was going on finally my father who was on vacation decided to call casey and immediately got the answer he had other court appearances to make as well and attended those first apparently since my dad wasnt around by the time casey made it to the court room  hours after the session began the judge had gone home sick for the day since my court date kept getting reset i had to go a couple more times before it was settled in that time i tried to call mr keirnan in regards to my case with a question but he could never be bothered to return my calls only my fathers i guess even though i was his client he was simply too good to talk to me he chose to go through my father and only took time to make sure i understood what was happening when my father was around it was all for show yes he did his job and i have no complaints as to the results i just dont like the fact that i paid that much money to a man who couldnt even call me back about my case now that i am getting my record sealed i am going through the same bs with a lady in his office who handles nondisclosures and expunctures all the time i am downright pissed off at this point and regret ever going to this practice to begin with thanks to this lady my entire life is on hold still because she has yet to file the papers three weeks after cashing the check for payment in full she knows this also so i she either does not care or is incapable of finding out when the right time of day is to file the papers not very reassuring for someone who does this kind of thing all the time technically i could have had my record sealed two weeks ago but she cant even call me back at the times she says she will call me i have to hunt her down basically i could have handled this matter myself and had it all done and over with long ago in less than the amount of time she requires to manage to get herself to the court when the right person is thereif you have the need for a defense attorney youve already got enough stress to deal with dont add to it by hiring anyone in this office or this attorney either they obviously care only about the money the make from their job not the people they representbennett  bennett houston criminaldefense lawyersf b ratedif there be any doubt in your mind about selecting mark bennett to defend you against a legal assault mounted by the federal state or local judicial systems against your life liberty or happinesscast them aside if you are reading this you are very likely under such assault just know there is only one goal to this assault and that is to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law regardless of guilt or innocence or extenuating circumstance it is their job and they like it and the only thing standing between you and a conviction is your defense attorney upon whom your fate will utterly depend so you had better make the right choice i can personally attest that they don’t come any better than mark bennett period he is the best of the best a lawyer’s lawyer with compassion integrity and a deeply intuitive situational intelligence that enables him to create highly effective strategies and tactics to win your case he can think within the box outside the box and even upend the box if necessarywhatever the situation requires not only does he keep up with the very latest developments in federal state and local legal standards practices and laws his cutting edge commentaries and articles on a wide variety of evolving legal issues help to shape and inform the attitudes and opinions of innumerable practicing lawyers and judges both locally and nationally on at least one occasion while in court he actually had to educate the judge and prosecutor of a change in the law which as a matter of course led to yet another dismissal this is a defense attorney that you want at your sideterry  thweatt pc attorneys at lawkirkbr ratedterry  thweatt is a god sent firm i suffered severe burns to my stomach when i was eating at a fast food restaurant i looked up injury attorneys located in the texas city area and came across terry  thweatt so i called them but was politely informed by irene one of the assistants that their office is located in houston irene continued to get information regarding my injuries and then transferred my call to one of the attorneys joseph terry i was able to get an appointment that same day terry explained the process that we would be involved in and let me know that it can be a long process attorney joseph terry was patient and answered all my questions  all my girlfriend’s questions and concerns i decided to give them a try and man am i glad that i did this firm is by far the most professional and friendly business that i have had to deal with not only are they friendly over the phone but in person too i know that i am not the easiest person to deal with but irene was persistent friendly and professional throughout the whole case unlike other places that are only friendly the first time that you come in to sign the contract i am very happy with the outcome of my case and the services that terry  thweatt provided me with i highly recommend terry  thweatt especially joseph terry to anyone that needs a lawyer for injuries that they suffer because he is so knowledgeable and efficient thank you joseph terry and irenecogdell dansecret n ratedmr akers and the cogdell law firm represented me when i was charged with felony theft i was accused of stealing a bag which contained items belonging to offduty police officers a felony conviction of this nature would have prevented me from practicing my chosen career due to the gravity of the charges against me i knew that i needed immediate proven and effective representation mr akers began gathering information about my case as soon as we ended our telephone conversation and was up to speed for our first meeting he laid out the best case scenario as well as worst case scenario and his recommended plan to resolve the charges against me cordt and his firm kept me appraised to every step that occurred with my case they were able to reschedule hearings for me when i was absolutely unable to travel to harris county for them cordt was available to me whenever i needed to get into contact with him when the prosecution would not budge cordt had informed me that he had already been preparing for trial in case that was the route i chose to take ultimately cordt was able to get the charges against me dismissed for which i am truly grateful requiring a criminal defense attorney means you are already in a stressful and worrying situation i recommend cordt akers to lift some weight off of your shoulders and to guide you through the legal system returning a favorable outcome h brad parker p cn r ratedi hired mr h brad parker seven years ago for bankruptcy and he and his office took the time to understand the specifics of my case the law office of h brad parker helped me save my home from foreclosure and fought the creditors that tried to bring additional financial ruin to me my case was not an easy one and not once did mr parker shun away from the obstacles he was always ready to fight my case and find a way bring justice in fact when my case was discharged some creditors surfaced and tried to falsely collect on a debt once again mr parker was immediately on the case and working toward a favorable result for memr parker went the extra mile for my case he is sincere in his approach and truly cared about the impact of a negative judgment in my case he seeks justice and is concerned about my future as it relates to my case my only regret is that i did not find mr parker years earlier when i needed a family lawyer for any person seeking an honest sincere expert lawyer look no further mr parker’s approach may be different than other lawyers but it is a breath of fresh air you are not a number when a client at h brad parker offices but part of your case legal teammy experience has been so wonderful with the offices of h brad parker that i would not consider hiring any other lawyer in the houston area for my legal needsterry  thweatt pc attorneys at lawrjd ratedi just want to thank the staffi just want to thank the staff and attorneys at the law firm of terry  thweatt pc my wife and i were involved in a personal injury case that required the assistance of legal professional s we retained the services of terry  thweatt via a professional reference we were very pleased with the professionalism and expertise demonstrated by this law firm we were represented by counsel joseph terry the legal assistance provided by mr terry was instrumental in obtaining results that far exceeded our expectations the demeanor and attitude of mr terry and his staff demonstrates that this law firm does what many other law firms repeatedly fail to do put the client’s interest first granted our case did require a little patience but what matters in the end are the results overall the experience that we had with this law firm was a positive and pleasant one it’s difficult to find attorney’s that are honest straightforward and most importantly client service driven the law firm of terry  thweat clearly reflects a client service driven culture therefore i highly recommend this law firm for such legal matters thank you again and keep up the great workrs houston txnossa law office pcdn f ratedresidency my wife stayed in the us on an expired visa when i

percent of recovered funds thats pretty much the standard so i agreed i got the first check  she took her fee then i got the final amount a second checkto which she added in the first and then took another  from larger sum basically lets say i go  and she took her  then i get another  for a total of instead of taking the remaining  from the new money she added it all together and took  from  so instead of taking the next  which was rightfully hers she tried to take  which when you do the math is not  of the total recovery i told her this is double dipping you cant take fees from every check

experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship

you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off
