live up to its own hype and solve—yes solve—the knottiest social problems note the subtitle of his book why philanthropy doesn’t advance social progress not can’t or won’t mind you but simply doesn’t he has a point despite all the efforts of philanthropists social indicators have weakened for the average american over the last  years from educational attainment to preparing for an aging population we are not ready for the nation’s big longterm challenges yet goldberg thinks that the answers to those problems are within the reach of philanthropy if only money were spent more wisely
