stinger gel honey stinger waffles huma gel glukos gel sport beans the balanced solution energy gels by themselves are extremely hypertonic more concentrated then your body fluids which means that you have to consume water to ensure that they are rapidly absorbed this is the case for all gels gu clif shot and others water dilutes the gel and lowers the concentration osmolality thus increasing the absorption rate if you consume just the right amount of water the combined solution will become isotonic the same concentration as your body fluids which allows for rapid absorption hydration and maximum energy delivery if you try to get your electrolytes by drinking a sports drink instead of water it will not properly dilute the gel thus slowing the absorption rate this can also lead to stomach irritation and a dehydrating effect as your cellular fluids are drawn upon to dilute the gel read more when to use energy gels vs hydration drinks and can they be used together so if you drink water with your gel like you have to then how do you replace your electrolytes other gels contain electrolytes but they do not contain nearly enough see comparisons to provide adequate electrolyte replacement even gu says so egel on the other hand is the first electrolyte energy gel and is designed to provide complete and balanced energy hydration and electrolyte replacement in fact egel has more than  times the sodium and twice as much potassium as competing gels  egel is low in sugar why is his important if we spike the level of our blood sugar then we have lots of energy  for a little while and then we come crashing down this doesnt work so well for endurance athletes simple sugars can do just that a little bit is okay but too much will quickly raise your blood sugar if it could stay elevated life would be great but unfortunately it cant and when and comes back down it drops crashes well below where it started when this happens during athletic activity it is a dual edged sword your performance will drop as the blood sugar drops because your body is depending on that energy and your body will no longer be able to as efficiently convert your muscle glycogen into usable energy  here comes the bonk the goal is to maintain a consistent blood sugar level without the spikes and crashes and this is achieved by relying primarily on complex carbohydrates and low sugar levels and thats exactly what you get with egel pricing and specials what do our customers have to say egel is rapidly growing a loyal following  because the product works but dont just take our word for it our customers say it better than we can click below to read egels customer reviews and success stories customer reviews ingredients the primary ingredient in egel is maltodextrin a complex carbohydrate derived from corn for endurance activities you should always look for products that are high in complex carbohydrates and low in simple sugars the problem with simple sugars is that they rapidly increase your blood sugar which feels good for a short period of time but then your blood sugar can come crashing down when you give your kids candy this is called a sugar crash but when it happens to an athlete we call it bonking the carbohydrate blend in egel is  maltodextrin and  fructose and has been formulated to maximize energy delivery research has shown that products with multiple carbohydrate sources can deliver more energy to working muscles compared to products using a single carbohydrate source it is also important to note that there is a wide variety of maltodextrins with varying molecular structures egel uses the highest quality maltodextrin with a large molecular structure that allows the product to deliver even more energy for more information
