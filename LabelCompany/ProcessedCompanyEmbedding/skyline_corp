indiana usa company perspectives skyline is committed to producing the best products at the best prices it has earned a reputation for uncompromising integrity in all of its relationships with communities suppliers retailers and with the hundreds of thousands of americans who live in skylinebuilt homes and enjoy skylinebuilt rvs history of skyline corporation skyline corporation designs and produces manufactured housing and recreational vehicles rvs approximately  percent of the companys total sales are derived from manufactured homes which are sold under several different trade names skyline makes two basic types of manufactured housing singlesection mobile homes and multisection homes singlesection homes which range from  to  feet in length and  to  feet in width are often located in designated mobile home parks because their size makes them easy to move from place to place they are considered mobile homes skylines multisection homes however are larger and more closely resemble sitebuilt homes buyers typically place these homes on traditional lots and rarely if ever move them almost  percent of the homes produced by skyline are multisections the companys recreational vehicle segment manufactures three types of towable rvsconventional travel trailers fifthwheel trailers and park modelsmdash well as a line of slidein truck campers they are sold under the nomad layton aljo and weekender trademarks skyline operates  manufacturing plants in  states and distributes its products through a national network of manufactured housing and rv dealers s a new spoke in an industry hub skyline coach the predecessor to skyline corporation was established in  in elkhart indiana its founder julius decio started the business to produce mobile homes which were commonly called house trailers at the time the business decio chose was by no means an uncommon one for elkhart and its surrounding communities for  years the citylocated in northern central indiana just a few miles from the michigan borderhad been a major hub for the mobile home industry the areas mobile home business had begun in  when a local merchant decided to try replicating a contraption he had seen at the chicago worlds fair that looked like a tent on wheels setting up shop in elkhart he began building house trailers which resembled rudimentary recreational travel trailers the trailers affordability and mobility made them a good option during the great depression when many families traveled across country looking for jobs and a better life the success of this first mobile home manufacturer led others to start similar businesses and gradually the region became a major source of house trailers during the dust bowl of  and  people began using house trailers not just to travel in but as actual homes in response manufacturers modified their products to make them more closely correspond to traditional homes increasing the size of the units and adding more amenities by the end of world war ii mobile homes had evolved into something much different from their traveltrailer predecessors larger and more elaborate in design they were no longer meant to be towed camperstyle across the country by families on the move rather they had become an alternative and more affordable type of house typically stationed in one place there were however a number of manufacturers still producing the early smaller trailers primarily for use as recreational vehicles after the war these manufacturers essentially split off from the mobile home industry to form the rv industry it was into this newly bifurcated industry that julius decio entered when he began building house trailers in a friends welding garage his early efforts met with success and the business was profitable from its first year in operation in  decios yearold son art returned to elkhart from chicago where he had just graduated college art quickly took an active role in his fathers business working as a division manager in the plant and helping to build the fledgling company in  he became skylines ceo the company expanded geographically under art decios capable leadership targeting emerging mobile housing markets in retiree states such as florida another important facet of the new ceos administration was a movement toward neartotal reliance on thirdparty suppliers for materials whereas many mobile home manufacturers at that time produced some of their own cabinets and building supplies art decio preferred to order virtually everything from outside sources by having suppliers deliver inventory on a just in time basis skyline was able to minimize the need for warehouse space reduce waste and better control inventory s diversification and acquisition decio kicked off the s by taking skyline public at the time of its initial public offering the company boasted an impressive string of profitable years and no corporate debt skylines second milestone of  was to diversify its business by opening a travel trailer and rv plant in elkhart this reunion of the mobile home and rv industries made sense on several levels for the company since the industry split in the early s both the rv and housing segments had remained well represented in northern indiana dozens of rv manufacturersand the second and thirdtier suppliers supporting themhad production facilities in the region in addition many of the materials required to produce mobile homes corresponded with the materials needed to produce rvs therefore skylines addition of an rv division allowed for certain inventory and cost efficiencies skyline also used the proceeds from its  ipo to expand its mobile home business via acquisition in  the company acquired homette corporation and layton homes corporation the following year skyline bought buddy mobile homes and in  added academy mobile homes to its growing portfolio the company also changed its name from skyline coach to skyline corporation mids market downturn during the s and early s low interest rates and a generally stable economy had combined to keep the manufactured housing business in high gear according to the manufactured housing institute the industry hit an alltime high in  reporting shipments of more than half a million units in  and  however interest rates began to climb and housing sales began to plunge shipments of manufactured homes declined by  percent in  and another  percent in  the rv industry likewise fell on hard times in the s the opec oil embargo of  and the resulting hike in gas prices put the brakes on recreational driving this combined with the rising interest rates caused rv sales to fall off already contending with bleak market conditions skyline and other producers of manufactured housing were confronted with still another hurdle in  concerned about mobile homes safety congress enacted legislation that set stricter standards for their construction officially changing the products name to manufactured housing the government required all mobile homes to meet stringent manufacturing fire electricity and safety codes the tougher requirementsand the costs associated with compliancespurred a wave of closings and consolidations in the manufactured housing industry despite the odds against it skyline managed to remain solvent and successful throughout the industry slump never once posting an annual loss in  the company expanded again purchasing country vans conversion  market swings the market for rvs improved in the early years of the new decade between  and  the number of vehicles shipped increased by more than  percent the market for manufactured housing was slower to rebound however with sales remaining at levels much lower than they were in the early s skyline continued to show improved earnings and remained debtfreebut to do so it had to trim costs and streamline operations in  the company had  operational and six idle manufactured housing plants just four years later costcutting measures had reduced that number to  operational and two idle plants skyline also hedged against further economic downturns by amassing cash reserves in  onefourth of the companys pretax income came from interest the s ushered in better interest rates than consumers had seen in more than a decade and sales of manufactured housing picked up immediately although skylines sales also improved the company was unable to keep pace with its competitors and consequently surrendered part of its market share management attributed the market share loss to a lack of capacity in areas where the manufactured housing markets were expanding fastest in an april  interview with investors business daily decio cited georgia and texas as two such rapidgrowth markets pointing out that skyline did not have a strong manufacturing presence in either state even though were a national company at certain times we cant keep up he said to bolster output and remedy the situation skyline initiated an aggressive expansion plan in  the company upgraded its manufactured housing plant in sugarcreek ohio and its rv plant in mcminnville oregon the following year skyline laid out another  million to renovate four more facilitiesin indiana pennsylvania florida and louisiana in addition to boosting production the upgrades were designed to allow all facilities to manufacture a wider range of products the expansion program paid off between  and  net income improved by more than  percent in  skylines sales of manufactured housing fell slightly and the resulting dip in total sales broke the companys fiveyear record of modest but steady annual increases a major reason for the decline was an exceptionally harsh winter which slowed housing sales in some parts of the united states another factor was a general softening in the demand for manufactured housing nationwide which led many of skylines dealers to reduce their inventories the companys rv division had a better year however rv sales increased by more than  percent over  sales reversing the previous years rv industry slump the year  saw a flipflop in the fortunes of skylines two business segments the market for manufactured housing improved in the second half of the year driving up skylines housing sales in addition to the overall market improvement the housing segment benefited from a stronger demand for multisection homes which commanded higher prices than singlesection homes on the other hand skylines recreational vehicle sales decreased in  despite the fact that industrywide demand for the vehicles increased  and the new century skyline appeared to have both its business segments on track in  the market for manufactured housing remained relatively steady through the first half of the year more significantly consumer demand for multisection homes continued to grow pushing the companys housing dollars up despite a slight decrease in actual units sold as its quality continued to improve manufactured housing was expected to become an attractive option for a wider range of homeowners skylines rv business also appeared to be on the upswing as  progressed showing gains both in units sold and in sales income this increase was due in large part to overall favorable economic conditions and increased discretionary income which allowed consumers to spend more for recreational products and activities since its inception in the s skyline had been more of a tortoise than a hare taking few risks and growing slowly and surefootedly as the company prepared to leave the th century behind it showed no signs of altering that approach because demand in both of skylines major markets was so closely tied to economic cycles it was impossible to predict how the company might fare in the future so long as the general economy remained strong however it seemed likely that skyline would thrive principal subsidiaries skyline homes inc homette corporation layton homes
