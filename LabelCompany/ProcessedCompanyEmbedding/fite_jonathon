recordchronicles facebook page “you cant help getting older but you dont have to get old— comedian george burnsa few weeks ago my business partner and i were asked to present an investment idea at the manual of ideas “wide moat” conference warren buffett introduced the concept of a “wide moat” business years ago  the business whose characteristics are so strong it stands a good chance of fending off the various threats that capitalism brings to bear against it while many folks shy away from the complex pharmaceutical ecosystem we focused on a corner of the market that is fairly easy to understand pharmaceutical distributors jonathon fite  pharmaceutical distributors play behind the scenes in this very large industry there are huge complexities with insurance companies like united healthcare pharmacy benefit managers like express scripts retail pharmacies like cvs and hospitals like hca  let alone the prospects of which drug merck or pfizer will successfully bring to market but nearly all of the prescription drugs sold in the united states go through one of three largest pharma distribution companiessee pharmacies and hospitals don’t actually keep a lot of inventory on hand which if you think about it makes sense given the high cost of prescription drugs the typical hospital or pharmacy relies very strongly on distributors to supply them just in time which is a best practice for good inventory managementif a patient in a hospital for example needs medication odds are that that medicine served to that patient that day made its way from a distribution center to the hospital that very same day distributors are an essential cog in the broader pharmaceutical ecosystemthe pharma industry also benefits from several powerful tailwinds the first is health care innovation that creates more and more new medicines to treat more and more diseases which creates a larger addressable market  on top of this the industry benefits from favorable demographics while many other industries such as consumer products see demographics as a big drag on their earnings the pharmaceutical industry is the opposite it’s really helped by the aging population and baby boomers are entering their peak prescription drug consumption years prescriptions also make up a larger and larger portion of all health care spending and that’s projected to rise further in coming yearswhile the drugmakers insurers and pharmacies all tend to have very high margins distribution businesses have thin operating margins typically less than  percent to survive they must be lean and efficient  on the surface the low margins are not that compelling but some of these distributors generate high returns on capital in other words for every dollar invested in the business they generate a handsome return on that investment the key is the combination of strong cash flows and extreme focus on efficiency when it comes to transportation inventory turnover and warehouse management  one of these businesses in particular caught our eye  in the early s the company traded at roughly  times earnings per share eps  an expensive multiple of earnings investors were clearly expecting lots of growth from the business in the years ahead over the next  years the management team did the hard work of integrating a large merger and smaller tuckin acquisitions while paying down debt resulting in eps growth of nearly  percent over the decade strong growth indeedyet the share price went nowhere the multiple fell from  times eps in the early part of the decade to around  times eps after the financial crisis even though the earnings were much higher investors were paying much less for the future prospects yet over the next six years earnings tripled again and investors finally began to notice  but during the last election cycle the rising burden of health care costs led pharmaceutical companies to become a bit of a punching bag in the political world very aggressive price increases by a variety of pharmaceutical companies such as valeant mylan and its epipen and the infamous martin shkreli who raised the price of his drug by  percent created a series of congressional hearings and a great deal of political scrutiny on the pharma industrybut distribution companies with their razorthin margins would be difficult to label as greedy businesses making abnormal profits they are actually really efficient if you call them anything they are part of the solution for the high cost of health care not part of the problem they are not really a politically sensitive part of the value chainbut other players in the value chain such as pharmaceutical manufacturers may be “overearning” from their vested pricing practices pharmaceutical benefits managers pbms also have much higher margins but less clear valueadd these players might experience margin compression in the years ahead versus the thinmargined distributors who likely would be much less affectedof course amazon could potentially disrupt yet another industry there has been some speculation about amazon wanting to enter the pharmacy arena and this speculation intensified after the announcement of the amazonwhole foods dealbut amazon has been experimenting with grocery sales for many years piloting grocery delivery prior to the whole foods deal there has been much less discussion by amazon on the pharmaceutical front  one aspect to consider here is that pharmaceuticals occupy a very regulated space and amazon’s disruptive success has been in much less regulated or unregulated industries amazon has done less well in highly regulated industries such as alcohol for example   pharmaceuticals have intense regulatory scrutiny because of the presence of narcotic drugs and the importance of not letting drugs escape the inventory chain as a result drugs require much more special handling than the typical distribution center would have if amazon were to enter the space we believe it would not be able to leverage its existing distribution infrastructure but would either have to replicate it or perhaps face a buildversusbuy decision in the distribution segment amazon may choose to focus on other parts of the pharma value chain instead  last month it was reported that amazon was in the process of building its own inhouse pharmacy benefit manager to service its own employees just as amazon did with amazon web services where its inhouse it platform used to service amazon’s retail platform eventually grew to become an external it provider to the broader marketplace an analogy has been drawn that perhaps amazon might grow out its own pharmacy benefit manager and eventually try to serve customers beyond that  this is another reason why we see the pbm space as the part of the overall ecosystem that is most prone to disruption rather than the core distribution segment all of this of course is really guesswork  what we focus on is how the companies we own are exploiting operational financial and macro catalysts to their advantage our current focus is on a company that we believe could double its earnings over the next few years a highquality business trading at a price well below the current market multiple allows us to exploit the fact that we are all getting older  jonathon fite is a managing partner of kmf investments a texasbased hedge fund he is a
