results cassidy v ford motor company may  lance williams defeated certification in a class action against ford motor company  plaintiff attempted to convene a statewide class claiming defects in  ford explorers which allegedly permitted exhaust fumes and other gases into the passenger compartment during operation of the vehicle  after months of litigation on may   united states district judge kurt engelhardt granted ford’s motion to strike plaintiffs’ class action allegations and denied plaintiffs’ motion to certify class bordelon v ford january  on friday january   a jury in orleans parish louisiana returned a verdict for ford motor company following a twoweek trial rejecting plaintiff’s claim that his  ford focus contained a defective seat instead the jury placed all fault for the accident on the adverse driver who rearended the plaintiff’s vehicle the lawsuit arose from a twovehicle accident that occurred on february   at approximately  am in new orleans michael bordelon a coowner of a local restaurant closed the restaurant for the evening and traveled in his focus toward his home  while bordelon was stopped at a controlled intersection willie o’connor driving a toyota tundra rearended him  as a result of the highspeed crash bordelon sustained a severe traumatic brain injury leaving him permanently disabled bordelon subsequently filed suit against willie o’conner and ford motor company as against o’conner bordelon alleged that o’conner negligently rearended him o’conner testified at trial that he had no recollection of the crash because just before the collision he had suffered a “flashback” to his days in vietnam  he also testified that he was not intoxicated despite his having pleaded guilty to dwi fourth offense and first degree vehicular negligent injuring as against ford bordelon claimed the driver’s seat in the  ford focus was unreasonably dangerous because of a defect in design bordelon’s seat expert michael markushewski met of arcca argued the seat back strength was inadequate bordelon’s biomechanical expert brian benda phd also of arcca testified that had ford utilized a stronger seat bordelon would have walked away from the crash without any significant injury in reaching that conclusion benda relied upon an accident reconstruction performed by sean harrington bs in engineering science and mechanics and also from arcca who testified that the tundra was traveling only  mph at the time of the collision ford disputed plaintiff’s accident reconstruction by calling tom perl phd pe of collision safety engineering lc who testified that the tundra traveled  mph at the moment of impact that speed resulted in the focus experiencing a deltav of  mph ford also called a statistician jeya padmanaban ms of jp research inc who explained that the subject crash was more severe than  of all rearend accidents additionally she performed an analysis of hundreds of thousands of crashes and testified that seatback strength is not a statistical predictor of injury outcome ford also presented testimony from roger burnett ms a ford engineer mr burnett explained the design process for the seat and the extensive testing ford undertook during its development finally ford called a biomechanical expert and seat design expert david viano dr med phd of probiomechanics llc who testified that the subject seat design performs very well in rearend crashes in rebutting plaintiff’s claim that ford should have utilized a more rigid seat dr viano introduced testing that demonstrated that the use of the more rigid alternative seat design proposed by plaintiff actually increased the risk of injury to occupants in various crash scenarios experienced much more often than the subject crash scenario and offered no injury reduction benefit even in the serious accident scenario experienced by bordelon turning to damages plaintiff presented the testimony of a psychiatrist richard richoux md and a neuropsychologist kevin bianchini phd as the basis for a life care plan prepared by larry stokes phd that plan included extensive attendant care for bordelon and plaintiff’s economist kenneth boudreaux phd calculated the value of the plan at  to m  in response ford called a psychiatrist john thompson md who disputed the extent of the life care plan presented by plaintiff  ford’s expert in life care plans elizabeth bauer med clcp presented a plan in line with dr thompson’s recommendations and john theriot cpa calculated the present value of ford’s life care plan at  –  during closing arguments plaintiff’s counsel discounted willie o’conner’s role in causing bordelon’s injuries and argued that the jury should cast ford with the majority of the fault apportionment  o’conner’s counsel argued similarly suggesting that o’conner’s fault played no role in the cause of bordelon’s disabling injuries  on the issue of damages plaintiff’s counsel suggested a general damages award from m to m he also asked the jury to award past medicals of approximately  and future medicals of up to m after deliberating for approximately four hours the jury returned an to verdict and found that the ford focus was not defective thereby releasing ford from any liability as for willie o’conner the jury found him  at fault the jury then assessed bordelon’s damages against o’conner and it awarded  in past medical expenses  in future medical expenses and  in general damages for a total award of m ford’s trial team consisted of keith w mcdaniel and quincy t crochet of mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel

verdict for ford motor company following a nearly  week long trial in an airbag non–deployment case involving fatal injuries  in reaching the verdict the jury rejected plaintiff’s allegation that ford defectively designed the supplemental restraint system in a  ford mustang the lawsuit arose out of a series of events on march   that culminated in a twocar collision between a  nissan altima operated by dana shell and a  ford mustang operated by robert brumfield and occupied by his two minor children shell a registered nurse worked the night shift in the psychiatric ward at baton rouge general medical center and her shift ended the morning of march st  according to coworkers shell exhibited odd behavior indicative of impairment and she made numerous nonsensical and illegible chart entries in patients’ records testimony also revealed that a psychiatrist at the hospital mistook shell for a patient that morning and a psychiatric nurse at the facility asked a supervisor to prevent shell from driving away from the hospital nevertheless the hospital excused shell from her next shift and she left the hospital that afternoon in her automobile shortly after leaving shell rearended a pickup truck at highway speed while still in baton rouge she did not stop and the operator of the truck who happened to be a retired baton rouge police officer gave chase he called  and while on the phone with the operator he observed shell commit a second hitandrun on another vehicle shell traveled into the city limits of baker louisiana where two separate baker officers spotted her vehicle activated their lights and sirens and attempted to stop shell however shell continued and ran at least one red light before pulling over approximately  miles after the baker units began their pursuit  baton rouge police officers soon arrived on the scene to handle the initial hitandrun offense and shell completed a written statement  in the statement she identified her location as baton rouge general hospital and wrote that she just hit an alligator in the road  officers from both departments issued various citations to shell but none performed a field sobriety test  after learning that the officers planned to release shell the retired officer and hitandrun victim asked for a head start so that he would not be on the roadway at the same time as shell shell then left baker and continued to operate her vehicle in an erratic fashion forcing at least one other vehicle off the roadway and into a ditch just moments later shell attempted to pass a row of vehicles traveling northbound on highway  near slaughter louisiana while attempting this maneuver shell traveled northbound in the southbound lane of travel and caused an offset headon collision with the brumfields’  ford mustang both vehicles traveled at approximately  mph at the time of the crash  as a result of the impact robert brumfield died immediately at the scene and his two children suffered relatively minor injuries dana shell sustained extensive trauma resulting in approximately  surgical operations robert brumfield’s surviving spouse sunday brumfield subsequently filed suit on behalf of herself and her minor children against dana shell baton rouge general medical center the city of baker the city of baton rouge and ford motor company as against ford plaintiff contended that the wire routing from the driver side airbag sensor was defective plaintiff’s design expert michael nranian of automotive design analysis in south lyon michigan opined that the wire routing rendered the system susceptible to severing during a crash event ford contended that the nondeployment was caused not by faulty wire routing but due to a disconnected airbag diagnostic monitor ford’s design expert michael klima of design research engineering in novi michigan testified that he found the supplemental restraint system’s diagnostic monitor unplugged during an inspection and as a result the system had been disabled  additionally he testified that the separated wire in the engine compartment of the vehicle was pulled apart as a result of tensile loading that developed during the accident long after the front sensors would have closed and sent a signal to deploy the airbags ford’s accident reconstruction expert dr geoffrey germane of germane engineering in provo utah also presented evidence that the diagnostic monitor and nearby wiring components moved several inches rearward during the crash in concert with each other thereby rebutting a suggestion from plaintiff that crush intrusion and relative motion of the components caused the disconnection of diagnostic monitor further dr germane and mr klima testified that any movement of the diagnostic monitor during the crash occurred long after the front sensors signaled for deployment finally ford’s biomechanical expert dr thomas mcnish of biodynamic research corporation in san antonio texas testified that robert brumfield died as a result of a head strike to the apillar and that mr brumfield would have suffered the same fatal injury even with airbag deployment during closing arguments plaintiff’s counsel requested a verdict totaling approximately   after deliberating for approximately  hours the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of ford and awarded nothing to plaintiff ford was represented at trial by keith w mcdaniel quincy t crochet and joshua dierker of  mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel  welch llc and by michael w eady of thompson coe cousins  irons llp   morvant v ford motor company febuary  on friday february   a jury in lake charles louisiana returned a defense verdict for ford motor company following a two week trial in a postcollision fire case rejecting plaintiffs’ allegation that the brake master cylinder and reservoir assembly in decedent william morvant’s  ford f was defectively designed the action arose out of a single vehicle collision in january  when mr morvant drove off the road and into a ditch after drinking at two local bars his vehicle slammed headon into a concrete culvert in the ditch causing its rear end to catapult up over the front end before the vehicle came to rest on its passenger side   a small fire began in the engine compartment and eventually progressed through the windshield and into the passenger cab though an eyewitness to the accident reported she observed no signs of life from mr morvant when she approached the vehicle immediately after the wreck plaintiffs alleged that mr morvant was trapped in the vehicle and “burned alive” decedent’s medical records reflected ongoing treatment for alcoholism and a postmortem blood draw by the medical examiner’s office revealed he had a  bac however the judge ruled that such evidence was inadmissible the judge also excluded evidence that decedent was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the wreck plaintiffs’ experts contended that the polymer brake fluid reservoir in decedent’s f was cracked or dislodged from the master cylinder in the collision allowing brake fluid to escape the reservoir and ignite on the exhaust manifold plaintiffs’ design engineer james mundo opined that the reservoir was defective because it should have been constructed of metal and should also have been ensconced with a bathtublike shield to collect any fluids that may leak from the reservoir during a collision ford contended that the fire was caused not by brake fluid but rather due to the release of power steering fluid onto the exhaust manifold which occurred when the power steering reservoir was smashed against the bulkhead of the vehicle due to the severity of the impact with the culvert plaintiffs made no claim regarding the design of the power steering reservoir jack ridenour ford’s design engineer and fire cause and origin expert testified that the brake fluid reservoir was properly designed and he ran crash testing that confirmed that it was crashworthy and would have survived the impact intact ford’s accident reconstructionist testified to the unique and severe nature of the wreck explaining that frontal collisions followed by pitched rollovers such as occurred in this case represent only  of all collisions additionally ford’s pathologist and biomechanic both testified that mr morvant could not have survived the initial impact and did not “burn alive” plaintiffs sought a total of eleven million dollars – five million dollars in pain and suffering and  million dollars each for mr morvant’s surviving spouse and three adult children ford was represented at trial by keith mcdaniel and lance williams of mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel  welch llc in covington louisiana and by perry miles and lauren wood of mcguirewoods llp in richmond virginia mcnabb v ford motor company march  keith w mcdaniel and quincy t crochet obtained summary judgment for ford motor company in the st judicial district court for the parish of tangipahoa in two separate lawsuits filed by hansford mcnabb and his wife connie mcnabb as a result of a single vehicle accident that occurred on september    according to plaintiffs as hansford mcnabb was driving west on la  in rural tangipahoa parish with his wife connie mcnabb riding as a front seat passenger hansford lost consciousness and their ford f veered off a curve and impacted a tree  connie mcnabb sued her husband and alleged he was at fault for the accident  however connie and hansford also sued ford and alleged that their injuries resulted from the nondeployment of the airbags in the f due to an unspecified manufacturing defect ford pushed plaintiffs for the details of their defect theory and the court ordered the production of liability expert reports but the mcnabbs failed to comply  ford then moved for summary judgment and argued that plaintiffs developed no proof of a defect and that they deprived ford of the ability to inspect the vehicle because they failed to preserve it after the accident  plaintiffs suggested that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied but ford countered that under controlling law res ipsa was inapplicable because the case did not present “highly unusual” circumstances and plaintiffs could not exclude other reasonable causes for the nondeployment – namely that the accident simply did not present forces which surpassed the deployment threshold  after hearing oral argument on the motion the court agreed and dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against ford with prejudice franklin vs ford motor company and jim taylor ford lincoln mercury llc january  keith w mcdaniel and quincy t crochet obtained a defense verdict for ford motor company following a jury trial in lincoln parish louisiana in january   plaintiffs vivian and james franklin brought suit as a result of an alleged inadvertent deployment of the seatmounted driver’s side airbag in a  lincoln ls vivian franklin testified that as she was driving the airbag deployed  she described the road on which she was travelling as “smooth as glass” and she denied hitting any potholes or objects  although she brought the vehicle safely to a stop after the deployment event mrs franklin claimed that the deployment caused multiple cervical and lumbar disc injuries including bulges and an annular tear headaches and chronic pain throughout her body and difficulty with memory vision and hearing  plaintiffs sued ford and alleged that the side airbag system was defective in manufacture design and due to inadequate warnings ford defended the system with data obtained from the diagnostic module of the lincoln ls  the module’s readout confirmed that multiple sensors within the system sensed necessary crash pulses and deployed the airbag  ford also presented evidence to demonstrate that elements of the system’s design were stateoftheart at the time of manufacture that the system conformed with the custom of the industry in design intent that the vehicle complied with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and that the design properly balanced the risk of deployment in noncrash events with the need for deployment in severe side impact scenarios  ford also disputed mrs franklin’s claim regarding the condition of the roadway through the use of dotd records which documented widespread damage in the area of the incident to rebut damages and demonstrate the relatively low level of risk from a deployment in a noncrash environment ford presented the results of a static airbag deployment test in an exemplar lincoln ls with an anthropomorphic test device ie a “test dummy” instrumented with various sensors  the video of the airbag deployment established that the deploying bag moves away from a properly positioned driver  additionally sensors in the dummy’s cervical and lumbar spine areas confirmed that forces acting on the dummy were inconsequential and less than the forces experienced through loading the spine during many activities of daily living  based on these test results ford argued that the subject airbag deployment did not cause mrs franklin’s disc injuries and that the deployment was not the source of her ongoing complaints  instead ford contended that mrs franklin’s disc injuries long predated the airbag incident and that her past medical records document longstanding complaints of the same type she claimed started after the airbag deployment the jury found that plaintiffs failed to establish a product defect under any of the theories advanced pursuant to the louisiana products liability act    reynolds v nissan august  keith w mcdaniel and quincy t crochet obtained summary judgment in favor of nissan north america inc in a lawsuit filed by richard reynolds in the nd judicial district court for the parish of st tammany  the case arose out of a five car accident which occurred on louisiana hwy  in mandeville louisiana in march   after initially sideswiping a honda accord the intoxicated operator of a chevrolet suburban collided with the rear left side of the plaintiff’s  infiniti g  the impact caused the g to collide with another car before coming to a rest off the roadway in a ditch  meanwhile the driver of the suburban continued and collided with several other vehicles mr reynolds who sustained personal injuries in the accident later filed suit against his insurance carrier an automobile auction company nissan and the operator of the suburban  as against nissan reynolds alleged that his injuries were caused by unspecified defects in the vehicle’s supplemental restraint system  to support his claim reynolds retained an expert dr claude r mount  however nissan successfully moved to exclude dr mount from trial on the basis that dr mount lacks the experience to testify as an expert in supplemental restraint system performance nissan subsequently moved for summary judgment  nissan argued that reynolds lacked expert support for his defect claims  further despite years of litigation reynolds failed to develop or present any proof of a manufacturing defect a design defect a warnings defect or a warranty defect pursuant to the louisiana products liability act  the trial court agreed and granted nissan’s motion dismissing it from the suit in august  jack b harper contractor inc v united fiberglass of america inc february  keith w mcdaniel quincy t crochet and heather m nagel of mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel  welch llc obtained a favorable result for prime conduit inc “pci” following a nearly threeweek jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana  jack b harper contractor inc “harper” filed the lawsuit against united fiberglass of america inc “ufa” and pci and alleged defects in a multicell conduit system referred to as multigard  prior to suit harper entered a contract with the louisiana department of transportation and development for the installation of digital messaging signs cameras and radar along with underground and structuremounted conduit to house the power cable and fiber optic cable which serviced and powered the equipment  harper purchased and installed multigard for use on elevated portions of interstates  and  near new orleans louisiana  ufa and pci each manufactured certain components of the conduit system which harper argued was defective and caused delayed completion of the project  the case proceeded to trial before a jury with judge jane trichemilazzo presiding  pci defended harper’s claims rejecting the notion that the conduit was defective and arguing instead that any issues encountered by harper were due to faulty installation techniques  in closing counsel for harper asked the jury to cast pci with  fault and ufa with  fault and to award damages totaling almost five million dollars  however the jury rejected harper’s request and determined instead that pci was only  at fault  the jury placed the majority of the fault on harper at  with the remaining  fault assessed against ufa  the jury also determined that harper’s damages totaled less than two million dollars  after applying the fault percentages fixed by the jury the court entered judgment in harper’s favor against pci for  a figure which represents less than  of the amount requested by harper during closing arguments michael r duncan v ford motor company june  plaintiff sued ford motor company alleging the failure of his vehicle’s airbag to deploy in an accident caused his injuries keith mcdaniel successfully obtained summary judgment in the trial court on june   the louisiana first circuit court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment providing written reasons read decision weiss v mazda november  the louisiana fifth circuit court of appeal has upheld a grant of summary judgment for mazda motor of america inc and royal oldsmobile company inc the opinion can be found at httpwwwfifthcircuitorgopinionsaspx by searching for case no ca lance b williams and quincy t crochet of mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel  welch llc obtained the judgment for mazda and royal in march of  in the case of elizabeth l weiss and john weiss v mazda motor corp et al in the th judicial district for the parish of jefferson case no  the plaintiffs filed the product liability action seeking damages against mazda and royal for injuries allegedly sustained when the airbag deployed after elizabeth weiss struck a parked vehicle in her  mazda mx in metairie louisiana the plaintiffs claimed that the impact was minor and at an offset angle and thus the airbags should not have deployed they alleged that the supplemental restraint system was defective in design and for failure to provide adequate warnings the summary judgment argued that plaintiffs had failed to develop any evidence to prove that the vehicle was defective pursuant to the louisiana product liability act and absent expert support all claims should be dismissed judge william “chuck” credo iii agreed and granted the defendants’ motion on march   in his written reasons judge credo explained that “mazda provided adequate warnings regarding the activation and any potential dangers associated with airbag deployment” the plaintiffs subsequently appealed the dismissal of their claim to the louisiana fifth circuit court of appeal the appellate court determined that mazda adequately warned the plaintiffs that the air bags could deploy in a frontal or near frontal accident of moderate impact and that mr  mrs weiss failed to produce any evidence that the subject accident resulted in less than a moderate impact thus the plaintiffs were unable to establish proximate cause in addition the fifth circuit determined that the only proposed alternative warning presented by the plaintiffs’ counsel would be inapplicable to the subject accident after noting that a plaintiff prosecuting a failure to warn claim cannot prevail based on a mere allegation of inadequacy the fifth circuit affirmed the ruling of the trial court and upheld the summary judgment in favor of mazda and royal duncan v ford motor company et al march  keith w mcdaniel prevailed on a motion for summary judgment which was granted in favor of ford motor company the twovehicle accident at issue occurred in  however plaintiff failed to preserve the subject  ford taurus the most critical piece of evidence in the case the court ruled that plaintiff failed to carry his burden in proving that the ford taurus was defective under the exclusive theories of liability found in the louisiana product liability act lsa rs  on january   plaintiff michael duncan was operating his  ford taurus in baton rouge louisiana when he was involved in a headon collision plaintiff alleged that the air bag of the ford taurus failed to deploy during the collision causing him to suffer severe injuries to his legs head and mouth duncan initiated the lawsuit in the th judicial district court for the parish of east baton rouge on january   ford subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that duncan failed to present any evidence that his damages were caused by any alleged defect in the ford vehicle made the basis of his claims and that duncan would be unable to develop such evidence because of his destruction of the subject vehicle duncan responded that although direct evidence of a manufacturing defect did not exist res ipsa loquitur applied establishing his burden of proof after the presentation of the facts evidence and oral arguments the court concluded that plaintiff failed to take the necessary steps to preserve the  ford taurus furthermore the court concluded that plaintiff failed to carry his burden of proving that the ford taurus was unreasonably dangerous or that any unreasonably dangerous or defective condition in it caused plaintiff’s injuries accordingly the court held that duncan had not produced sufficient evidence to support his claim of a manufacturing defect and rejected plaintiff’s application of the evidentiary doctrine of res ipsa loquitur martin edgar et al v ford motor company et al february  keith w mcdaniel lance b williams and quincy t crochet of mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel  welch obtained a summary judgment for ford motor company in the case of martin edgar et al v ford motor company et al  wl  sd ind  the single vehicle accident at issue occurred on december   on interstate  in central louisiana the six plaintiffs were the occupants of a  ford explorer involved in a rollover after martin edgar lost control of the vehicle after its firestone tire lost its tread as a result of the accident mr edgar suffered a cervical fracture and the remaining occupants sustained various injuries all six occupants of the fivepassenger explorer filed suit against ford and firestone in the th judicial district court for the parish of st landry the case was removed to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana and then transferred to the bridgestonefirestone multi district litigation pending in the southern district of indiana after more than two years of litigation ford moved for summary judgment and argued that the plaintiffs had not carried their burden under the louisiana product liability act for establishing a defect in the vehicle the district judge granted the motion noting that plaintiffs had not participated appropriately in the discovery process and had not satisfied a previous award of costs and attorney fees in favor of ford the plaintiffs attempted to salvage their case by retaining experts and offering reports after the deadline to do so had long passed the court granted ford’s motion to strike the tardy expert opinions and held that plaintiffs had failed to provide any evidence of any defect accordingly ford’s motion for summary judgment was granted kimberly creel v ford motor company july  keith w mcdaniel lance b williams and quincy t crochet prevailed on a motion for summary judgment which was granted in favor of ford motor company the singlevehicle accident at issue occurred in  but plaintiff did not file a lawsuit until more than twoandahalf years later the court rejected plaintiff’s argument that the doctrine of contra non valentem should apply and dismissed her claims as prescribed pursuant to louisiana’s one year liberative prescriptive period kimberly creel v bridgestonefirestone inc et al  wl  sd ind  plaintiff kimberly creel was operating her  ford explorer on august   in louisiana while traveling to texas she alleged that a tire on the vehicle failed causing her to lose control of the vehicle and subsequently roll over on may   nearly three years after the accident creel joined a multiplaintiff action filed in jefferson county mississippi after nearly six years of litigation the mississippi supreme court found that mississippi lacked jurisdiction over creel’s claims and her case was dismissed creel v bridgestonefirestone north american tire llc et al  so d  miss  creel then initiated a new lawsuit in the th judicial district court for the parish of webster on april   nearly nine years after the accident the matter was removed to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana and was then transferred to the bridgestonefirestone multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of indiana ford subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that creel’s claims were prescribed or timebarred under louisiana’s one year liberative prescription period creel argued in opposition that contra non valentem applied however after reviewing the evidence the court concluded that it is “clear that plaintiff failed to take the necessary steps to determine the cause of the tire failure and the resultant accident and her injuries  ” the court noted that the police report provided that the vehicle suffered a “blow out” that plaintiff testified she informed the investigating officer that the vehicle suffered a blown tire that plaintiff was told by the police officer and witnesses that the accident was not her fault that the plaintiff believed the tire failure caused her to lose control of the explorer and that she knew who manufactured her vehicle and tire accordingly the court held that creel had sufficient information to provide a basis for a lawsuit or further investigation following the accident and rejected the proposed application of contra non valentem dimaggio v ford motor company february  mccranie sistrunk attorneys obtained a defense verdict for ford motor company in a two week jury trial arising from the death of two people in a rollover accident involving a ford explorer plaintiffs claimed that explorers manufactured

dewright peters v nissan forklift corporation march  keith w mcdaniel lance b williams and quincy crochet of mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel  welch in new orleans louisiana obtained a unanimous defense verdict in a case tried to a federal court jury in new orleans the suit arose from a workplace accident in which the plaintiff mr peters crushed his foot while operating a walkierider pallet jack at a walmart distribution center in the accident mr peters who was  years old crushed nearly every bone in his foot and has since undergone  surgeries he claimed total and permanent disability from future employment plaintiff asked the jury for  million in damages plaintiff claimed nissan failed to provide a safe design for the pallet jack contending that the operator’s platform was too small and there should have been additional measures taken to prevent a rider from falling or becoming dislodged from the platform alternatively plaintiff argued that the subject pallet jack’s endcontrol design should be replaced with a centercontrol design because of the added protection provided to operators finally plaintiff alleged that nissan failed to provide sufficient warnings of the dangers associated with operating the pallet jack in the rider mode nissan responded by demonstrating the dearth of similar incidents with a design which had been on the market for decades the pallet jack further conformed to all relevant industry and governmental standards regarding plaintiff’s design alternatives nissan argued that the utility of the product as an orderpicker in distribution centers would be severely handicapped if plaintiff’s design changes were implemented the centerrider pallet jack which was offered by nissan as well as many other manufacturers had a different utility and the decision for which design best met a consumer’s needs was ultimately a decision for the customer especially considering the sophistication of walmart nissan responded to the warnings claims with evidence of the warnings provided by nissan as well as the extensive threeday training program utilized by walmart finally evidence was presented that mr peters was not properly operating the product at the time of the accident causing him to lose his balance and allowing his foot to come between the pallet jack and a concrete post plaintiff’s experts were thomas berry of wichita kansas and andy mcphate of baton rouge louisiana for design issues dennis seal of dallas texas testified regarding warnings nissan’s experts were john johnson of gresham oregon on design and alan dorris phd of atlanta georgia on warningshuman factors nissan crashworthiness and brake defect claim daphne leray et al v nissan north america inc et al after a threeweek trial a louisiana state court jury returned a verdict for nissan north america inc finding no defect in the crashworthiness or braking system of a  nissan pickup daphne leray et al v nissan north america inc et al th jdc no  verdict rendered september   update the verdict was overturned on unrelated grounds and a new trial has been ordered plaintiff daphne leray was a front seat passenger in a  pick up driven by her boyfriend jamie adams while traveling on a two lane road outside of thibodaux louisiana mr adams allowed the vehicle to drift off the roadway onto the gravel shoulder on the right before overcorrecting to the left losing control and skidding across the roadway into a ditch on the left side of the highway his vehicle rolled and vaulted into a telephone pole with the passenger side apillar making the first contact with the pole daphne leray was rendered quadriplegic while jamie adams walked away virtually unscathed ms leray sued nissan north america inc alleging that the vehicle’s brake system was defectively designed because it provided only rear wheel antilock brakes rather than fourwheel antilock brakes the plaintiff also alleged that the “roof structure” of the vehicle was inadequate and should have been designed to withstand the force of the impact with the pole plaintiff also sued the state of louisiana for a defective roadway and entergy louisiana llc for the placement of the pole in an unusual twist plaintiff also sued her initial treating doctors in a separate lawsuit claiming that they failed to properly safeguard her cervical spine allowing her to be without cervical protection for three days before diagnosing spinal fractures and a spinal cord injury that suit went to trial in jefferson parish louisiana in  resulting in an  million verdict against the doctors because of statutory caps to recovery in medical malpractice litigation in louisiana plaintiffs received approximately  million in cash as well as reimbursement for all future medicals from the doctors due to pretrial rulings however nissan was forced to present the fault and damages caused by the doctors which plaintiffs denied in the second litigation nissan defended the brake defect allegations by demonstrating that jamie adams failed to apply any steering input to the vehicle as it skidded across the roadway and into the ditch front wheel abs systems although designed to allow for steering for heavy braking would have provided no benefit in leray’s accident because no steering was incorporated additionally nissan defended its selection of rear wheel only abs systems in the early s as stateoftheart and appropriate to remedy rearwheel lockup common in pickups regarding the crashworthiness claims nissan demonstrated that the vehicle impacted the pole with the passenger side apillar and the vehicle upside down at between  and  mph nissan asserted that plaintiffs’ expert keith friedman was unable to provide a vehicle in production which would have withstood the localized forces exerted on the nissan’s apillar and therefore nissan successfully argued that the design necessary to withstand such forces was not and is not available in passenger vehicles nissan also conducted testing in which various  model year vehicles were dropped at  mph onto their apillar against an elevated pole the damage seen by other vehicles was consistent with or worse than the damage sustained by the nissan nissan also rebutted the finite element analysis modeling conducted by mr friedman which was intended to demonstrate feasible alternative designs instead nissan presented evidence to show that the modeling was inaccurate and scientifically unsound plaintiffs’ sought approximately  million in damages legal interest would have raised the total to nearly  million the jury returned a verdict holding jamie adams  at fault and each of the two doctors  at fault plaintiffs experts were keith friedman and murat okcouglu from friedman research and anthony

mitsubishi after two years of appeals on january   kelli lawson was driving her  mitsubishi galant when she stopped the vehicle and honked her horn upon honking her horn the airbag deployed breaking both of her thumbs and injuring her right wrist ms lawson then underwent several surgeries and therapy and claimed at trial to be permanently disabled from her job as a court clerk she filed suit on june   against mitsubishi motor sales of america inc alleging a manufacturing defect in the clockspring a component which routes electrical wires to the airbag and other devices in the steering wheel a jury trial was conducted from september   through october   and a twelve person jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of mitsubishi thereafter the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion for jnov on liability and ordered a new trial on damages the matter was appealed and the louisiana third circuit court of appeal affirmed the jnov and rendered damages in excess of  the louisiana supreme court granted writs and reversed the third circuit’s and trial court’s rulings reinstating the jury verdict the louisiana supreme court held that the lower courts improperly applied the evidentiary doctrine of res ipsa loquitur latin for athe thing speaks for itself the court further determined that the lower courts’ misapplication of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur erroneously made it adispositive of the issue of defendant’s negligence the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is in actuality purely an evidentiary doctrine and does not carry plaintiffs’ burden of proof rather it shifts the burden to defendants to prove that the malfunction was not a result of a defect in manufacture the court found initially that the doctrine should not have been used in the subject case louisiana law holds that res ipsa loquitur should only apply in instances where the evidence sufficiently aexcluded inference of the plaintiffs’ own responsibility or the responsibility of others besides defendant in causing the accident the court noted that mitsubishi proved at trial there had never been another reported instance of a clockspring malfunctioning because of a misalignment at the factory further plaintiffs’ own experts could not verify with direct evidence the fact that the cause of the malfunction was a misalignment of the component by mitsubishi rather than in subsequent repairs or accidents noting that the vehicle had been in a rental fleet for  miles the court also noted that plaintiffs’ experts destroyed any adirect evidence by dismantling the steering wheel and airbag system before any notice was provided to mitsubishi in doing so plaintiffs’ experts failed to adequately document the condition of the components accordingly the court ruled that plaintiffs should not be allowed to gain the benefit of circumstantial evidence when they defeated the only possible direct evidence available – the alignment of the clockspring thompson v nissan louisiana federal court judge grants summary judgment to nissan in fire case april  a federal judge in new orleans louisiana granted summary judgment on claims that the fuel system in a  nissan pathfinder contained design and warnings defects leonard thompson et al v nissan north america inc et al ed la no  on january   betty segura was driving a  nissan pathfinder with five relatives as passengers due to an alleged deflation of the left rear tire ms segura lost control of the vehicle which flipped and landed on its roof on a bridge over lake pontchartrain a large amount of fuel spilled from the vehicle’s fuel filler tube and ignited during the crash ms segura and three of the passengers perished the other two passengers survived but leonard thompson sustained third degree burns over a large portion of his body including disfiguring burns to his head and face after the accident the fire department personnel who responded to the scene observed that the fuel filler door to the vehicle was closed but inside there was no evidence of a fuel filler cap having been in place prior to the fire plaintiffs retained jerry wallingford and thomas green who opined that the fuel system of the  nissan pathfinder was defectively designed additionally plaintiffs’ experts alleged that nissan failed to provide an adequate warning of the dangers associated with an improperly tightened or misplaced fuel filler cap specifically plaintiffs’ experts conducted testing to show the amount of fuel which is released through the filler tube when a vehicle is inverted and the gas cap is not in place they then alleged that nissan should have implemented alternative designs which would have prevented the leakage of fuel from the filler tube if the vehicle was inverted and the gas cap was misplaced nissan’s fuel system design expert mark noble testified that all of the alternative designs suggested by plaintiffs were not in existence at the time of the design of the  nissan pathfinder further mr noble tested the alternative designs suggested by plaintiffs and demonstrated that each would have defeated the utility of the vehicle specifically one alternative could not be fitted to the gas tank of the pathfinder without significant design and structural changes to the vehicle itself all of the suggested alternative designs prevented proper pressure equalization in the tank during filling the tank at a commercial filling station therefore it was shown that none of the alternative designs allowed the tank to be filled at a commercial filling station and any attempt to fill the tank produced excessive “spitback” of fuel out of the tank and onto the customer judge a j mcnamara after reviewing the evidence determined that the alternative designs were not feasible as required by the louisiana product liability act additionally the court conducted a costbenefit analysis and determined that the utility of the vehicle was so diminished by the alternative designs that this cost far outweighed the benefit associated with implementing the alternative designs the court noted that plaintiffs’ experts could produce no other known instance of a vehicle rolling over with a misplaced gas cap resulting in spillage of fuel out of the fuel filler tube and causing a fire with regard to plaintiffs’ warning claims plaintiffs’ experts failed to provide an alternative warning which if implemented would have prevented the accident or plaintiffs’ injuries leonard thompson was the individual who last filled the gas tank he testified that he replaced and “tightened” the gas cap all the way therefore the court concluded he needed no warning of the dangers associated with failing to tighten or replace the gas cap as plaintiffs’ experts suggested nissan north america inc was represented by keith w mcdaniel and lance b williams of mccranie sistrunk anzelmo hardy mcdaniel  welch in covington louisiana johnny williams v ford motor company january  mccranie sistrunk attorneys

failure to comply with an express warranty ie that the airbag would deploy under similar circumstances plaintiff presented a biomechanical expert to support her claim that her injuries were the result of the failure of the airbag to deploy those claims were rebutted by ford’s design and biomechanical experts who demonstrated that the forces were insufficient for the airbag to deploy and that
