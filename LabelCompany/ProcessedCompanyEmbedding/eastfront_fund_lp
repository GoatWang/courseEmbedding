platforms pc tablets smartphones and boardgames the kickstarter campaign started october th   link httpswwwkickstartercomprojectswawwarsacrosstheworwaw has a unique game concept and system that allows to recreate with one rule all types of conflict that occured from prehistorical times to our days with traditional warfare and assymetrical conflicts waw will be released in spring  with a first collection of at least  titles for the first yearan ingame editor will be included with the pc version to edit all the game elements video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvovsnyqwoni facebook page httpswwwfacebookcomwawstrategiaepresentation by one of the authors httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxbtoyslcpa website with all information httpwwwwawgamescomthe game concept is detailed here httpdirectwawgamescomleconceptwawhow to simulate all conflicts of mankind with a single game system many feel it is not possible but the games we have actually made show it is the base rules in the waw enginesystem allow to recreate military operations at the general and common level movement management stacking combats income supply production etc… those rules works all the time and do not need to be learnt over and over so the learning curve is rather flat and fast for modern wars air rules and armor warfare are also generic although obviously made off in games scenarios before the modern era then each scenario has a set of limited specific rules that will fit with the time period or environment played all the games events in a scenario are unique and assigned to each of the player and leaders and combat or support units are also unique for each side or the nations making one side example  you can attack only with stacks with leaders except for sieges and navalair war so managing leaders are crucial and they are not so many their combat values affect battle dices their morale values affect the battle outcome by influencing the number of sustainable hits example  continued combat works by having each unit in a stack roll a ‘dice’ and score equal panic inflicted or less hit inflicted than their combat value this roll is modified by leader’s combat difference if any terrain modifiers supports air artillery and some event cards played during the battle…panicked unit no longer fight in a second round but will suffer pursuit losses hit unit lose one step number of hits influenced by armyleader morale values and possibly cards play determine who wins or loses a scenario example in the game normandy  movement supply combat and production all use the generic waw rules and then we have extra rules for german bunkers mulberries railroad sabotage the bocage naval support and the air rules generic are also active unique events are treated using some of the generic rules and some specific ones and we have scripted events likes operation perch german panzer ace wittmann dukw straffing of rommel’s vehicle french resistance etc… among the units the us th or th infantry divisions the th german id or the nd ss panzerdivision the th canadian armored b bombers luftwaffe land units paratroops… all using a system of standard attackdefense value morale value movement value and special combat types…all of which are generic rules in the system leaders like the americans gerow or cook dempsey or ritchie for the british or the germans like dollmannn or rommel and many others… here again using the combat value morale value etc…as per the system generic rules yes one rule covers  of all instances and in such a way the same system will be extremely familiar to players…and then each scenariogame will be unique because the look the feel the content the custom and special rules and cards will lend it a special and original flavour         last edited

something fresh like they did with eastfrontbecause of that i think worthington has surpassed them their games are fresh from game to game prussias defiant used a really cool combat system and card play caesars gallic war added a hermanstyle card driven element now they have been on a roll the holdfast games are gamechangers the american revolution games are a lot of fun wilderness empires is a really sharp looking game all of these games use different systems yet keep the rules really short the civil war games appear to be using another system different from the others but designed for the civil waras a second opinion i would say it depends it used to be the case that any game from columbia was an autobuy but theyve had a lot more uneven performance lately its only a theory but i think some of it has to do with their embracing kickstarter in a couple of cases i think they have rushed development and made some poor decisions because of kickstarter deadlines and stretch goals that altered the games and left them with significant errata and play issues needing further postpublication adjustment as for worthington i think some of the games are fine but ive been disappointed by a couple as well as block games tend to be expensive its a tough call whether to get swept up in the kickstarter frenzy or to wait for market feedback and be sure im tending to let the kickstarters go by more and more even if i will miss some fancy component upgrade or whatever         last edited sat oct    pm total number of edits  posted sat oct    pm quickreply   quickquote   reply   quote  dice rolls etien smic united statesthibodauxlouisiana peloton thrill of the race there is a thread or two here and there about what you want or expect in a wargame or what improvements do you see in the future for wargames something like that well one comment that has arisen was the quality of game boxes we all understand that better quality components means higher game costs i like worthington games and own several but i must say that the game boxes for holdfast russia  and holdfast korea  are some of the flimsiness in my collection and these games were not cheap i am so afraid of the structural weakness of the boxes that i cannot stack them except on top    of a sturdy gmt game box or an old ah bookcase gameto be fair columbias box quality has dropped significantly from the old gamma two editions to the point that i do not care for them but they are still more durable than the two games i have already mentioned         posted sat oct    pm quickreply   quickquote   reply

comeback tale the atrocious rules the designer literally saying on the forum play it this way until i hear back from someone at columbia seems to indicate that the right and left hands do not know what they are doing not inspiring purely conjecture on my part but i would hazard a guess they rushed ks production of victory in europe simply to get it out before craigs triumph  tragedy which they knew would be arriving soon due to p numbers and product updates from the rule book alone tt does what vie wanted to do so much better and yes to be fair tt is not perfect and has its bit of errata

quote  dice rolls tom stearns gohrns united stateshoustontexas speaking of components worthington games is not a company im rushing out to purchase from prussias defiant stand had a really good sturdy box the game was interesting and though i sold it i would like to reaquire it my complaint is component quality i hate repeat i hate the cut and fold cardboard maps give me paper or give me mounted but please stop with the cardboard hearts and minds vietnam is the only current worthington game i own and im selling it the box is so flimsy and easily suffers damage it has the aweful cardboard map and thin flimsy cards the counters are fine quality wise but graphically are nothing to write home about when i see the preorder prices for their new stuff i just cannot commit to that ill be watching for vance and duke to share their thoughts about the new stuff once they get things opened and played until then though color me cautious         posted sun nov    pm quickreply   quickquote   reply   quote  dice rolls peter collins peteywa canadaprince rupertbritish columbia wow a lot of feedback therei havent pulled the trigger on any of columbias kickstarters though napoleon was tempting i agree with judd it would be nice to see them do something new with the genre nevertheless they have a solid catalog all still in print except for pacific victory which would be a perfect candidate for a groundbreaking new treatment imhoone correction gamma is columbia tom dalgliesh ran both i speculate that he formed columbia when he moved from the vancouver area to blaine washington gamma was a canadian company and columbia is american just guessing heres a bit of the storyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicolumbiagamesas for worthington other than the acw offering i havent seen anything thats has

due to p numbers and product updates from the rule book alone tt does what vie wanted to do so much betteryes the rules of victory in europe as published were poorly written but version  came out soon afterwards and those rules are fine  theyve cleared up most of the ambiguities vie was certainly not rushed out  it was several months from the end of the ks campaign to the game being published if anything people were impatient for the game to reach them though personally id rather wait a bit longer if it means a better game having said this gmt is trying even my patience with won by the sword more than a year after publication and were still waiting for the various issues to be resolved and waiting a long time is not a guarantee of a great game  i still remember the interminable wait for mmps kingdom of heaven which didnt quite deliver what id been expectingi think that tt is a significantly different game to vie  apart from the theme and the use of blocks there is not much similarity tt is a relatively quickplaying player game with a mix of military and other aspects diplomatic technological indeed ive had a game of tt with hardly any conflict due to a surprise attack by the germans inflicting a rapid military defeat on the soviets vie is essentially player much longer more involved and focuses on the military         posted mon nov    am quickreply   quickquote   reply
