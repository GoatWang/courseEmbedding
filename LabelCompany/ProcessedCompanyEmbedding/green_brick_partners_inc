brooklyn investor green brick partners inc grbk the brooklyn investor random thoughts on investing and investment ideas tuesday february   green brick partners inc grbk so heres an interesting situation  some people just have a knack for getting out of bad situations  i remember when leucadia got out of their wiltel  it was a disaster but they got out at breakeven and walked away with a big tax asset  it sort of reminds me of a silent movie scene where chaplin or keaton walks away and a grand piano crashes onto the sidewalk where they stood only moments before and heres einhorns great escape biofuel energy corp greenlight and third point are both listed as large shareholders in the original s in  so were preipo investors along with cargill of the original biofuel energy anyway this has been a disaster going from an ipo price of  down to less than  in a year and then to  not soon after that there was a  reverse split in  greenlight owned around  million shares after the ipo valuing the stake at  million  i dont know what his cost was  million of the shares had a cost basis of share  million were bought on a concurrent private offering on the ipo so presumably cost  and i dont know what the class b shares cost   there was a rights offering at share in  where i think greenlight spent  million or so bringing up shares owned to  million   and then there was a  reverse split bringing shares owned by greenlight to  million shares anyway adjusting for the  reverse split the share cost translates to share  the  ipo price becomes  and the share they paid for more shares in the  rights offering translates to share to the comparable current price of  so on this basis its hard to say that greenlight is going to walk away from this at break even anyway this deal happened at around the time pacific ethanol peix was soaring bill gates investment company was an investor   i looked at it then but wondered why it was such a great business both input and output prices were beyond their control and there clearly was no moat at all not to mention some very smart people saying what a stupid idea using ethanol for energy was for greenlightthird point the plan was probably to just build some ethanol plants and flip them to the public which they did successfully up to there either way its a tiny position for these guys  it was a nice punt on a popular theme at the time heres a description of biofuels business from one of their filings biofuel energy corpbiofuel energy corp was incorporated as a delaware corporation on april   to invest solely in biofuel energy llc the “llc” a limited liability company organized on january   to build and operate ethanol production facilities in the midwestern united states from june  through november   the company operated two ethanol production facilities located in wood river nebraska and fairmont minnesota that produced and sold ethanol and its related coproducts the company’s ethanol plants were owned and operated by the operating subsidiaries of the llc which were party to a credit agreement the “senior debt facility” with a group of lenders substantially all of the assets of the operating subsidiaries were pledged as collateral under the senior debt facility on november   the company’s ethanol plants and all related assets were transferred to certain designees of the lenders in full satisfaction of all outstanding obligations under the senior debt facility following the disposition of the ethanol production facilities we are a holding company with no substantial operations of our own our headquarters are located in denver colorado  at june   the company retained approximately  million in cash and cash equivalents as of june   the company also retained federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards in the amount of approximately  million which have been fully reserved against biof basically became a shell company with a tax asset and some cash and they got a delisting notice from nasdaq and heres the company that it bought owned mostly by greenlight jbgl jbgl is a real estate operator involved in the purchase and development of land for residential use construction lending and home building operations jbgl capital lp and jbgl builder finance llc were each formed under the laws of the state of delaware jbgl capital lp was formed in  and jbgl builder finance llc was formed in  affiliates of greenlight provided a majority of the initial capital for both entities with the brickman parties providing the remaining capital  jbgl capital its land development business and jbgl builder finance its builder operations business and their affiliates are engaged in all aspects of the homebuilding process including land acquisition and development entitlements design construction marketing and sales of various residential projects in master planned communities primarily in the highgrowth metropolitan areas of dallas and fort worth texas “dfw” and atlanta georgia  jbgl currently owns or controls approximately  home sites in prime locations in the dfw and atlanta markets jbgl considers prime locations to be supply constrained lots with high housing demand and where much of the surrounding property has already been developed jbgl management believes that it is a leading land developer in its markets jbgl develops lots for both public company builders and large privately held builders jbgl also owns  controlling interests in several builders and provides construction financing for approximately  homes annually the purchase price was  million  million in cash partly funded by a  million loan from greenlight and  million from their rights offering and  million shares of stock priced at share   after all is said and done greenlight owns  of grbk    the value of grbk is up but most of that increase in value came from the rights offering and new stock issued to greenlight jbgl was basically funded by greenlight to invest in the real estate business in  to take advantage of a distressed industry  it is run by james brickman a longtime friend of einhorn james r brickman — mr brickman is the founding manager and advisor of each of jbgl capital lp since  and jbgl builder finance llc since  mr brickman is responsible for all major investment decisions capital allocation strategic planning and relationships with jbgl’s builders and lead investor prior

my family owns  of the equity of great brick partners  over the last couple of weeks i’ve received a few questions regarding differences in my ownership percentage in sec filings compared to the   that is due to some of my family’s ownership being held in the names of my adult children  our family in total still owns   our goal is to provide superior riskadjusted returns to our shareholders  we will accomplish this by focusing on the longterm and not giving too much weight to nearterm financial results  analysts wanting to see a smooth linear progression of gaap earnings quartertoquarter may be disappointed  for example about  of our assets or  million is invested in two large neighborhoods that have been under planning and development for two years and have not yet produced any revenue  we anticipate that both these neighborhoods will come online in   our business model is different than most large public builders  we are a land development company that also buys controlling interest in local builders and we make profits in three ways  first most of our lots are not owned by our local builders but by green brick  green brick sells lots to these builders at high rates of return  second green brick makes first lien construction loans at above market interest rates to our builders  if our builders can turn their inventory efficiently their interest cost as a percent of revenue is approximately  which is still typical of most public builders  green brick should make a midteen unleveraged return on equity before profit sharing with our builders  third we do receive profit on lot sales and loans before a builder receives any profit  because our builders share the last residual tranche of profit in other words sale proceeds from a home our builders are highly motivated to operate efficiently and later he elaborates first we believe we operate in two of the best housing markets in the country  dallas has the best job growth in the country and atlanta is the sixth best  we believe that both of our markets are staged for significant growth  large corporations such as toyota and state farm are relocating their national headquarters near where we own most of our dallas lots  we evaluate every geographical area continuously but we will not expand into new markets unless we believe they will provide significant future value for our shareholders     second we have some of the best prime lots in supply constrained submarkets in dallas and atlanta  two of our largest investments have been in the planning and development process for about two years  we anticipate that the village of twin creeks in allen texas and bellmoore park in johns creek georgia will deliver their first homes in  but will not be big contributors to our operating results until the second half of the year  to learn more about these neighborhoods please visit our website at greenbrickpartnerscom     three for our strong operating partners real estate is a very local business  we aim to find the very best builders in every geography we enter and we have awardwinning operating partners in the dallas and atlanta regions that have been in the business in those markets for decades  we help our builders with strategic land purchases product design capital allocation and planning but we leave the daytoday operations to our builders     four we aim to build a better product and offer it at a fair price to our customers  we offer niche product designs in both atlanta and dallas that appeal to downsizing homeowners and younger professionals but stay in the affordable range of  to  with most of our product line  our historical results show that our strategy has been successful and we will continue to refine it as we move to open even larger planned communities that we’ve just discussed   tax asset and heres the tax part of all of this biof  deferred tax asset as of june   the company had a  million deferred tax asset related to its nols for accounting purposes a valuation allowance is required to reduce a deferred tax asset if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income the company’s financial statements currently provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset due to the company’s historical operating losses and in accordance with applicable guidance in connection with the preparation of the pro forma financial statements we have not adjusted this valuation allowance as a result the deferred tax asset is not set forth on our historical or pro forma balance sheet  the nols do not begin to expire until  our ability to utilize our nols will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods based on jbgl’s  and yeartodate  taxable income results management expects that jbgl should generate sufficient taxable income to utilize substantially all of the nols before they expire the company will evaluate the appropriateness of a valuation allowance in future periods based on the consideration of all available evidence including the generation of taxable income using the more likely than not standard since jbgl netted  million in  this dta should be utilized   maybe they reverse the valuation allowance soon  this would add around share to the bps of grbk   of course this is an undiscounted figure  if you assume that they can use up the dtas in six years you can give it a  discount using a  discount rate in that case the dta would be worth share  book value per share so what is grbk worth  from the september  prospectus the pro forma tangible book value per share was around share   but this was based on certain assumptions about the price of biof stock on or around the closing date   theres a reason i posted this whole section below  from the prospectus dated september   the following table sets forth the accretion calculations as of june     biofuel energy corp actualpro forma combined   in thousands except per share amounts tangible assets tangible liabilities   net tangible assets divided by shares outstanding net tangible book

biofuel energy corp stockholders’ equity  noncontrolling interest h  total equity  total liabilities and equity  you will notice that the book value per share is calculated by using total equity of  million  usually to calculate bps you would not include noncontrolling interest  it is included sometimes in these offering documents because what was noncontrolling interest before the deal might be converted intoor assumed to be common postdeal thats the case with say shak  but here i couldnt find any explanation  jblg announced q earnings and there is another proforma balance sheet as of

equity total liabilities and equity using the updated total equity amount of  million and the same method used in the prospectus so dont blame me for including noncontrolling interest bps would be share    adding back the share in dta would give us bps of share or using a discounted share dta would give us a bps of share  that gives us a valuation of x or x bps in the merger proxy there is a valuation analysis of comps which is always fun to look at  selected public companies analysis duff amp phelps compared certain financial information of jbgl to corresponding data and ratios from the following seventeen publicly traded companies that duff amp phelps deemed relevant to its analysis •beazer homes usa inc  •dr horton inc  •hovnanian enterprises inc  •kb home  •lennar corporation  •mdc holdings inc  •meritage homes corporation  •nvr inc  •pultegroup inc  •standard pacific corp  •taylor morrison home corporation  •the ryland group inc  •toll brothers inc  •tri pointe homes inc  •ucp inc  •wci communities inc and  •william lyon homes  although none of these companies is directly comparable to jbgl duff amp phelps selected these companies for its analysis based on their relative similarity to jbgl for purposes of its analysis duff amp phelps used certain publicly available historical financial data and consensus equity analyst estimates for the selected companies this analysis produced valuation multiples of selected financial metrics which duff amp phelps utilized to estimate the equity value of jbgl the tables below summarize certain observed trading multiples and historical and projected financial performance on an aggregate basis of the selected public companies as of june   the estimates for and  in the tables below with respect to the selected public companies were derived based on information for the month periods ending closest to jbgl’s fiscal year ends for which information was available revenue growthreturn on tangible equityeps

homebuilders is around x  so it looks like grbk proforma the deal is trading a little lower than other builders  greenlight loan greenlight loaned grbk  million to complete this deal interest and repayments amounts drawn under the facility will bear interest at  per annum from october   through the first anniversary thereof and  per annum thereafter and the company will have a onetime right to elect to pay up to four consecutive quarters’ interest in kind the facility will have no amortization but is subject to mandatory prepayment with  of the net cash proceeds received from the incurrence of certain debt by the company or the issuance of any equity securities voluntary prepayments of the facility will be permitted at any time all prepayments made prior to october   will be subject to a  prepayment premium so this is another lever to enhance value at grbk  on the conference call brickman said they will do whatever they can to refinance this  low cost land also grbk bought some cheap land during the crisis in    brickman said that they bought a lot of their land a long time ago so they should benefit from that going forward  i have no doubt that is true but i was curious and looked at the land inventory figures on the gbrl balance sheet   here it is again from above their inventory back in  and  was only  million compared to  million as of june   but sure more of current inventory is going to be developed land and homes versus probably a lot of raw land back in   undeveloped land inventory was  million in june    million doesnt sound like all that much even if its raw land at distressed prices  maybe they were really really distressed  also in the cash flow statements from  to  cash used to purchase inventory was  million  million and  million  so thats a lot of inventory building in the past two years even accounting for a large portion of inventory on the balance sheet  check out the cash flow  combined and consolidated statements of cash flowsfor the years ended december    and   cash flows from operating activities       net income adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash used in operating activities       depreciation expense increase decrease in       restricted cash  — accounts receivable   inventory    earnest money deposits  — other assets   increase decrease in       accounts payable accrued expenses customer and builder deposits  net cash used in operating activities    cash flows from investing activities       investment in direct financing leases— — proceeds from sale of direct financing leases— issuance of notes receivable    repayments of notes receivable acquisition of property and equipment    net cash provided by used in investing activities  cash flows from financing activities       borrowings from lines of credit proceeds from notes payable repayments of lines of credit    repayments of notes payable    contributions from controlling interest members contributions from noncontrolling interest members distributions to controlling interest members    distributions to noncontrolling interest members    net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year cash paid for       interest state income taxes so anyway there is probably a lot of low cost inventory on the books but there is also a lot of inventory recently acquired  liquidation value also there is a view that their owned lots are worth a lot more than the balance sheet value  this is probably true particularly for the stuff bought in   etc  but maybe not so much for what was recently acquired  a lot of private equity and others have been running around buying up land since the crisis right  anyway i think the idea is that they have been selling developed lots for lot and they own  plots  that comes to around  million   first of all the problem with this is that the lots sold are developed  land developers buy raw land develop it and then sell it  it does cost money to develop land zoning clearing septicutilities etc here is the breakdown of their inventory as of september    completed home inventory and residential lots held for sale    million   work in process   million   undeveloped land   million  but lets just say the lots are worth  million  add cash as of september  of  million and then deduct  million in total debt and we get around  million  with  million shares outstanding that comes to share  add share in dta and you get share  add share in dta and you get share  the balance sheet is posted above so you can do your own variations of this   this doesnt take into account any tax that may have to be paid on gains in sale of the lots nor does it take into account possible costs to develop the raw inventory   i have my reservations about this sort of valuation because of the potential development costs not included and other assumptions that each plot is worth  but it can be a sanity check   ebitda valuation in the conference call brickman said that they dont want to give guidance but there was guidance with respect to jbgl in the prospectus  in the above table jbgl revenue growth is expected to be  in  already more than  yeartodate through september and  in    ebitda margin is expected to be  in  and  in    these arent official guidance to investors so maybe we shouldnt lean too hard on them  merger proxies often have projections that management uses to evaluate deals etc anyway  revenues were around  million for jbgl in  just adding the home sales and land sales  assuming this grows  for the full year  and then  in  that gets us to revenues of around  million  and put a  ebitda margin on that and we get  expected ebitda of  million with the stock trading at around share  thats a market cap of  million  add  million in total debt and  million in noncontrolling interest less  million in cash we get  million in ev   that values grbk at x evebitda   at x evebitda the stock would be at share this is excluding cash and dta you can do the same sort of exercise using earnings but i thought ebitda would be easier  for earnings you can just add back the losses generated by the old biofuel which should roll off to zero  but with noncontrolling interest taxes and whatnot i figured just looking at the ebitda would be easier you can get to eps using the ebitda above but the trick would be figuring out what the deduction for noncontrolling interest would be it doesnt seem to be a linear relationship conclusion so this is kind of interesting  housing hasnt really recovered as many assumed it would  buying into sectors that have been down and out for a long time are usually a better idea i think than jumping into something when the down cycle may have just begun  for example crude oil is down a lot in the past few months but i dont know if jumping in now would be a great idea  if there is something interesting of course its always a good idea to get in and the lower the price the better  but what i mean is that sometimes the best investments are found not after an immediate crashcollapse but after an extended period of time after the bust  sort of like when loews was buying unwanted rigs  the energy industry was down and out for a long time  i think the rig count has been going down for years at that point when l started scooping up unwanted rigs  the recent rush into energy by private equity funds and others seems to have come after the crash of crude from barrel  and the natural gas investments increased a bunch when gas prices collapsed    some cycles are really long so it may take years for these investments to pan out  in this sense housing is interesting because its been on its back for a few years now  is grbk the right way to play it  im not sure  but what i do think is interesting is that it is sort of an owneroperator situation  greenlight owns  and brickman owns    the  ownership pretty much guarantees that grbk will be run with smart capital allocation or at least an attempt at that  it is a special situation in that it is a reverse merger or backdoor listing not that that works out all the time very often it doesnt  its an opportunity to invest in a private deal that greenlight invested in for a reasonable price   its true that the previous jbgl owners cashed out  million mostly greenlight but greenlight still has more than  million in grbk stock and a  million loan yielding  they paid  million for  million shares in the rights offering last year and accepted  million newly issued shares valued at  million as part of the deal  einhorn called this a winwin deal  but of course it is  its a win for einhorn because he cashed out of jbgl and its a win for einhorn because he found a solution to the biofuel problem and avoided delisting and will be able to realize the dta  current and future investors might win too  they do have two large developments at a higher price point than previous ones that will come online that should fuel growth for a few years i played with some numbers above but i dont know if i got everything right or anything its a messy situation  but thats why its an interesting one right  particularly the evebitda seems quite low but it does assume  sales growth in  which may or may not happen  there is something to be said about the low noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet versus the high amount of income deducted for them this may distort the evebitda too on the other hand the market may just not be discounting a  growth in revenues for  which admittedly may or may not happen all we got from brickman on the conference call is that there are two big new developments that will feed growth for years to come that opens in  stay tuned    posted by kk at  pm email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels einhorn grbk greenlight  comments francisco oliverafebruary   at  pmfor your ev calc i believe you should be subtracting the nol or the dta in that case grbk would appear to have a lower multiple another interesting aspect is that management has received and will received stock based comp at  incentives are aligned to create value management also alluded to using equity to fund growth opportunitiesreplydeletereplieskkfebruary   at  pmgood point i guess the dta is going to be realized with a high probability and its an nol dta so it at least the discounted amount can be subtracted from ev even if its not cash i was curious about funding growth opportunities theyve bought up a ton of inventory recently so hopefully they dont need more massive amounts of capital they have to work through what they already own i suppose equity financing for acquisitions may happen forward deletereplyjayfebruary   at  pmone small note on valuing out the  lots for lot to  million expenses will definitely bring the value down but also time seems unlikely they sell that many lots in a year or two probably not worth it to go through the troubleheadachespreadsheet but best way to really hammer it down is estimate the expenses and rev from lots sold per year then do a dcf on the annual net cf steam over  or  years or whatever reasonable amount of time to sell all those lotsreplydeletereplieskkfebruary   at  pmyes good point i thought of that but the idea was liquidation value so you have to assume that someone can buy it and will have the capacity to develop it immediately or sell off the pieces they cant develop thats the idea of liquidation but yeah in reality thats not going to happen and the value will be some sort of discounted value over time however long it takes to develop and sell the lots deletefrancisco oliverafebruary   at  pmthey actually own  lots and control  based on september financials you can estimate costs pretty easily since they arrive before revenue they are on the balance sheet most of the proceeds will be tax free so the proceeds should mostly turn into cash this will provide the fire power for future opportunities key here is management judging them on current and future deals and capital structure which i believe can be financed with lower cost debt the combination of brickmangl makes this interesting agreed other similar investments might not be worth the timedeletereplyoldfartfebruary   at  ami apologize for the off topic question but how do you save clippings from sec filings i am slowly transitioning to digital note taking and this trick would be

appetizing since ive been looking at it the last couple of years and those dtas will definitely come in handy down the line thanks again replydeletesunnaapril   at  pmthis was hands down one of the best explanations for einhorns get out of jail free card i had stock in both pacific ethanol peix which i was able to sell last year thank the gods for a small profit and biofuel energy corp which has turned into grbk for those shareholders who bothered to open their mail and check the box so thank you i am still holding fast to beacon power the flywheel guys hoping that dog will hunt at least to my break even point replydeletewmmjanuary   at  pmhave you had a chance to revisit this seems interesting and cheep againreplydeleterepliesxfljanuary   at  amwmm i am not sure whats there to revisit its cheap the fundamental story has not changed much except that they raised cash at a very opportune time to pay off expensive debt there is some anxiety over real estate in dallas as a result of energy downturn but that has been the case for some time now the coo was fired for undisclosed reasons but appears that whatever the reasons were they werent material or the company would have had to legally disclose them guidance was lowered but not for reasons that would impair the long term or even midterm value from the co the stock is mostly down due to lack of liquidity and a major pullback in small cap stock i think that sums it up what else do you want to knowdeletereplyanonymousfebruary   at  amhi kk i would like to ask you if you have some current opinion about grbkthanksreplydeletereplieskkfebruary   at  amhi they apparently had some operational issues but my initial thoughts havent changed much of course the world has changed a lot though oil and some of the industrial sector is getting hit hard so i cant imagine it not having an impact in some of their markets but this is more of a timing problem whatever we thought would happen might take more time the big factor is the asset value here and i dont think that changes much other than some near term issues based on the economy etc deleteanonymousfebruary   at  amkk thanks ok sorry if i didn´t understand but when you said that the big factor factor is the asset value that is almost unchanged the asset factor is more of a positive or negative in this casethank you very muchdeletekkfebruary   at  pmthey own a lot of land and thats good usually the market may not like that now if housing slows down and their markets get hit from the oilgas depression but that is not a permanent thing i dont thinkdeleteanonymousfebruary   at  amkk it´s clear now thanks off topic here have you been looking at some new stocks in the downturnthanks againdeletereplyadd commentload more newer post older post
