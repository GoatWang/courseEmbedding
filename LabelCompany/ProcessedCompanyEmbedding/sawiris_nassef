us shale gas and the outlook for egypt  knowledgewharton rows knowledge  wharton search world search finance nassef sawiris on investing in us shale gas and the outlook for egypt apr   africaarabicmiddle east  africanorth america twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote in the heartland of america a contingent of egyptian engineers is working to capitalize on the natural gas opportunity that nassef sawiris says is now possible because of the development of domestic shale gas production egypt’s richest man and his dutchlisted company oci nv have committed  billion in projects in the us including a fertilizer plant in weaver iowa and a new methanol plant in beaumont texas the conglomerate recently listed its integrated ammoniamethanol facility situated in beaumont on the new york stock exchange in addition to numerous construction projects in egypt oci states it is now the largest merchant methanol producer in the us and among the world’s largest nitrogen fertilizer producers     speaking with knowledgewharton ahead of the wharton mena conference on april  which he will attend as a keynote speaker sawiris discussed the opportunities that brought oci to the us and his outlook on the natural gas industry he also discussed egypt and its evolving political situation though he predicts the country’s turbulence will continue until the summer there are sectors right now that are still attracting investors he said an edited transcript of the conversation follows knowledgewharton for oci what was the value and opportunity in establishing us operations nassef sawiris as a company we have a track record in gas monetization projects and it became pretty obvious to us that the shale gas revolution in the us is not for one season but is a phenomenon that is here to stay for an extended period of time this natural gas advantage is a good opportunity for us to do what we have done previously in other markets such as holland which has entered into industries that require natural gas so the first attraction was that transformation of the us from an energydeficient market at least in natural gas to abundance then we looked at the products that the us is deficit in and is currently a large importer we said that’s an easy take to be in the import substitution business because then you know exactly the demand that exists to date and you’re immediately replacing an import shipment from china or saudi arabia by producing it domestically — in this case in iowa in the heart of the cornbelt knowledgewharton what can your firm contribute to american knowhow as it develops its shale gas industry sawiris we have built five similar plants in the last  years so we have inhouse capabilities that give us an edge as a builder of these facilities we’re not just an investor our engineering and construction groups are playing a vital role in the execution of these projects knowledgewharton as the us domestic energy market develops what must it do to avoid some of the pitfalls that you see in traditional markets “it became pretty obvious to us that the shale gas revolution in the us is not for one season but is a phenomenon that is here to stay for an extended period of time” sawiris the us has two issues the approval process particularly with the epa environmental protection agency is a significant barrier for entry it takes about two years to complete the entire approval process including some preliminary engineering work the second thing is that the labor cost in building a facility like that in the us is in the permanhour range with costs included in the mechanical construction industry those costs in the middle east are a dollar per hour on the plus side you have better rule of law less risk and less currency risk a dollar is a hundred cents in the next hundred years so when you are thinking of dollar denominations as a commodity you are spending in dollars and you are paying wages in dollars it makes things a lot simpler knowledgewharton what are your predictions for the natural gas market and the knockon effect that the us shale gas industry will have on it sawiris what we monitor are the year forward contracts of natural gas and what they seem to indicate is that gas prices are not going to deviate significantly from where they are now as for the us it’s a great market we didn’t do just one investment we are embarking on our third investment with the new plant in texas knowledgewharton do you have an opinion on the liberalization of us liquefied natural gas lng exports and the debate about how this will affect global prices what is your opinion about the current market and its direction knowledgewharton high school sawiris i hope the government views this with some prudence a lot of countries like egypt and indonesia have big lng facilities and just  years later they’ve become net gas importers so i truly hope the analysis on when to stop those exports takes place i can’t jump to any conclusions but one of the interesting things about shale gas unlike a single megafield is that there are not any accurate numbers on what are the us gas reserves so if you don’t know you cannot draw a conclusion on what is a prudent size of export israel for example has one big field that they can get comfort through geological assessment on what the reserves of that field are then they can say we’re happy to export  the situation is much more complex here because you’re extracting gas acre by acre knowledgewharton there are complexities in the political realm here as well in the methanol market there have been efforts in congress to legislate the open fuel standard act in what direction is the use of methanol in gasoline headed sawiris this is a matter of time the technology is right politicians can only delay the inevitable for a limited amount of time what’s happening now is that it’s not just china using methanol in gasoline but israel and australia are also about to launch their own legislation this year authorizing the use of methanol in the gasoline stream europe is using about  already so i think it is inevitable it’s a cleaner fuel it’s ussourced and it will improve the octane for the cars hence making the efficiencies required by the new laws in the us easier to achieve for the automotive manufacturers knowledgewharton there is still resistance in the us market to adopting alternative fuels what’s the message that you feel needs to get out there sawiris let’s be clear — nobody is advocating the elimination of gasoline and shifting to methanol we’re advocating that methanol be added into the fuel mix alongside ethanol and gasoline that’s a much easier proposition adding a second product into the gasoline stream the marketplace will determine — they will only do it if it is efficient and it results in price savings from an environmental issue it is superior so you are getting to a situation where you could have price advantages and environmental advantages and you’re not going to change your car you’re not going to cng you’re not changing your engine it’s just allowing for gas stations to use that blend knowledgewharton if we could talk about the ammonia market — ammonia prices in april are expected to rise  due to the crisis in ukraine is it a temporary blip or a sign of things to come sawiris i don’t see it as a temporary blip there are two possible outcomes i see from my limited analytical experience one outcome is that ukraine is going to be paying higher gas prices the other outcome is there will be production disruptions a third outcome which i think has zero chance of materializing is that russia will continue to sell cheap gas to the hostile government in the ukraine i can’t highlight which of the first two outcomes will materialize but both of them result in higher ammonia prices it doesn’t affect the prices of ammonia as a global commodity only the us uses ammonia in direct farm applications most of the other uses of ammonia worldwide are industrial “there are sectors of the egyptian economy that have been on fire in the last one or two years despite all the political turmoil” knowledgewharton let’s turn to egypt what is your outlook on the country and what does it mean for foreign direct investment sawiris i’m quite positive on egypt i think we’re going to have a few more months of turbulence until there is an election and we have a new president and a new parliament but a timeline has been set for three to four months i expect that by july all this will be accomplished and then people will have an address to talk to and all that so in the short term these are the next milestones for egypt in general i think the political situation will converge obviously there will be some negative implications for some of the court rulings that made the news what people don’t understand is that regrettably the first round of court rulings in egypt is almost immaterial it’s such a junior court it’s almost like a traffic court knowledgewharton what are you telling investors then who don’t possess such knowledge of the internal workings of egypt such headlines for instance are also keeping tourists away sawiris there are sectors of the egyptian economy that have been on fire in the last one or two years despite all the political turmoil consumer goods are doing amazingly well building materials businesses are now getting attention the government is doing a lot of infrastructure projects so infrastructure will be an opportunity there is energy legislation — including price reform — that has to be passed to make that sector attractive and then the last important sector after the stabilization of the security situation the return of tourism and usually once security stabilizes the tourists will return there will be pentup demand because everybody wants to come to egypt you’ll move to  to  occupancy from  to  occupancy knowledgewharton can you talk about the inflows of investment into egypt from the gulf now that it has shifted from qatar to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates  sawiris i don’t think egypt would be in the position it is today without the  billion of infusions that happened to support the ouster of the muslim brotherhood it had to come it came at the right time and it created strong support for the egyptian economy you saw the reaction on the stock market the stabilization on a lot of inflationary issues it’s not like the normal  billion or  billion investments and loans that we used to get in the past this is what you call putting in a floor to any possible decline of the egyptian economy knowledgewharton during the arab spring there was a split in investor mentality toward the mena region that looked at arab gulf economies as stable versus egypt or libya is it time for investors to look at the region as a whole again sawiris it depends on the sector if you’re in the consumer goods business — if you’re procter  gamble if you’re unilever — there is opportunity in the midst of all this we’re building a plant for mars in egypt and we just finished an expansion for procter  gamble so you have to be selective about the sector obviously it’s a huge market with great opportunities health care is one real estate is another building materials is huge “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger we’ve been having crises for the past  years… i would say that it’s a good training ground” in the mena region there are economies that rely  on a single product look at saudi abu dhabi kuwait and qatar if oil prices tank to  it might be very negative for those economies but it might be great for egypt so the importance of this onetrick pony economy is huge iraq moved from averaging two million barrels a day last year to exporting  million barrels per day in february that’s  growth in oil exports from iraq so you have to continue to segregate the economies what’s good for egypt and morocco may not necessarily be good for saudi arabia and kuwait knowledgewharton in that evolving situation where will oci position itself in egypt and in the larger region as a whole sawiris to be honest i have to be politically correct here in the last three years we have made our numberone focus to be an active player in gas monetization in the us a company with limited resources has to focus on what its targets are so a lot of our capex budgets went to our project in beaumont our developments in iowa and our third project in beaumont which is over a billion dollars this is fine we think the opportunities in egypt in our sector will probably materialize more in  than  so after the elections a few months of a stable government discussions to bring back the international monetary fund — which i think is the second half of the  agenda — and political reconciliation and we will be in investigative mode by  we could be really in a big investment model  we’re really focused right now there will be a window for who builds what plants in the us first and i think that the labor market from  is going to be on fire the us housing market will see a million housing starts by march next year so sometime next year it’s going to be tough to find a contractor to build your facility we’re racing against time in the next  months these commitments in addition to beaumont are  billion of additional construction expenditures that we’re putting in the us that’s a sizeable commitment are we looking out there at more opportunities yes absolutely and we could certainly be adding some more capacities in certain products knowledgewharton oci delisted from egypt and moved to the netherlands can you talk about that experience sawiris i think you have to look at the decision in the context of the time this was done in the context of a government that was extremely hostile to women minorities christians and a lot of businessmen so i would say that if we hadn’t moved to holland we would have moved to siberia or alaska under the muslim brotherhood it wasn’t a matter of choice to move the company headquarters when we were being harassed on a daily basis but it didn’t change any of our dynamics we didn’t move any of our plants from egypt we’re actually hiring more in egypt delisting didn’t dramatically change our shareholders historically outside the family we had a big following in london the bulk of shareholders moved from london to holland rather than from egypt to holland knowledgewharton the storyline during the arab spring was that the gulf economies were stable and received a number of egyptians libyans and syrians escaping the troubles and bringing their money do you see a reversal of that trend sawiris in the middle east you never know what place is safe it’s the place of the week knowledgewharton in egypt your company has dealt with some inhospitable conditions in the past couple of years how did you keep your employees focused  sawiris as the saying goes what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger we’ve been having crises for the past  years so we laugh when we see some problems that we face in iowa or texas compared to that sort of environment i would say that it’s a good training ground citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to
