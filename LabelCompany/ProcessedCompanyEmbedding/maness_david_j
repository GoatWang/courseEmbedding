proper framing of evolutionary hypotheses regarding adaptive parental sex allocation competition for mates evolution of mating systems and endangered species management we traced the development of a malebiased adult sex ratio in nazca boobies sula granti by determination of the sex ratio at hatching fledging and at returning to join the adult population the sex ratio at hatching and fledging did not differ from unity while the return sex ratio was significantly malebiased therefore the observed adult sex ratio bias arises after the period of parental care ends during the subadultjuvenile

volume by terri j manessauthor david j andersonauthor pages illustrationsamerican ornithologists union paperback  oct     isbn  out of print details about this book language english with bilingual summary in english and spanishthe survival probability of birds during the juvenile period between the end of parental care and adulthood is highly variable and has a major effect on population dynamics and parental fitness as such a large number of studies have attempted to evaluate potential predictors of juvenile survival in birds especially predictors related to parental care lacks hypothesis linking body reserves accumulated from parental care to the survival of naive juveniles has organized much of this research but various other predictors have also been investigated and received some supportwe reviewed the literature in this area and identified a variety of methodological problems that obscure interpretation of the body of results most studies adopted statistical techniques that missed the opportunities to  evaluate the relative importance of several predictors  control the confounding effect of correlation among predictor variables and  exploit the information content of collinearity by evaluating indirect via correlation as well as direct effects of potential predictors on juvenile survival ultimately we concluded that too few reliable studies exist to allow robust evaluations of any hypothesis regarding juvenile survival in birdswe used path analysis to test potential predictors of juvenile survival of  offspring from seven annual cohorts of a seabird the nazca booby sula granti fledging age was the most important predictor of juvenile survival fastgrowing offspring survived best when all other variables were held constant offspring sex was the next most important predictor with juvenile males the smaller sex surviving better than females hatching day an index of body weight and wing length also showed important predictive ability but cohort size culmen length and an index of clutch size and hatching success did not nestling growth was compromised under poor rearing conditions overall weight fell the number of days needed to reach fledging status increased and the growth of some structures but not others was reduced these effects were more pronounced in females and the higher juvenile mortality of females accounts for most of the male bias in the adult sex ratio and its attendant mate rotation mating system in this population most previous studies did not evaluate sex as a potential predictor of juvenile survival had we omitted sex from our models we would have made two erroneous conclusions that weight did not influence juvenile survival and that small structural size enhanced it write a
