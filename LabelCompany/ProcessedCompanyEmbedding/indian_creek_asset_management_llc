holder of kearny financial asks board to consider strategic alternatives dec    et from indian creek investors lp aventura fla dec   prnewswire  indian creek investors lp a private investment fund and the largest independent shareholder of kearny financial corp nasdaq krny the holding company for kearny federal savings bank based in fairfield nj sent a letter to kearnys board of directors encouraging the board to consider strategic alternatives to remaining an independent partiallyconverted thrift gary siegler the manager of indian creek investors wrote in the letter to the board of directors while we applaud the companys recently announced share repurchase program and ceo craig montanaros efforts to transform the company we believe that shareholders interests are best served at this time through a strategic transaction citing the recent acquisition of another new jersey based thrift roma bancorp mr siegler continued as was the case with roma we believe kearnys shares offer tremendous upside potential in a strategic transaction a copy of the full letter is included below   december     attn board of directors kearny financial corp  passaic avenue fairfield nj    ladies and gentlemen indian creek investors a private investment fund based in aventura fl is the beneficial owner of over  shares of kearny financial corp kearny or the company  based on information available on bloomberg we believe indian creek is currently the largest independent holder of kearny financial shares holding approximately  of the companys outstanding common stock that is held by persons other than the companys parent mutual holding company kearny mhc  while we applaud the companys recently announced share repurchase program and ceo craig montanaros efforts to transform the company we believe that shareholders interests are best served at this time through a strategic transaction  this view is reinforced by the recently approved purchase of roma financial corp of which indian creek was also a significant holder by investors bancorp like kearny roma is a partiallyconverted new jersey based thrift  prior to the announcement last december that roma would be sold for stock to investors bancorp roma shares traded at approximately  per share at this same time kearny shares traded at approximately  per share today roma shares have risen approximately  to over  per share in anticipation of the mergers imminent closing kearnys shares meanwhile remain under  per share as was the case with roma we believe kearnys shares offer tremendous upside potential in a strategic transaction given what we perceive to be the extraordinary gap between kearnys current trading value and its value in a strategic combination we respectfully ask the board to formally consider strategic alternatives to remaining an independent partiallyconverted thrift  we are available to discuss our views with you in further detail at your convenience  we look forward to speaking with you very truly yours   s gary siegler managingmember of ic holdings llc as managing member of indian creek asset management llc as general partnerof indian creek investors lp     contact sabrina
