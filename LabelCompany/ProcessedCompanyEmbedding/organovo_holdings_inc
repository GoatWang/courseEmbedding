speights tmffishbiz dec   at am this turned out to be great year for organovo holdings nasdaqonvo shares of the dbioprinting company climbed over  during  organovo had several important developments during the year but what was the companys biggest win image source getty images launch of second commercial product in september organovo announced the launch of its second commercial product exvive human kidney tissue this kidney tissue enables customers to study the effects of drug exposure in the human kidney as part of their drug discovery and development processes the companys first product exvive human liver tissue hit the market in  organovo was receiving orders for its new dbioprinted kidney tissue even before the launch was announced the company said that multiple contracts had been signed including with two of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world the primary benefit to customers for using the dbioprinted kidney tissue is that it can allow drugmakers to detect toxicity earlier than conventional approaches such as animal testing this early detection can potentially save pharmaceutical companies a lot of money why was this the biggest win of the year for organovo the addition of a second product immediately added to the companys revenue growth it also opened up a new market that is a natural extension to organovos liver tissue business organovos executives think that the kidney tissue business could eventually generate annual revenue of  million or more honorable mentions while the launch of the exvive human kidney tissue was arguably organovos biggest win in  the company did have several other successes honorable mentions go to more than tripling revenue from the prior year and to a couple of important scientific publications and presentations in march bristolmyers squibb nysebmy and organovo scientists presented data at the society of toxicologys annual meeting these presentations focused on the benefits and potential of using d human liver tissues to detect druginduced liver toxicity in july researchers from roche nasdaqothrhhby and organovo published data in the scientific journal plos one this publication discussed the effectiveness of organovos human liver tissue in detecting toxicity in particular the data compared the dbioprinted liver tissue to traditional preclinical testing methods including animal models  although the collaborations with bristolmyers squibb and roche werent quite as critical as the kidney tissue launch they were nonetheless important to organovos future the biggest hurdle to the companys success is resistance to adopting the new d tissues having major customers publicly endorse use of these tissues and citing data to back up why theyre going do is huge looking ahead to  i expect organovo to sustain its momentum in the new year the company thinks that it will continue to grow revenue by tripledigit percentages well into the future my hunch is that outlook will be true for  at least look for more presentations and publications in the new year like the ones with bristol and roche in  the more organovo gets the word out with solid data backing up its claims the more traction it will get organovo plans to expand its offerings to include metabolism studies thats a smart strategy that fits well with what the company is already doing organovo hasnt announced a timeline for its metabolism program efforts my prediction though is that its biggest win in  will be the launch of this new service   keith speights has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley

keith speights tmffishbiz sep   at pm image source getty images what a difference a year makes in  organovo holdings nasdaqonvo lost nearly twothirds of its market cap this year though the d bioprinting leaders stock is up over  so far organovo just launched its second product exvive human kidney tissue shareholders are probably feeling more confident than they have in quite a while but just how risky is organovo right now dilution when the cash begins to run out for a company that has yet to reach profitability the primary options available are to either borrow or raise money through a secondary stock offering if the company takes the latter route existing shares are diluted in value and the stock price typically takes a beating organovo reported  million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as of june  the company also posted a loss of just under  million in its last quarter simple math shows that organovo cant keep on losing that amount of money for too long before more cash will be needed i expect organovos bottom line will improve however especially with its kidney tissue now on the market that should allow the company to stretch out its cash i dont think theres an immediate dilution risk for organovo but i wouldnt be surprised if the company issued more shares within the next year or so  inertia if you asked organovo ceo keith murphy what his companys biggest challenges are its quite likely that hed include winning over customers who remain skeptical about d bioprinted tissues organovo faces something akin to the physics law of inertia it can be difficult to get a customer to move to something new the risk for organovo is that this customer inertia could potentially result in a much longer time frame required for the company to reach profitability it could also prevent the company from achieving its longrange vision of making  million and more in annual revenue how significant is this inertia risk i wouldnt underestimate the challenges that organovo faces the companys exvived human liver tissue has been commercially available since november  and will probably generate less than  million in the companys current fiscal year on the other hand organovo is making headway merck nysemrk became one of the first major drugmakers to join forces with organovo the two companies entered into a multiyear research collaboration in april  to develop custom tissue models using organovos bioprinting platform merck also gained access to exvived human liver tissue for use in its drug development efforts organovo is also trying to influence perception of d tissues through scientific publications in july researchers from organovo and roche nasdaqothrhhby published an article in plos one that described advantages for using organovos d bioprinted human liver tissue in drug development   competition keith murphy has downplayed the threat from competition in the past when asked about other d bioprinting companies murphy replied that organovos rivals only had small percentages of market share and were not a major driver in terms of competition my impression is that organovo is doing a better job of marketing itself than others  for now at least collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies give credibility that smaller rivals wont have  i wouldnt be too dismissive of competitive risks however in some ways organovos success in winning customers like merck and roche could help pave the way for those same companies to entertain d bioprinted products from other suppliers privately held nd biosciences is one smaller rival that is talking to some of the same prospects that organovo is going after how risky organovos stock is without question risky but so is every stock the question investors must ask themselves is whether the level of risk is acceptable for the potential rewards owning the stock could bring the answer to this question will vary by investor  while i suspect dilution will happen at some point thats just a temporary negative for investors its still early in the game for d human tissues i think recognition of the advantages in detecting drug toxicity will increase dramatically over the next two to three years resulting in a decrease in the inertia risk if im right organovo should reap the rewards its rivals could also benefit but i think organovo will be the biggest winner my take is that organovos stock isnt too risky considering the possibilities for its technology keith speights has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of
