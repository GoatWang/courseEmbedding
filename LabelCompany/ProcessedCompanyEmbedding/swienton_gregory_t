held until becoming president and ceo in november  a member of ryders board of directors since june  mr swienton was named its chairman in may  before joining ryder he was senior vice presidentgrowth initiatives at burlington northern santa fe corporation and also had served as the companys senior vice president of the coal and agricultural commodities business unit he earned his mba with an emphasis in finance from the university of chicago and a bba degree in marketing from loyola university chicagotwst would you start with a history and overview of ryder system incmr swienton jim ryder founded the company in  so next year well be celebrating  years in business but even though weve been around a while we still make basically the same promise to our customers  that they can rely on us to handle their transportation and logistics functions more efficiently more cost effectively and more consistently than what they could achieve by doing it themselves so outsourcing to us allows our customers to focus on improving and growing their core business we have some of the very same offerings that weve had since jim ryder created them like the concept of a fullservice lease but over time weve also infused our services with quality processes innovations and quite a bit of technology and we have many newer services for customers that of course are relevant in todays global sourcing and production environmentwe report externally in two segments fleet management solutions is the largest and the oldest business segment and it includes commercial truck rental leasing maintenance and some other auxiliary services as well as all of our usedvehicle sales were one of the largest usedvehicle retail providers in the country we do that through more than  used truck sale centers in north america the other segment is supply chain solutions which includes dedicated contract carriage as one of its largest service offerings weve previously reported dedicated contract carriage separately but from a practical standpoint this offering has been managed as a fully integrated component of our supply chain solutions for a number of years now its a turnkey solution that includes not just the equipment but also the drivers and the routing and the scheduling and its connected to fully engineered supply chain solutions such as planning and execution and justintime deliveries of components into largescale assembly plants in industries such as hightech automotive and otherstwst art garcia ryders cfo recently told cfo magazine in a recessionary environment were a cash flow story and in a growth environment we become an earnings story what impact has the recent economic downturn had on ryder as you look at the various industries and sectors the company deals with did it call for you to change the companys strategies or goals over the past  to  monthsmr swienton this is a good point and i think its important to investors in fact the quote he used wasnt created by him or by us thats actually a reflection of what some analysts have written about us we thought that captured very well exactly the kind of investment we are i think what weve tried to do over time is improve our business model in fact it is somewhat countercyclical so that it does increase cash flow during downturns and it provides us the option to make a lot of progress when businesses are uncertain about making longterm commitments for our contractual product linestwst in the s ryder sold its consumer rental division that was well known how big is your fleet today and whats the makeup of the product linesmr swienton its about  commercial rental vehicles today thats trucks tractors and trailers and those are the ones you see on the street that are white with the redandblack logo theyre distinguished from the leased vehicles which have our customers logos on them by far the largest part of our fleet is the fullservice lease offering and that has probably now over  units but those are not as easy to spot as a ryder unit because they have our customers logos painted on the side of the trucks or trailers and the only way youll recognize its a ryderleased maintained product is through a little sticker on the cab door or the driver door that will have a ryder logo and a registration numberthe wall street transcript is a unique service for investors and industry researchers

grandfather came to america from poland and could not read or write until the day he died his father was a union worker in chicago and today gregory t  swienton leads a fortune  company ryder system inc with revenues topping  billion a year and  employees worldwideryder ceo greg swienton the first in his family to attend college oversees a company with  employees swienton – the first person in his family to attend college — shared both personal and professional details  on nov  at worldcity’s  annual global connections distinguished speaker programthe chicagoborn executive heads up an awardwinning transport and logistics company founded in miami beach in  and still based in south florida it focuses mainly on managing vehicle fleets warehouses and distribution for large companies mainly in north america europe and asiaryder is known for its technology even earning its firstever patent recently for software  for solid employee relations often appearing in lists of best places to work for women and hispanics and for environmental efforts recently becoming the first transport company to win a top “green” awardswienton spent more than two years in a seminary during college and emphasizes values of community service character and “getting things done the right way” for all employees those ethical values nurtured longterm “give continued performance and credibility in the organization” he saidthe distinguished speaker program is a departure from the normal panel discussion held during the nine other events at global connections each year the distinguished speaker program was initiated in  with citrix ceo mark templetonhere are some of swienton’s answers to participant questionson the future of the us economy  ryder’s chief executive and chairman sees slow multiyear growth ahead the big constraint uncertainty “until you have certainty on tax and regulation policy you will not have large companies creating jobs” he saidon tips for being a ceo build a strong staff that means looking for and cultivating people who are honest with high integrity speak openly and who put politics aside he referenced the book “speed of trust” by stephen covey as helpful to build a strong teamswienton sees no clear path to becoming a ceo but generally advises  “do the very best in the job you’re in and your career will take care of itself”on free trade and the nafta trucking dispute “there’s nothing better than trade and free trade” swienton said yet achieving it often means careful negotiationfor example the north american free trade agreement called for mexican trucks to cross freely into the united states but us groups have resisted “i think driven by the teamsters and their argument is safety” swienton saidthe solution   involve the teamsters and negotiate an accord that all “trucks have the same standards” to operate in the united states he responded to fedex’s don johnsonon factories moving nearshore  as fuel costs rise swienton sees more factories moving back from asia to mexico to supply products for the us market that’s welcome news for ryder because “one of the jewels of our operation is mexico and crossborder” businesson labor unions “if you have managementemployee relations that are truly bad that’s when you tend to have unions… i think they are a bit of an anachronism” swienton responded to hogan group’s steve smithryder has unions mainly in cities with long histories of unions including new york boston chicago and los angeles he sees unions as often politicized “the fact that you have unions for government jobs is a way to take a lot of dues and use them for political purposes and i find that inappropriate” on trends in logistics look for miniaturization of goodsfor example newspapers used to be a key customer for transport companies but newspapers are getting smaller or moving to the internet books too are moving to ereaders over time that means fewer trucks and cargohauling equipment needed he responded to lancargo’s matias lagoson attracting more corporate headquarters to south florida a south florida headquarters helps in creating a “betterthanaverage” board of directors because many senior executives or retired ones have homes in the area swienton said  wall street also gives “disproportionate attention” to south florida companies because analysts and like to visit the sunny area during cold new york winters he saidbut luring top managers to live in south florida presents a key challenge  education for their children schools lag other areas and executives invariably ask if they will have to send their kids to private school “that’s one of the biggest deals” he responded to luis casas of florida international university’s school of business administrationon appearing on the tv show undercover boss swienton said he’s been approached to do the show but figures it would not work well with him he’s very visible in the company speaking and answering questions on live web casts sending out cds for truckers to listen to while driving and visiting offices“one of my objectives is not to be unknown and also to be approachable” swienton responded to medtronic’s cristina palacios “i would need a very serious disguise”global connections is one of six event series organized by worldcity to bring together executives of multinational companies to discuss international business
