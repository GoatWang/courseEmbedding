also  references  external links related termsedit investment differs from arbitrage in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk an investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested whereas in saving such as in a bank deposit the risk of loss in nominal value is normally remote note that if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holders home currency then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavorably so that the value in the account holders home currency of the savings account decreases speculation involves a level of risk which is greater than most investors would generally consider justified by the expected return an alternative characterization of speculation is its shortterm opportunistic nature famous investorsedit investors famous for their success include warren buffett in march  forbes magazine warren buffett ranked number  in their forbes  list buffett has advised in numerous articles and interviews that a good investment strategy is long term and choosing the right assets to invest in requires due diligence edward o thorp was a highly successful hedge fund manager in the s and s who spoke of a similar approach the investment principles of both of these investors have points in common with the kelly criterion for money management numerous interactive calculators which use the kelly criterion can be found online intermediaries and collective investmentsedit investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions these intermediaries include pension funds banks and insurance companies they may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts unit trusts sicavs etc to make large scale investments each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased subject to charges levied by the intermediary which may be large and varied approaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include dollar cost averaging and market timing historyedit the code of hammurabi around  bc provided a legal framework for investment establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard to pledged land punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving injury or death in the early s purchasers of stocks bonds and other securities were described in media academia and commerce as speculators by the s the term investment had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time since the last half of the th century the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures value investmentedit main article value investing a value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued and sells overvalued ones to identify undervalued securities a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security value investors employ accounting ratios such as earnings per share and sales growth to identify securities trading at prices below their worth warren buffett and benjamin graham are notable examples of value investors graham and dodds seminal work security analysis was written in the wake of the wall street crash of   the price to earnings ratio pe or earnings multiple is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio with a function of dividing the share price of stock by its earnings per share this will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings this ratio is an important aspect due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies a stock with a lower pe ratio will cost less per share than one with a higher pe taking into account the same level of financial performance therefore it essentially means a low pe is the preferred option an instance in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance is when companies in different industries are compared an example although it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a pe in the low teens in the case of hitech stock a pe in the s range is not unusual when making comparisons the pe ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation for investors paying for each dollar of a companys earnings the pe ratio is a significant indicator but the pricetobook ratio pb is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets in the process of the pb ratio the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets any intangibles such as goodwill are not taken into account it is a crucial factor of the pricetobook ratio due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation of intangibles accordingly the pb could be considered a comparatively conservative metric free cash flow and capital structureedit free cash flow measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors after allowing for reinvestment in working capital and capital expenditure high and rising free cash flow therefore tend to make a company more attractive to investors the debttoequity ratio is an indicator of capital structure a high proportion of debt reflected in a high debttoequity ratio tends to make a companys earnings free cash flow and ultimately the returns to its investors more risky or volatile investors compare a companys debttoequity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry and examine trends in debttoequity ratios and free cash flow ebitdaedit a popular valuation metric is earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda with application for example to valuing unlisted companies and mergers and acquisitions for an attractive investment for example a company competing in a high growth industry an investor might expect a significant acquisition premium above book value or current market value which values the company at several times the most recent ebitda a private equity fund for example may buy a target company for a multiple of its historical or forecasted ebitda perhaps as much as  or  times in certain cases an ebitda may be sacrificed by a company in order for the pursuance of future growth a strategy frequently used by corporate giants such as amazon google and microsoft among others this is a business decision that can impact negatively on buyout offers founded on ebitda and can be the cause of many negotiations failing it may be recognized as a valuation breach with many investors maintaining that sellers are too demanding while buyers are

deposit the risk of loss in nominal value is normally remote note that if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holders home currency then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavorably so that the value in the account holders home currency of the savings account decreases speculation involves a level of risk which is greater than most investors would generally consider justified by the expected return an alternative characterization of speculation is its shortterm opportunistic nature famous investorsedit investors famous for their

principles of both of these investors have points in common with the kelly criterion for money management numerous interactive calculators which use the kelly criterion can be found online intermediaries and collective investmentsedit investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions these intermediaries include pension funds banks and insurance companies they may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts unit trusts sicavs etc to make large scale investments each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased subject to charges levied by the intermediary which may be large and varied approaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include dollar cost averaging and market timing historyedit the code of hammurabi around  bc provided a legal framework for investment establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard to pledged land punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving injury or death in the early s purchasers of stocks bonds and other securities were described in media academia and commerce as speculators by the s the term investment had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time since the last half of the th century the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures value investmentedit main article value investing a value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued and sells overvalued ones to identify undervalued securities a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security value investors employ accounting ratios such as earnings per share and sales growth to identify securities trading at prices below their worth warren buffett and benjamin graham are notable examples of value investors graham and dodds seminal work security analysis was written in the wake of the wall street crash of   the price to earnings ratio pe or earnings multiple is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio with a function of dividing the share price of stock by its earnings per share this will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings this ratio is an important aspect due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies a stock with a lower pe ratio will cost less per share than one with a higher pe taking into account the same level of financial performance therefore it essentially means a low pe is the preferred option an instance in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance is when companies in different industries are compared an example although it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a pe in the low teens in the case of hitech stock a pe in the s range is not unusual when making comparisons the pe ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation for investors paying for each dollar of a companys earnings the pe ratio is a significant indicator but the pricetobook ratio pb is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets in the process of the pb ratio the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets any intangibles such as goodwill are not taken into account it is a crucial factor of the pricetobook ratio due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation of intangibles accordingly the pb could be considered a comparatively conservative metric free cash flow and capital structureedit free cash flow measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors after allowing for reinvestment in working capital and capital expenditure high and rising free cash flow therefore tend to make a company more attractive to investors the debttoequity ratio is an indicator of capital structure a high proportion of debt reflected in a high debttoequity ratio tends to make a companys earnings free cash flow and ultimately the returns to its investors more risky or volatile investors compare a companys debttoequity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry and examine trends in debttoequity ratios and free cash flow ebitdaedit a popular valuation metric is earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda with application for example to valuing unlisted companies and mergers and acquisitions for an attractive investment for example a company competing in a high growth industry an investor might expect a significant acquisition premium above book value or current market value which values the company at several times the most recent ebitda a private equity fund for example may buy a target company for a multiple of its historical or forecasted ebitda perhaps as much as  or  times in certain cases an ebitda may be sacrificed by a company in order for the pursuance of future growth a strategy frequently used by corporate giants such as amazon google and microsoft among others this is a business decision that can impact negatively on buyout offers founded on ebitda and can be the cause of many negotiations failing it may be recognized as a valuation breach with many investors maintaining that sellers are too demanding while buyers are regarded as failing to realize the longterm potential of expenditure

spending and the islm modelnext tutorialarticles on the keynesian perspectivevideo transcriptin our planned expenditure model weve been assuming that planned investment is fixed and what i want to do in this video is think about how real interest rates drive planned investment think about the function  investment as a function of real interest rates planned investment as a function of real interest rates and when im talking about real interest rates im really just talking about nominal interest rates factoring out or discounting whats going on with inflation and theres other videos where we go into more depth on that another way to think about that is if there were no inflation real and nominal interest rates would be the same thing and i want to tackle it with a very tangible example so lets say in this upcoming year there is a bunch of potential planned projects so lets call this projects so these are really potential investments so you have projects and then you have some level of expected return so each of the people who are thinking about these projects they all have their spreadsheets out and have taken in risk and probabilites and all of the rest and theyve come up with their expected return numbers and lets say project a has an expected return of  b  c  ill do a couple more d  e is  and then lets say f is  and lets say initially in one state of affairs interest rates are relatively high so lets say r is equal to  interest rates so if we have  real interest rates and these are the real expected returns which of these projects will actually be invested in which ones will people actually do well if someone has the cash they say i could either lend my money out for  or i could do this project a and get  so if they have the cash they would definitely do this and if they dont have the cash they could say well i could borrow money for  and i can invest it at  ill make money off of that so project a  project a will definitely be done now what about project b well project b if the person actually has the cash on hand to do project b they say well i could do project b and get an  real return or i could lend that money out and get a  real return so actually i would not do project b and obviously i would not do anything that has an even lower real return and if i could potentially do project b but i had to borrow the money well if i had to borrow the money at  real interest and im only getting  on it thats a moneylosing proposition so i wouldnt do b and i definitely wouldnt do all of these things that get a lower return so when i have high interest rates over here the only thing i would is project a project a so now lets think about what would happen if interest rates went down if real interest rates went down so lets say real interest rates well call that r go down to  well once again project a youre definitely going to do if you have the money on hand you get  doing project a you definitely dont want to lend it out at  if you dont have the money on hand you can borrow at  and invest at  and so by the same logic people would do project b you could borrow at  and make  or if you have the money you get  versus  on your money so you definitely do this you do all of these you would even do project e if you have the money you would rather put that money and get  than lend it out and only get  so youll even do project e if you need to borrow it it still makes sense borrow money at  invest it at  and youre making some real return the only one you would not do is project f right over here because here you arent actually covering your cost of borrowing if you had to borrow at  and invest at  doesnt make sense if you have the money you would rather lend your money out at  than do project f so youre definitely not going to do project f in this scenario and you obviously do it in neither scenario so right over here youd do all of the above so you would do a b c d all of the above except for f a b c d and e so lets just think about the rough level of investment if we were to plot on this axis right over here if we were to plot the investment as a function of real interest rates and over here we actually have our indepedent variable  real interest rate at a high real interest we had a low level of investment we only did project a so thats right over there that is a only so this is when we were at r and when we lowered interest rates to r we had a much higher level of investment we did all of these projects right over here so you had a much higher level of investment so this is a b c d and e and so you see that you have an inverse relationship the lower the real interest rate the more investment is going to go on the higher the interest rate the less investment that goes on and you can debate whether its a curve or a line but for sake of simplicity well assume that it looks something like this ill draw a dotted line its easier for me to do that it might look something like that and now we can use this insight to start thinking about how a change in real interest rate might shift our planned expenditures on our keynesian cross and from that we can start to think about the is curve the famous is curve from the islm modelconnecting the keynesian cross to the is curveup nextconnecting the keynesian cross to the is curve investment vs consumption  video  khan academy if youre

classroomfacebooktwitteremailinvestment and consumptionrisk and reward introductionhuman capitalreturn on capitalinvestment vs consumption investment vs consumption wealth destruction wealth destruction backofenvelope office space conundrumvideo transcriptlets continue with this example and i welcome you to throw examples my way and we can think about whether something is consumption or investment and my argument in general is that investment is something good for society its good for you it is capital right or money thats being put to work to create more wealth or more capital or more good for society while consumption is capital that is essentially being burned in some way usually for some type of social status or ego gratification well lets think about that what about a going out once a month lets say a vacation this is an interesting case a simple vacation with family maybe its a family reunion depending on your family it might be simple or it might be relaxing it might not but lets assume this is a relaxing vacation youre going camping or youre going to yosemite or something its a very peaceful tranquil thing to do so your original gut reaction would be well if we take a vacation me and my family were going to take time off were not going to work my kids arent going to be in school so you might say oh well thats consumption because were going to spend money lets say the vacation cost  right were spending  on this vacation so that might be an investment or that might be consumption so at first you might say thats consumption youre not going to be working once you go on that vacation theres nothing left over but there could be a counter argument here there could be an argument that by taking this simple vacation with the family it recenters you it bonds with your family it makes you a happier human being and it makes you more likely to be able to contribute to society once you get back home and if you didnt take this vacation you would eventually burn out so in this example and it depends on what you consider a simple vacation i would consider that actually probably an investment especially if it makes you more relaxed it eases your brain it allows you to become more creative and more productive for society that could be an investment thats why i think its important that people dont overwork now what if i were to take me and my family and we were to have someone carry us or we rode on someones back as they swam across the ocean to go stay in golden thrones while an army of people danced for us right so lets say an extravagant vacation so you could argue a lot of things this is i have a family of four and lets say it costs me  well here theres a couple things there might be some part of this vacation that makes you more relaxed and might make you more productive id argue that it is probably the opposite the extravagant vacation is probably going to make you more stressed and probably feed your ego in ways that are in some ways selfdestructive but lets say that there is some component lets stick to the benefit of the doubt that does relax you and i would say that that component is an investment but you know what you probably could have gotten that for  so we could say that  of this is something of an investment and that  of this probably is consumption because its not making you more productive sure enough when you go to this place it is giving those people something to do and it is giving them jobs but i would call that a transfer of wealth this isnt investment when you go to whatever country you decide to go to and you blow essentially  that you didnt need to just because it feels good to have the locals dote on you youre transferring money to them and then maybe they transfer that money to someone else but it in no way is increasing the wealth of the world its not leading to innovation its not leading to more factories and its not leading to the pie getting bigger and you know what i dont even think this is necessarily a bad idea because frankly this is just the transfer of wealth from someone who needs ego gratification to a transfer of wealth from someone whos willing to do fairly simple things to essentially take that wealth from them but at the end of the day it is consumption and i think you can imagine lets say a simple purse my wife goes out and buys a purse from target and it costs  is that consumption or is that an investment well id argue that thats an investment maybe her old purse is falling apart and by having a new purse maybe it helps her get a job be more productive maybe it helps her get more organized so this could be an investment and what about a louis vuitton not to pick on them in particular but what about a louis vuitton purse i dont know how much they i dont even know how to spell it i think these cost upwards of  or whatever well this clearly is some form of consumption you could maybe make some argument that in certain circles you could get a job if you carry around one of these purses but theres some basic core value to it that you probably could have gotten with a simple purse so that maybe is  of investment and then the rest of it i dont know the other  is consumption now ill ask you a further question do you think that this is bad or good for society well id actually argue that its probably neutral for society because it does look like a quote unquote waste of money this extra almost  that you spent that you really didnt have to to get something of fairly basic utility but that those resources werent burned those resources went from frankly someone who just wanted some ego gratification it went from someones ego essentially so lets say this is you or your ego and this is louis vuitton the company so you gave them  that you didnt have to their cost of making the purse probably didnt cost a lot more than that simple purse and in exchange they gave you ego gratification so they really didnt have to waste a lot of resources they gave you all of this brand imagery that makes you feel better about yourself so i would argue that this capital actually didnt get lost it just got transferred from someone who was probably a little insecure to someone who knows how to sell to insecure people and then louis vuitton will then have that  and then who knows maybe they give that to their private equity friend or their venture capital friend and then that gets invested in some new startup idea some solarcell company that actually can create energy from the sun and in which case that money did not go wasted so they might actually invest it in solar so this actually was not a waste of money although this transaction i would agree is consumption i would say that the waste of money is all of the advertising and all the sponsorship that louis vuitton has to do to convince you that this will make you somehow a better person if you buy that purse because those ads you see on tv with those people you want to look like that will not give you that is not creating any net wealth for the world or is not making the pie any bigger anyway let me think of another example here well lets say so this example with the louis vuitton purse this is just a transfer of wealth but lets say instead of doing that you had your ego and instead of buying a louis vuitton purse you just so this is you you thought it would be nice but lets say you thought it was nice instead of buying a louis vuitton purse which we established would just be a transfer of wealth it is consumption but at least that money doesnt disappear lets say that you wanted to pay  to have i dont know  an hour you can have  people dance for you and recite your name and talk about what an amazing person you are this i would argue is pure consumption because those  people sure this money gets transferred to them but they didnt do anything productive with that time right those  people they could have been tilling the soil they could have been working in a factory they could have been teaching their children how to read they could have been doing something that was productive for society but instead they spent one hour dancing for you for your ego gratification and this is in my mind the worst form of consumption because not only its not just the transfer of wealth it is the destruction of wealth because  peoples time is wealth that is capital that could be used to improve someones life but instead this  was essentially destroyed sure it goes to those people right but in the end they didnt create anything in that amount of time and ill touch more about that anyway in essence the amount of money didnt change in the system but the amount of value in the system got degraded because all these people time got wasted and in the end that actually leads to inflation if you have more money in a system with less productive goods and services the price for our productive goods and services goes up but anyway im out of time again but i encourage you to think as much as you can about just this idea when you spend money is it consumption or is it investment and ill continue this more into kind of a lot of what the government tells you to do when the economy goes down how they say go by yourself a nice dress instead of saying hey why dont you go build a factory or why dont you save your money and invest in your childs education anyway see you in the next videoinvestment vs consumption wealth destruction up nextwealth destruction  investment and consumption video  khan academy if youre seeing this message it

accounting for gdpmeasuring the size of the economy gross domestic productbeyond gdp other ways to measure the economy next tutorialreal and nominal gdpvideo transcriptwhat i want to do in this video is compare investment to consumption and were going to think about it in two contexts one i would call the everyday conventional context and then the other one would be how we would think about it in an economics context because these words mean something very particular to an economist and thats important that it means something particular because were going to start using these words or this terminology or these classifications to understand where gdp is coming from so in everyday let me draw a line over here this is going to be everyday or conversational versions of this term and down here well put the economics the economic versions of this term especially when we think of it in the context of accounting for gdp and theyre not necessarily all that different but they are different in important ways so in investment really in both cases you can generally view it as something that you do to get some future gain so for example if i today build a house so i build a house so that is the house i built it today and this will be the timeline the house will keep lasting and its an investment because its going to be giving me future gain a year from now ill still be able to live in that house so i will have the saved rent thats a future gain a future gain two years from now itll keep giving some type of gain you could have a financial instrument maybe some type of debt instrument youre lending money to someone else so maybe you buy a bond which is essentially you lending money to someone else that is an investment in the everyday sense of it because when have that asset when youve bought that asset its going to pay off something in the future its going to pay off some interest or some profits and in the everyday sense i would consider something like hopefully it would be going to college would be an investment so education ill say education because you invest that time and energy and education its going to keep paying off hopefully by doing that youre going to get better employment and higher wages the rest of your life it will keep paying off so this is the everyday notion of investment the everyday notion of consumption the way i think about it is you are buying something or youre doing something that youre just going to use up in the shortterm and just by using it up whatever that object is if you just use it up and its just going to hopefully benefit you in some way but its more of a shortterm thing i would consider that consumption in the everyday sense so if you go buy a candy bar and eat it you have consumed the candy bar you have not made an investment if you go to a movie that is consumption and im not making any value judgment that one is better than the other investment at the end of the day youre investing so that you can get future benefit that could lead to consumption because at the end of the day consumption is one of the things that might make your life a little bit better off so im not saying that one is better than the other but watching a movie that would also be consumption spending time buying a book well you could debate whether thats education or not but lets say you buy a book that is not educational that is consumption but it is making you happier hopefully its making your life better in some way now the economic definitions are related to these everyday definitions but theyre a little bit more precise and they make the definitions in a way that theyre easier to account for if you are a nation theyre easier to keep track of so the way an economist would define it they would define economic investment as spending on capital equipment capital equipment are things like if you are a factory you will buy the equipment to run your factory you buy the robots and you buy the assembly line and you buy the wheelbarrows or whatever else the things that have to cart things around that is capital equipment it would be things like inventory so for example the inventory and this is still not so different both of these things are being used to produce things in the future to produce future benefit youre buying that inventory sometimes raw material youre going to add value to it and then theyre going to be used to produce something in the future it includes things like even the structures the buildings and so for all of this in the economic sense and this is why its easier to account for this for the most part is being done by the firms and it also includes the one thing that households do which is construction of new homes this is from the households actually the buying of a house does not show up in consumption or investment because nothing new was produced something just exchanged hands so whenever we talk about any of these things especially when were talking about it in precise economic terms its the production of new capital equipment new inventory new structures new homes if i just buy a factory from someone else that does not add to gdp it would not be considered investment or consumption because im just transferring an asset from one person to another it would only be added to gdp when it is first created and on the consumption side from an economic point of view let me draw a little bit of a line right over here consumption is considered to be any spending on final goods by households except for new homes and let me make this even clearer because remember if were just transferring goods that shouldnt count so let me put it on newly produced final goods now whats unintuitive a little bit over here is according to the way we account for gdp the tuition that you spend on a college education that is new spending on final goods and here are the final goods or services the service youre getting is your education that would be consumption so education would fall here in the economic sense while in the every day sense i would consider education right over here maybe you are buying a car and youre not buying a car for leisure purposes youre buying a car because you need your car to go to work theres an argument that that would be an investment in the everyday sense by having that car you have something that can take you to work every day so youre getting future benefit so theres an argument that maybe thats an investment in the everyday sense but in the accounting sense that car would sit right here you bought a new car but that is considered consumption you did not buy a new house and the whole reason at least as far as i understand why its set up this way is this is this easier to account for you look at all of the spending by firms thats easy to account for you essentially call that investment because at the end of the day all the spending that firms are making is theyre doing it to produce some good or service so we call this investment any spending that the firms do and on top of that when households purchase new homes we also call that investment and thats just easier for the accounting offices of governments to keep track of and everything else that households do we consider consumption and well see in the next few videos there are a few other categories in terms of things that the government do and then well have to think about imports and exportsincome and expenditure views of gdpup nextincome and expenditure views of gdp coursera  online courses from top universities join for free

reward introductionhuman capitalreturn on capitalinvestment vs consumption investment vs consumption wealth destruction wealth destruction backofenvelope office space conundrumvideo transcriptive been wanting to make a video on a couple of terms that people have really thrown around for a while now and i think it really hits the core of some of the issues were dealing with now with the credit debacle but its kind of at a deeper level so the things i want to go over are the ideas of savings consumption and investment and you hear these a lot everyone obviously says ive invested in the stock market or ive invested in a house and i really want to give you a framework for how i think about these ideas and frankly i havent seen them depicted this way in any economics book although theyve kind of touched on this but i think this is really how you should think about these things so if you save money and i think we all know what that means thats money that you didnt spend theres a couple of things that you can do with it you can either consume your money or you could invest your money so lets just think about a bunch of different situations and think about whether those things are consumption or investment so lets say i have  that im dealing with so lets say i take that  and i build a factory and i think that that factory is going to be able to produce ill make up some product itll be able to produce cars more efficiently and cheaper than any other car factory out there well i think wed all agree that this is an investment and why is it an investment because im taking this  and im putting it to some use that is creating hopefully more value than my original  in fact im expecting some type of a return on this investment and ive made a bunch of videos on what a return on investment is and you can usually quantify it if i take a  and i build this factory and this factory spits out  a year its probably creating at least  a year value assuming that nothing corrupt is happening in our system in fact its normally creating more than  a year of value it may be creating a  a year of value and  of that may be going to the person whos doing the production and then the other half of the value is actually going to the consumer of whatever this factory is making and you have to think about it because if all of the value went to the person who produced the factory then theres not a huge incentive for someone to use his products anymore but anyway thats not the topic of discussion were just trying to get at a mental framework on what consumption is versus investment so i think we all agree that if i were to build a factory that this is lets say ill do everything in green as investment so building a factory is an investment now lets say that im homeless and i have this  and because im homeless i dont have a place to go and eat dinner and rest and relax because i dont have that i cant get a job and i cant become a productive member of society so maybe im going to use this  to buy a simple house that meets all of my needs lets say build a simple house and ill do that in a neutral color this is my other use of this  instead of building a factory im going to build a simple house and this house it provides shelter for me and my family it allows us that security that now my kids can go to school and they can themselves become more productive citizens i now have an address i have a place to take a shower that allows me to go get a job and i can now create value for society as a whole instead of being on the corner and begging for money from people i would argue that this is also an investment why is it because im taking this  that maybe i had or someone gave to me and its generating a return and what is that return well with a factory its maybe a little easier to quantify but at minimum its this work that im able to do because i now have a house because i have the security i have the address i have the shelter im able to relax its that security and its also the return that probably my kids are going to be able to now contribute to society maybe if they grew up homeless they would have never been able to contribute and now that they have a roof over their head and are able to go to school et cetera they are going to be able to give some economic value back to society its hard to value maybe i didnt have any job before and now i have a job and i can contribute  a year to society maybe im working at someones factory maybe im providing some other maybe im a farmer now whatever im providing some source of value and maybe my kids if they never got an education they would have maybe added  of value per year to people and now they can add  of value so that difference would also be some of the return on this investment so i also consider this to be an investment now my question to you is lets say that i already had a house so this is an investment lets say i already had a house and my family is happy and we have everything we need we have food on the table and my kids go to school and im able to get a job and all of that exists but lets say i still have a  and i use that  ill do it in yellow to put in some granite counter tops i have some money left over lets say im going to add a bathroom to my house and i will put the latest hardwood floors so that my family will be impressed you can imagine and maybe i add  square feet you normally cant get all that for a  but i think youll bear with me so im essentially doing some major home improvements so my question to you is is this an investment or is this consumption now in our everyday world with most people we deal with they will call this investment in my house and why are they saying that because they say by spending a  in the house in this way that maybe if you watch the home and garden channel theyre doing this all the time that if you pour this a  into your house that maybe the value of your house is going to increase by  or someone else all of a sudden is going to perceive the value of your house as being  theyll say well you got a  return on investment id argue that that is not investment that its speculation you are essentially piling money into this stuff and ill do this in red consumption is red whats happening here truly economically when you add granite or you add an extra bathroom or hardwood floors or this extra  square feet is it making anyone whos living in that house more productive is it making you harder working is it making you more likely to invent the cure for cancer or more likely to invent a way of getting cheap energy or produce more widgets no its just if anything providing more things for you to have to take care of that youre not going to be able to focus as much on your work or more energy is going to have to be extended to maintain this type of place to heat and cool a  square foot house so if anything by actually pouring the  here youre actually creating something that is going to suck more out of society in fact in no way is this going to contribute to the collective wealth of society the last two examples i gave contribute to the collective wealth society some of which you share and that is your return on the investment but as a whole this is an investment into society and its going to make the pie bigger this right here does not make the pie bigger it might make you a little bit happier make your ego feel a little bit better let your pride grow and your self righteousness grow and show other people that youve arrived but its not going to increase the wealth of society and when you say that youve invested you are really just saying ive speculated what youre saying is by paying this  youre going to find essentially a greater fool out there they could have done the same thing they could have bought your house spent  and done this if this is what would have made them happy but what youre saying is essentially that youre going to find somebody out there whos willing to pay  extra for something that should have only cost  and in fact if anything if you use this at all the value of this is going to go down so youre just somehow assuming that the granite counter tops that you choose are going to be the taste that someone else would like or that the hardwood floors are going to be the taste someone else would like i would actually argue that when you customize your house in this way you are creating  of consumption to your taste and id be surprised if someone else truly is willing to pay more than  unless theyre being in some way irrational or they can finance this because its part of the mortgage anyway this is i think just the big picture investment adds value to society a simple house adds value to society consumption is something where people might call it an investment because its kind of speculation one might find some other guy willing to emotionally pay more for something but its money thats burned its not creating more value for society i continue

through investmentthe production possibilities frontier and social choicesnext tutorialcomparative advantage and gains from tradevideo transcriptin the last few videos weve been talking about the production possibilities frontier as a relatively static thing something that you couldnt change but you could move along what i want to do in this video is think about maybe there are ways to change or expand the production possibilities frontier and to do that lets assume that our little huntergatherer has decided to become a strict carnivore so hes only focused on rabbits now and his whole happiness in life is optimizing the number of rabbits he can catch and eat in a given day and so lets on one axis lets draw lets say the number of rabbits that he can catch in a given day lets say its        i could keep going on and on so this right over here is rabbits that he can catch in a given day rabbits in a day but remember he wants to optimize this he wants to think about how he can increase his productivity in terms of the number of rabbits and he knows well just assume that he knows how to build rabbit traps so now were going to do a production possibilities frontier not between rabbits and berries but between rabbits and building rabbit traps so rabbit traps so maybe hes able to get twigs together and he builds something puts the twigs together in a little thing its a little box that maybe he puts a little i dont know some type of carrot down over there and then if the rabbit comes then takes the carrot then the box falls on the rabbit or something like that we dont have to go into the particulars of the actual trap but he can also spends his time building rabbit traps so lets say  rabbit trap  rabbit traps and  rabbit traps and lets say were going to hold all other things equal ceteris parabus so were not worrying about other things and as well see in most introductory economics class whenever you do a production possibilities frontier youre only doing it with two dimensions and so thats why you have a regular curve you could have one with three dimensions where youre doing the trade off between three things but then you would have to have a three dimensional graph and essentially the production possibilities frontier would be a surface but lets just focus on this right now maybe ill do a surface in the future just for fun so these are the rabbit traps and lets say the production possibilities frontier between rabbit traps and rabbits look something like this he could spend all his time making rabbit traps but in that case he wont get any rabbits and hell probably starve and that wouldnt be a good scenario or he could spend all of this time hunting for rabbits and he would catch on average  rabbits per day but that would leave him no time to make rabbit traps so this is our current production possibilities let me just draw it this is our current production possibilities frontier so ill call this p production possibilities frontier and ill put a little  subscript there thats our starting point so he can he can sit anywhere over here and he would have achieved productive efficiency anywhere on this curve but as we saw if he just spent all of his time doing this over here hell never get any rabbit traps and so he wont be able to change the productive possibility frontier but what happens if instead he decides that he does want to build some rabbit traps so he decreases the number of rabbits a day to  and that allows him to make  rabbit trap per day so he wants to hang out in this scenario so every day that goes by on average hes going to make  rabbits and hes going to build a rabbit trap so whats going to happen so as we go into maybe into the next period he would now have a rabbit trap after just one day that he can use to help catch rabbits so that will actually change the production possibilities frontier so if he makes this investment it will actually allow him in a given amount of time to actually catch more rabbits so if he does that the production possibilities frontier having a rabbit trap wont make him that much wont allow him to make more rabbit traps in a day so the most rabbit traps he can make in a day is still going to be  but maybe now he can catch  rabbits a day so now it might look something like that so now he could either stop making rabbit traps and catch  a day just with that  rabbit trap he has or he could continue that and now actually he can catch  rabbits a day and still make  rabbit trap a day and maybe he decides to do that but it could be anywhere along this production possibilities frontier or he could say hey im happy eating the  rabbits a day im going to make  rabbit traps now every day and now after another period he gets even more productive and so then the production so let me call this one this is after one day production possibilities frontier after one day and then after two days lets say he did this scenario right over here now hes produce  rabbit traps and obviously maybe im exaggerating how quickly his productivity would grow but maybe now the new production possibilities frontier looks something like this he now has  rabbit traps or he has  more rabbit traps he already had  so now he has  rabbit traps after two days and so now if he wanted to devote themselves purely to rabbit trapping he can get  rabbits a day or he could do some combination in between and actually this curve it shouldnt go up at all i dont want to give you the impression that it went up and then down it just goes kind of straight and does something like that right over here so this right over here ill call that the production possibilities frontier  so what this huntergatherer is doing in this scenario right here is he is making an investment he is accumulating capital this right over here this is capital he is choosing instead of to consume all of his resources so theres two things he can do he can either spend all of his time in pure consumption getting as many rabbits as possible a day and then eating them all pure consumption or he could reduce his consumption and then allocate some of his resources towards and investment so this right over here this is an investment it makes him more productive this right over here is consumption theres some base level of consumption he needs to survive but if he invests then it increases his overall productive capacity so if you viewed him as an economy by himself by investing instead of consuming all of his resources by investing some of his resources and in this case his resources are his time and his expertise by investing some of them hes able to increase his productivity and if you viewed him as an economy hes experiencing economic growth and so theres multiple types of investments and well talk about these in multiple videos in this case he is doing capital accumulation he is building tools that will make him more productive another type of investment is essentially technological change technological improvement which would actually make his tools even better so we could maybe draw another production possibilities frontier between making rabbit traps and then doing rd on inventing new types of rabbit traps and so he could decide which of those two things he wants to decide between but what i wanted you to just appreciate in this video is that the production possibilities frontier can change you can become more productive if you do have investment in rd or capital accumulation and in this case that just happened to be rabbit trapsallocative efficiency and marginal benefitthe production possibilities frontier and social choicesup nextthe production possibilities frontier and social choices investment  wikipedia investment from wikipedia

or both over a period of time investment generally results in acquiring an asset also called an investment if the asset is available at a price worth investing it is normally expected either to generate income or to appreciate in value so that it can be sold at a higher price or both investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments financial assets range from lowrisk

invested whereas in saving such as in a bank deposit the risk of loss in nominal value is normally remote note that if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holders home currency then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavorably so that the value in the account holders home currency of the savings account decreases speculation involves a level of risk which is greater than most investors would generally consider justified by the expected return an alternative characterization of speculation is its shortterm opportunistic nature famous investorsedit investors famous for their success include warren buffett in march  forbes magazine warren buffett ranked number  in their forbes  list buffett has advised in numerous articles and interviews that a good investment strategy is long term and choosing the right assets to invest in requires due diligence edward o thorp was a highly successful hedge fund manager in the s and s who spoke of a similar approach the investment principles of both of these investors have points in common with the kelly criterion for money management numerous interactive calculators which use the kelly criterion can be found online intermediaries and collective investmentsedit investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions these intermediaries include pension funds banks and insurance companies they may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts unit trusts sicavs etc to make large scale investments each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased subject to charges levied by the intermediary which may be large and varied approaches to investment

establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard to pledged land punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving injury or death in the early s purchasers of stocks bonds and other securities were described in media academia and commerce as speculators by the s the term investment had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time since the last half of the th century the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures value investmentedit main article value investing a value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued and sells overvalued ones to identify undervalued securities a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security value investors employ accounting ratios such as earnings per share and sales growth to identify securities trading at prices below their worth warren buffett and benjamin graham are notable examples of value investors graham and dodds seminal work security analysis was written in the wake of the wall street crash of   the price to earnings ratio pe or earnings multiple is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio with a function of dividing the share price of stock by its earnings per share this will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings this ratio is an important aspect due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies a stock with a lower pe ratio will cost less per share than one with a higher pe taking into account the same level of financial performance therefore it essentially means a low pe is the preferred option an instance in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance is when companies in different industries are compared an example although it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a pe in the low teens in the case of hitech stock a pe in the s range is not unusual when making comparisons the pe ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation for investors paying for each dollar of a companys earnings the pe ratio is a significant indicator but the pricetobook ratio pb is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets in the process of the pb ratio the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets any intangibles such as goodwill are not taken into account it is a crucial factor of the pricetobook ratio due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation of intangibles accordingly the pb could be considered a comparatively conservative metric free cash flow and capital structureedit free cash flow measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors after allowing for reinvestment in working capital and capital expenditure high and rising free cash flow therefore tend to make a company more attractive to investors the debttoequity ratio is an indicator of capital structure a high proportion of debt reflected in a high debttoequity ratio tends to make a companys earnings free cash flow and ultimately the returns to its investors more risky or volatile investors compare a companys debttoequity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry and examine trends in debttoequity ratios and free cash flow ebitdaedit a popular valuation metric is earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda with application for example to valuing unlisted companies and mergers and acquisitions for an attractive investment for example a company competing in a high growth industry an investor might expect a significant acquisition premium above book value or current market value which values the company at several times the most recent ebitda a private equity fund for example may buy a target company for a multiple of its historical or forecasted ebitda perhaps as much as  or  times in certain cases an ebitda may be sacrificed by a company in order for the pursuance of future growth a strategy frequently used by corporate giants such as amazon google and microsoft among others this is a business decision that can impact negatively on buyout offers founded on ebitda and can be the cause of many negotiations failing it may be recognized as a valuation breach with many investors maintaining that sellers are too demanding while buyers are regarded as failing to realize the

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
