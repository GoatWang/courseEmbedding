equity securities may fluctuate in value in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions foreign investments involve greater risks than us investments including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations all of which may be magnified in emerging markets low volatility funds can exhibit relative low volatility and excess returns compared to the index over the long term both portfolio investments and returns may differ from those of the index the fund may not experience lower volatility or provide returns in excess of the index and may provide lower returns in periods of a rapidly rising market active stock selection may lead to added risk in exchange for the potential outperformance relative to the index quantitative investing assumes that future performance of a security relative to other securities may be predicted based on historical economic and financial factors however any errors in a model used might not be detected until the fund has sustained a loss or reduced performance related to such errors
