crawfordjohn crawford iii family united statesjohn crawford iii familyunited statessupporterson august   our lives changed forever our unarmed son john crawford iii was killed by police while shopping at a walmart in beavercreek ohio on this tragic day john was shopping like any other customer in the store he was looking at a few items on the shelf holding a toy bb gun he might buy and talking on his phone with the mother of his two children other customers shopped near our son showing no sign that john was any kind of threat while he shopped everything was normal until officer sean williams suddenly began shooting him without any warning in the video above you can see this was a heinous and unjustifiable killing  we fought for months to get ohio attorney general mike dewine to release that surveillance footage to the public and while the video shows our unarmed son being ruthlessly killed mr dewine’s office delayed the grand jury and then presented a halfhearted case against officer williams so we were not surprised that the grand jury declined to bring charges against williams the reckless and dangerous officer who was also involved in a  fatal shooting for which he was never prosecuted  we may be delayed but we wont be denied we wont stop until we receive justice for our son the us justice department is currently conducting a civil rights investigation into john’s case we believe that the video footage clearly demonstrates that it is time for the federal prosecutor to bring charges against officer williams  this may be our last chance to do so and we need your

destroyed oklahomas oldest insurance company by michael bates on august    pm  permalink  comments   trackbacks  update midnight  nearly  oklahoma republicans voted in the runoff and  of them voted for john doak congratulations to mr doak and the oklahoma gop this years turnout is only slightly lower than the  runoff which was dominated by the highprofile expensive and fierce runoff for lt governor between scott pruitt and todd hiett turnout was up almost  in the th congressional district runoff about  voted in the  runoff between mary fallin and mick cornett while about  voted in this years james lankford vs kevin calvey bout fallin beat cornett  lankford beat calvey  theres always the danger in a minor election especially that people will vote for someone with a familiar name thats a problem if the name is familiar for the wrong reasons how else can you explain a first place primary finish for john crawford the former oklahoma insurance commissioner who was the subject of a federal corruption investigation james l harlin fsa clu chfc flmi maaa was an informant to the fbi during its investigation of john p crawford during his term as oklahoma insurance commissioner from  to  last week harlin spoke to the oklahoma conservative political action committee ocpac charlie meadows ocpac chairman sent harlins statement out to his email list if youd like to subscribe to the ocpacs weekly email newsletter send a note to mr meadows at charliemeadows at gmail dot com harlin alleges that crawford as midcontinent life actuary created an actuarially unsound insurance product then as insurance commissioner interfered with the sale of the company abused his power to seize the company destroyed the company and hundreds of oklahoma jobs and deterred other investment in oklahoma by an outside company crawfords official actions according to harlin convinced them that oklahoma was a corrupt backwater of cronyism oklahoma republicans need to show up at the polls today august   and vote for john doak for insurance commissioner doak has strong industry experience is a conservative and has a sterling reputation he will be a strong standardbearer in the november election crawfords name on the ballot would not only kill our chances of having a prolife antiobamacare insurance commissioner but its likely to stain the entire republican ticket here is mr harlins statement john crawford  midcontinent life august   purpose to share my direct experience with john crawford when he was insurance commissioner to defeat crawford in the primary runoff august  because there is a strong chance that the republican nominee will become the next commissioner opening there are numerous examples of john crawfords incompetence cronyism and corruption these include his weak credentials as an actuary channeling money to his son in a dubious technology scheme having his chief of staff raise campaign funds while on the payroll of a company he illegally seized fbi investigations etc mcl however i want to focus on midcontinent life insurance company mcl was the oldest insurance company incorporated in the state of oklahoma and was formed by the stewart family around the time of statehood mcl operated successfully for over  years in the traditional life insurance business in the late s a group of mcl managers designed a new product called extra life that tried to take advantage of the hyperinflation and inordinately high interest rates caused by the financial mayhem created by the carter administration that mayhem is being repeated today by obama but thats a story for another day the actuary for mcl at the time this product was created was john crawford he certified the financial strength of the company the integrity of the dividends and the pricing of the products he did this certification every single year up until  he did this even though the economic circumstances changed during the regan years to the point that the dividends and the pricing of the product were no longer sustainable in  florida power bought mcl seeing florida powers financial resources crawford decided to increase his fees tenfold at this point crawford was summarily fired in the early s crawford ran as a democrat for congress i remember meeting crawford at the park in crescent on the fourth of july when he was running and lost in  he switched parties and rode in on the coattails of gov keating to become the insurance commissioner a new management team arrived at mcl in   years after the extra life product was launched within  months this new management team discovered the problem of unsustainable dividends and pricing in the product the management team laid out a course of action to correct the problems in order to maintain the solvency of the company in  the point was reached of needing to cut the dividends and raise the rates this plan was contractually allowed within the provisions of the policy and was later judged by the court to be the proper course of action in early  as a standard of protocol the management team presented the plan to crawford in a confidential meeting four days later mcls president received a solicitation along with an offer of a bribe from a friend of crawfords to channel the company to him the friend in conjunction with crawfords support the mcl president refused and reported the incident to florida power officials two months later crawford abused his power as commissioner to seize the company he demanded that florida power pay millions of dollars to cover up the financial shortfall that he had mishandled when he was the company actuary statements from people at the time of his firing showed this was crawfords way of getting retribution against florida power crawford removed the entire mcl management team and proceeded to try to prosecute them and their lawyers even though none of them designed the product or certified to the financial integrity of the company for the nearly two decades prior to their arrival that prosecution was ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence each member of the mcl management team went on to establish very successful careers the president became the chairman president  ceo of chase insurance the largest bank insurance enterprise in america mcls general counsel became the general counsel for the national association of insurance commissioners he now oversees the legal framework for the entire us insurance industry for every state in the country the chief actuary is now the chief actuary of the largest tpa in america the chief financial officer became the cfo of a large oklahoma company the marketing officer became the president of several international insurance companies this was a superb management team with outstanding credentials and an impeccable record of performance excellence because of john crawford mcl no longer exists hundreds of oklahoma jobs were lost the insurance industry considers oklahoma a backwater for doing business florida power had an opportunity to invest  million in a power related industry in oklahoma they passed on this investment because of their treatment by crawford and his cronies the mcl president had firsthand knowledge that florida power shared their dim view of oklahoma with many of their fortune  friends so bottom line all the headlines of corruption cronyism and incompetence surrounding john crawford are vividly real oklahoma consumers the insurance industry and oklahoma businesses cannot afford a repeat of crawford as insurance commissioner it is imperative to defeat crawford in this primary runoff on august  here are charlie meadowss comments on the doakcrawford runoff john doak has a great deal of experience in a variety of levels in the insurance industry he is a solid conservative and i believe a man of high moral character and integrity which is a most important qualification for this office the insurance commissioner has enormous regulatory powers over both small and very large businesses and as such the person must be above reproach i believe his opponent john crawford to be corrupt a charlatan and an opportunist he was the first republican elected to this position on the coattails of frank keatings election to governor during his one term in office before voters sent him packing in  his office was under numerous allegations of fraud nepotism mismanagement and corruption the liberal democrat incumbent kim holland really wants john crawford to become the nominee as she will have a field day bringing up all those very serious allegations from the past she will have a difficult time defeating john doak but crawford is so bad i will even vote for holland over crawford if he is the nominee as the republican party can not afford to put a suspected crook in office with a r by his name categories oklahomapolitics tags insurance commissoner john crawford john doak  trackbacks listed below are links to blogs that

for john crawford iii’s family or another group could ask a judge to find probable cause against beavercreek police in the august  fatal shooting at the beavercreek walmart tom hagel university of dayton school of law professor emeritus said friday “theoretically yes” he told dayton daily news staff writer mark gokavi “because double jeopardy is not attached” to the grand jury process employing such an strategy led a cleveland municipal judge to find probable cause that two police officers broke the law in the shooting death of yearold tamir rice at a park in november  local activists known as the “cleveland ” sought the citizens motion known as an “affidavit of person having knowledge of offense” they said because they had lost confidence in the grand jury investigation the ruling is only advisory whether charges are pursued will be up to cuyahoga county and cleveland prosecutors “in terms of why citizens would do this again i can’t read their minds but it might be that no  it keeps the case alive and in public view” hagel said crawford  of fairfield was shot by officer sean williams dispatched to the store after a  caller said a black male was waving a rifle at people including children crawford had picked up a bbpellet rifle from an opened box in the store and walked around with it as he talked on his phone police said they twice told crawford to drop the item
