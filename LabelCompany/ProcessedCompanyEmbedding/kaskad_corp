anticipated the various offering amounts presented are for illustrative purposes only and the actual amount of proceeds rose if any may differ significantly the above figures represent only estimated costs if substantially less than the maximum proceeds are obtained piotr sibov our president and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process also these

guarantee that he will loan such funds to us mr sibov will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering there are some barriers of entry in the scratch products market these barriers include need for the capital to start up such as equipment building and raw materials customer loyalty when large incumbent firms may have existing customers loyal to established products or exclusive agreements with key links in the supply chain could make it difficult for other manufacturers to enter an industry we need proceeds from this offering to enter this business we will be in a market where we compete with other companies offering similar products there are several companies dedrax ltd  passat press  and classic design  we will be in direct competition with them many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us we will likely lose business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for scratch products than us which may also cause us to lose business we foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants we may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations kaskad corp has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date once we have entered the market we will be one of many participants in the scratch products business many established yet well financed entities are currently active in the market nearly all kaskad corps competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than kaskad corp we are consequently at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such products and become a successful company in the scratch products industry therefore kaskad corp may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all  httpdedraxcom

subadvisers without the necessity of obtaining shareholder approval   frequently asked questions   q           what proposals are shareholders being asked to consider at the upcoming shareholder meeting   a            shareholders are being asked to consider six separate matters proposal  seeks the election by shareholders of the series each a fund and collectively the funds of the hartford mutual funds inc hmf and the hartford mutual funds ii inc hmf ii each a company and together the companies of nine individuals to each companys board of directors each a board and together the boards proposal  seeks approval of a new investment management agreement between hartford funds management company llc hfmc and the companies on behalf of the funds proposals   and  seek approval of certain changes to each funds fundamental investment restrictions with respect to i the purchase or sale of commodities ii the purchase or sale of real estate and iii concentration of investments in a particular industry or group of industries respectively finally proposal  seeks the approval prospectively of a modification to the current manager of managers policy previously approved by shareholders to permit hfmc subject to prior approval by the relevant board and under certain circumstances to enter into and materially amend agreements with affiliated subadvisers without the necessity of obtaining shareholder approval under the current sec order hfmc may for certain funds enter into and amend agreements with subadvisors that are not affiliates of hfmc subject to prior board approval and under certain circumstances   q           who is being nominated to serve as directors   a            shareholders are being asked to consider the election of hilary e ackermann lynn s birdsong james e davey christine detrick duane e hill sandra s jaffee william p johnston phillip o peterson and lemma w senbet each a nominee and together the nominees as directors with the exception of ms detrick the nominees are current members of each board if each of the nominees is elected to each board the boards will be composed of the same nine directors     q           how were the nominees chosen   a            each companys nominating and governance committee is responsible for screening and recommending candidates to the board the nominating and governance committees are comprised of all of the directors who are not interested persons of the companies as that term is defined in the investment company act of  as amended the  act the nominating and governance committees recommended each nominee and at a meeting on november   the nominees were unanimously nominated by the boards to stand for election   q           why am i being asked to approve a new investment management agreement   a            section a of the  act provides that no person may serve as an investment adviser to a fund except pursuant to a written contract that among other things has been approved by a vote of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities as defined in the  act material changes to existing advisory contracts are deemed to effectively create new advisory contracts that require shareholder approval the proposed new investment management agreement between hfmc and the companies the new agreement would enhance and clarify the description of services currently provided by hfmc under the investment management agreements between hmf and hfmc and hmf ii and hfmc the current agreements while the boards do not view the differences between the current agreements and the new agreement to be material the boards are asking shareholders to approve the new agreement if approved by shareholders the new agreement would not result in an increase in overall fees paid by the funds     q           why am i being asked to approve changes to each funds fundamental investment restriction on the purchase or sale of commodities   a            the  act requires mutual funds to have certain fundamental investment policies that can only be changed by shareholder vote including a policy on investments in commodities the current fundamental policy on commodities for many of the funds has been in place for a long time and the funds are proposing to modernize it to provide for flexibility and the ability to adapt to a changing regulatory environment  this proposal also would result in all of the funds having the same fundamental policy on commodities  we expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies described in each funds prospectus and the boards and hfmc have no current intention to change the way in which any fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment policy   for many of the funds the current policy states that the funds will not purchase or sell commodities or commodities contracts except that the funds may purchase or sell financial futures contracts options on financial futures contracts and futures contracts forward contracts and options with respect to foreign currencies and may enter into swap transactions or other financial transactions of any kind certain funds have adopted a more flexible policy which allows these funds to purchase or sell commodities or commodities contracts to the extent permitted by applicable law and as set forth in each funds registration statement which includes the prospectus proposal  would give all of the funds the ability to invest in commoditiesrelated instruments to the extent permitted under the  act and consistent with applicable laws rules and regulations interpretations and the funds registration statements hfmc is not proposing to allow the funds to purchase or sell physical commodities again we expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies of any fund and the boards and hfmc have no current intention to change the way in which any fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment restriction   q           why am i being asked to approve changes to each funds fundamental investment restriction on the purchase or sale of real estate   a            the  act requires mutual funds to have a fundamental policy on investments in real estate the proposed changes in proposal  are intended to modernize each funds existing fundamental investment policy on the purchase or sale of real estate and provide flexibility in the event of future changes to the regulatory environment  all of the funds are part of this proposal to retain consistency across the funds   we expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies described in each funds prospectus and the boards and hfmc have no current intention to change the way in which any fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment policy   the current policy states that the funds will not purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments although each fund may purchase securities secured by real estate or interests therein or securities issued by companies which invest in real estate or interests therein proposal  would clarify the funds existing fundamental policy on the purchase or sale of real estate and provide flexibility in the event of future changes to the regulatory environment again we expect that these changes would have no effect on the investment strategies of any fund and the boards and hfmc have no current intention to change the way in which any fund is managed as a result of the changes to the fundamental investment policy   q           why am i being asked to approve changes to each funds fundamental investment restriction on concentration   a            the  act requires mutual funds to establish and disclose in their registration statements a fundamental policy that restricts a funds ability to concentrate its investments in a particular industry or group of industries the current policy for the funds refers to the us securities and exchange commissions sec interpretation of the meaning of the term concentrate which generally involves investments of more than  of a funds assets it is proposed that the term concentrate be described with a reference to the  act and the rules thereunder as they may be interpreted or modified from time to time by regulatory authorities having appropriate jurisdiction proposal  would allow the funds to take advantage of any future changes in the law or interpretations of what it means for a fund to concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries in addition approval of proposal  would clarify that a funds conversion to a fund of funds or masterfeeder structure would be permissible in the future if hfmc and the board believe such a change would be appropriate   q           why are shareholders being asked to approve a proposal to permit hfmc to select and contract with subadvisers without shareholder approval   a            under section a of the  act an investment manager to a mutual fund cannot enter into or materially amend a sub advisory agreement without obtaining shareholder approval with the exception of the hartford growth allocation fund and the hartford checks and balances fund shareholders have previously approved the funds reliance on a manager of managers exemptive order the existing order from that requirement and certain other requirements under the  act and the rules thereunder therefore many hartford funds historically have operated under a manager of managers structure utilizing both affiliated and unaffiliated subadvisers as part of both single and multiple subadviser arrangements hfmc has significant experience in overseeing subadvisers under such arrangements the existing order among other things allows hfmc with the relevant boards approval and without shareholder approval to enter into and materially amend subadvisory agreements with subadvisers that are not affiliated with the investment manager or those funds other than the hartford growth allocation fund and the hartford checks and balances fund shareholders of the funds have previously approved the funds operation under this structure     hfmc and the companies have requested exemptive relief from the sec that would extend the existing order to also cover subadvisers that are indirect or direct whollyowned subsidiaries of hfmc as defined in the  act or sister companies of hfmc that are whollyowned subsidiaries of a company that indirectly or directly wholly owns hfmc the new order although hfmc does not currently utilize a subadviser in its management of all of the funds and does not utilize a whollyowned subsidiary subadviser for any fund the boards believe that it is in the funds best interests for hfmc to have the flexibility to do so in the future with the relevant boards approval the boards believe that permitting hfmc to select and contract with subadvisers without incurring the delay and expense involved with obtaining shareholder approval of new subadvisory agreements or material amendments to existing subadvisory agreements is appropriate and in the best interest of each funds shareholders and will allow each fund to operate more efficiently there is no guarantee that the sec will grant the new order by prospectively approving this proposal shareholders are approving the operation of the funds in a manager of managers structure under any such terms or conditions necessary to satisfy the conditions of any relief provided by the sec including potential future relief that may apply to any affiliated subadviser   in summary most funds operate under the existing order which permits the funds to select and enter into subadvisory agreements with unaffiliated subadvisers without shareholder approval  if approved by shareholders proposal  would extend this policy so that all of the funds could select and enter into subadvisory agreements with both affiliated and nonaffiliated subadvisers without shareholder approval subject to the conditions of the new order   q           will the proposals result in higher total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver andor expense limitation for any fund   a            no the proposals are not expected to result in an increase in total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver andor expense reimbursement for any fund as shown in the respective funds prospectus   q           who will pay the costs incurred in connection with the meeting   a            each fund will pay its proportionate share of the expenses relating to the enclosed notice and joint proxy statement and the meeting including printing mailing solicitation vote tabulation legal fees and outofpocket expenses these costs are considered extraordinary expenses and are therefore expected to be excluded from any expense limitations currently in effect for any of the funds   q           do the boards recommend that shareholders approve the proposals   a            yes the boards recommend that you vote for the proposals     q           how can i vote   a            you can vote   by mail complete and return your proxy card in the preaddressed
