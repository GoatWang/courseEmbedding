christology the incarnation according to john scottus eriugena by john f gavin  john panteleimon manoussakisjohn scottus eriugena the brilliant and controversial irishman in the court of charles the bald  the grandson of charlemagne drew upon both the latin and greek patristic traditions in order to present a bold and original christian vision a philosopher theologian translator poet and mystic he may be considered the ideal carolingian renaissance man this volume examines his understanding of the incarnation the enfleshment of the word on the one hand eriugenas christology creatively appropriates traditional categories in order to explain gods philanthropia in creating sustaining and restoring the cosmos on the other hand it also provides a guide for the believers mystical participation in the life of jesus and return to divine union this brilliant intellectual from the socalled dark ages offers much to inspire and perhaps even to startle contemporary theologians philosophers and believers who ponder the mystery of the godmadeflesh having illuminated the dark ages the irish genius can still stimulate thomist postkantian and postmodern theologians to contemplate anew the mystery of christ in whom are united time and eternity finite and infinite man and god and by whom original and personal sins are conquered john mcdermott professor of theology sacred heart major seminary michigan a scholarly gem that conveys the treasures of eriugenas complex ninthcentury irish mind with competence and flair gavins scholarship is thorough his writing is a model of lucidity and the manner in which he plans and executes this work serves his project of presenting eriugenas theology of the incarnation perfectly i highly recommend a celtic christology james corkery professor of theology milltown institute ireland too often treated merely as a transitional figure between patristic and medieval thought or as interesting solely for his philosophical cosmology john gavin does an immense service in this fine monograph not only of giving eriugena his own fair hearing but showcasing his littlestudied christology gavin masterfully unfolds eriugenas insights into the nature of christs embodiment its cosmic and salvific effects and the new mode of human being grounded in his historical incarnation paul m blowers dean e walker professor of church history emmanuel christian seminary tennessee in this brilliantly lucid and profoundly insightful book john gavin successfully demonstrates the pervasive christocentrism of eriugenas vision as well as his indebtedness to the greek patristic tradition especially maximus the confessor the result is not only a groundbreaking revisionist achievement in the scholarly assessment of eriugena but the retrieval of a richly creative and hitherto underappreciated voice in the christian tradition khaled anatolios professor of historical theology boston college massachusetts john f gavin sj is an assistant professor in the department of religious studies of the college of the holy cross worcester massachusetts he is the author of and they are like the angels in the heavens angelology and
