therapeutic approach biovie’s biv could potentially yield a breakthrough approach to treating ascites due to liver cirrhosis with the goal of directly targeting its “mechanistic source ” the active agent in our technology is a potent vasoconstrictor and has shown efficacy for reducing portal hypertension in studies around the world the goal is to interrupt the ascites disease pathway thereby halting the “vicious cycle” of accelerating fluid generation reducing ascites formation promises to improve patients’ quality of life and potentially avoid certain lifethreatening complications however unless the patient is able to regain liver function for example if an alcoholic quits drinking he or she may eventually require a liver transplant biv development status the company held a preinvestigational new drug “preind” meeting with the fda regarding biv in early  and received guidance for an upcoming ind submission the company’s new drug candidate could potentially commence us clinical trials as early as  the active ingredient in biv is a compound which many us physicians who specialize in liver disease are familiar with even though it is not yet available in the us it has been studied extensively overseas in related conditions and its efficacy and safety profile has been elucidated by hundreds of scientific publications it is approved in about  countries to treat esophageal variceal bleeds a frequent complication of liver cirrhosis and in some countries for treating type  hospitalized hepatorenal syndrome these conditions share a similar root cause – portal hypertension – and are often accompanied by ascites intellectual property biovie relies on a combination of trade secrecy and patent strategy to protect our confidential information and seek market exclusivity for our products the company has submitted patent filings for biv technology in the us and japan as well as submitted a pct in europe additionally biovie has applied for us orphan drug designation for its new drug candidate since the number of ascites patients about  americans meets the required patient population size future possibilities based on investigative studies around the world biv has the potential for future applications in other lifethreatening conditions due to liver cirrhosis such as those listed below securing marketing approvals for any of these new uses will require wellcontrolled clinical trials to satisfy the fda andor other countries’ regulatory requirements none of which have commenced at this time esophageal variceal bleed evb the bursting of blood vessels lining the esophagus due to high blood pressure “portal hypertension” in the vein which supplies blood to the liver resulting as a result of advanced liver cirrhosis this situation requires emergency treatment to avoid blood loss and death hepatorenal syndrome hrs as their disease progresses liver cirrhosis patients’ kidneys may begin to fail and this deadly condition may set in it often occurs once a patient no longer responds to offlabel drugs used to control ascites the second stage is called “type  hrs” and requires hospitalization as multiple organ failure and death may occur hyponatremia this term refers to “low salt in the bloodstream” another dangerous condition which can occur as a result of advanced liver cirrhosis possible access to earlystage compounds the company has an agreement with pharmain corporation bothell wa providing certain limited rights and information on their program to develop novel modified terlipressin compounds although at an early stage these compounds hold the promise of simpler and potentially safer dosing for patients outside the hospital if this program makes significant advances biovie may contact pharmain to explore a licensing

death due to disease in the us killing an estimated  people annually and incurring treatment costs estimated at  billion annually ascites is liver cirrhosis’s most common complication and involves excessive accumulation of fluid in the abdomen which can become lifethreatening in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis patients with ascites suffer a miserable quality of life and frequent infections as well as other complications requiring hospitalization that contribute to their decline liver cirrhosis liver cirrhosis occurs when tissues inside the liver become damaged “fibrotic” which may be due to nash nonalcoholic steatohepatitis alcoholism hepatitis or other causes as the internal damage accumulates the liver begins to “clog up” which impedes blood flow and its ability to clean and purify the blood about  million americans are afflicted with liver cirrhosis this is an illustration of the progression of a healthy liver to liver cirrhosis severe liver cirrhosis complications once liver damage becomes very substantial which may take up to  years or more ascites andor other serious complications may occur ascites is the most common complication involving kidney dysfunction and the accumulation of substantial amounts of fluid in the abdominal cavity this causes much patient suffering and sometimes leads to malnutrition ascites often causes other lifethreatening complications such as infection sepsis and circulatory dysfunction current drug therapies with no medications approved by the fda specifically to treat ascites the prognosis for these patients is very poor certain drugs which have been approved for other medical conditions such as diuretics combined with a saltrestricted diet usually provide symptomatic relief in the initial stages of the disease but as the ascites worsens their efficacy often diminishes biovie is working on a solution to address this critical unmet medical need most experts agree that ascites develops through a sequence of events illustrated by this diagram how does ascites develop high blood pressure in the vein that supplies blood to the liver called “portal hypertension” occurs as increasing liver damage fibrosis impedes blood flow through the liver this causes vasodilation and blood pooling in the central or “splanchnic” region of the body and low blood volume in the arteries the decrease in effective blood volume activates a signaling pathway “neurohormonal systems” which tells the kidneys to retain large amounts of salt and water in an effort to increase blood volume ultimately the retention of excess sodium and water leads to the formation of ascites as these substances “weep” from the liver and lymph system and collect in the patient’s abdomen biv is being developed by biovie with the goal of alleviating the portal hypertension and correcting splanchnic vasodilation thereby increasing effective blood volume and reducing the signals to the kidneys to retain excess salt and
