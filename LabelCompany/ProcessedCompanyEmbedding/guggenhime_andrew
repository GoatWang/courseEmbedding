of compass study demonstrating the corus cad test outperforms myocardial perfusion imaging in overall diagnostic accuracy for obstructive coronary artery disease february   cardiodx announces publication of compass study demonstrating the corus cad test outperforms myocardial perfusion imaging in overall diagnostic accuracy for obstructive coronary artery disease tue feb   am est – study highlights the validity of corus cad as a firstline test to help clinicians exclude obstructive cad as a cause of the patient’s symptoms – palo alto calif  feb   prnewswire — cardiodx inc a pioneer in the field of  cardiovascular genomic diagnostics today announced the publication of the compass coronary  obstruction detection by  molecular personalized gene expression study in  circulation cardiovascular genetics  a journal of the american heart association  results of the prospective multicenter us study showed that  corus®  cad a bloodbased  gene expression test demonstrated high accuracy with both a high negative predictive value  percent and high sensitivity  percent for assessing  obstructive coronary artery disease  cad in a population of patients referred for stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging mpi  the study’s authors conclude that using corus cad earlier in the diagnostic algorithm could reduce the number of invasive cardiac tests by more accurately evaluating the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease compared to the traditional algorithm of stress myocardial perfusion imaging mpi in these patients compass enrolled stable patients with symptoms suggestive of cad who had been referred for mpi at  us sites  a blood sample was obtained in all  patients prior to mpi and corus cad gene expression testing was performed with study investigators blinded to corus cad test results following mpi patients underwent either invasive coronary angiography or coronary ct angiography goldstandard anatomical tests for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease  the study was designed to provide additional independent validation of the corus cad test in a realworld intended use patient population of patients presenting for mpi a common noninvasive test for cad and builds on the results of the previous predict validation study corus cad requires only a simple blood draw for testing making it safe convenient and easy to administer the study evaluated results in stable nondiabetic patients with typical or atypical symptoms suggestive of cad and found that corus cad surpassed the accuracy of mpi a test that was administered more  million times in the us in  “the evaluation of stable patients with chest pain and other symptoms suggestive of cad is a common challenge for clinicians accounting for as many as  outpatient visits each day” said the publication’s lead author  gregory s thomas md mph medical director of the memorialcare heart  vascular institute at long beach memorial medical center and clinical professor of medicine and director of nuclear cardiology education at the  university of californiairvine  school of medicine “in the us mpi testing is often performed in these patients and is followed by referral to invasive coronary angiography based on the results of this study of the corus cad gene expression test we now have a reliable diagnostic approach for evaluating patients with symptoms of obstructive cad  with its high sensitivity and negative predictive value corus cad may help clinicians accurately and efficiently exclude the diagnosis of obstructive cad early in the diagnostic pathway so they can assess for other causes of their patients’ symptoms” the prespecified primary endpoint of the compass study was the receiveroperator characteristics roc analysis to evaluate the ability of corus cad to identify coronary arterial blockages of  percent or greater by quantitative coronary angiography  corus cad outperformed mpi in overall diagnostic accuracy for assessing obstructive cad with an area under the curve auc of  for the corus cad test compared to mpi site and corelab read aucs of  and  respectively p  in addition corus cad performed better than mpi in sensitivity  percent vs  percent p and negative predictive value  percent vs  percent p parameters thus demonstrating excellent performance for excluding obstructive cad as the cause of a patient’s symptoms  the compass results corroborated earlier findings from the predict multicenter us validation study demonstrating that the corus cad score is proportional to coronary artery stenosis severity “corus cad can help solve an enormous unmet need in healthcare by providing clinicians with a safe convenient and reliable tool to help evaluate common patient symptoms and triage them more appropriately for subsequent therapy or additional testing” said  david levison president and ceo of cardiodx  “in addition to its higher diagnostic accuracy corus cad holds potential to reduce a major healthcare expense category – unnecessary noninvasive imaging andor invasive coronary angiography procedures and their associated risks and side effects we have worked closely with leading clinicians to build a solid clinical and economic foundation for corus cad leading to its growing acceptance in the medical and payer communities as evidenced by the more than  tests performed to date and medicare’s decision to cover the test”  source httpwwwfiercemedicaldevicescompressreleasescardiodxannouncespublicationcompassstudydemonstratingcoruscadtesto by mark hollmer cardiodx is promoting yet another postmarketing study whose data may help the company’s gene expression test for obstructive coronary artery disease reach more patients better compete with the standard of care and also build vital market share executives at the californiabased  fierce  company say they wanted more data on corus cad‘s realworld use building on its previous predict validation trial as a result the test has been on sale commercially since  and won crucial medicare reimbursement last fall chief scientific officer steven rosenberg told fiercemedicaldevices via email that the results from the latest study pointed in a number of positive directions “it demonstrates performance at least as good as that seen in the predict study but in the population the corus cad is indicated for” rosenberg said “it shows significantly higher performance for obstructive cad than mpi which is the most common noninvasive imaging test used in this regard” a patient clinical study of the blood diagnostic rated the test with a  negative predictive value and  high sensitivity in assessing the condition in patients who were referred for stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging mpi last november cardiodx heralded similar results from another study using corus cad on  geriatric patients details are published in the journal circulation cardiovascular genetics the blood test conducted at  us sites through multiple academic institutions determined that using corus cad earlier in the diagnostic process better assessed the presence of coronary artery disease versus mpi this might encourage doctors to cut back on invasive more expensive cardiac tests by ruling out obstructive cad sooner in other words determining a patient doesn’t have obstructive cad eliminates the need for diagnostic procedures such as coronary angiography or coronary ct angiography the company explains postmarketing studies are increasingly important in today’s health care market with the need to demonstrate the utility of a device or diagnostic in as most detailed a way possible and it’s not just boosting the standard of care the affordable care act means value matters too more than ever before success with this mission can help broaden market share and also increase the chance of private as well as government insurance coverage additionally new postmarketing trials can also set the stage for expanded indications down the line source httpwwwfiercemedicaldevicescomstorycardiodxcaddxpassesanotherpostmarketingtestutmmediumnlutmsourceinternal a blood based gene expression test for

will be covered by medicare retroactive to jan  ron leuty reporter san francisco business times   a key national medicare contractor will cover the cost of a coronary artery disease test developed by cardiodx inc the move is important for palo altobased cardiodx because private insurers tend to follow the federal government’s medicare health insurance program the company has had to seek reimbursement on a casebycase basis with those private insurers since its corus cad gene expression test hit the market in june  the decision disclosed tuesday by palmetto gba a national contractor that administers medicare benefits in columbia sc means that medicare will cover the test for as many as  million enrollees coverage is retroactive to jan  corus cad is a shoeboxsize kit that uses a simple blood draw to measure the rna levels of  genes using an algorithm it then creates a score that determines the likelihood that a patient has obstructive coronary artery disease “by providing medicare beneficiaries access to corus cad this coverage decision enables patients to avoid unnecessary procedures and risks associated with cardiac imaging and elective invasive angiography while
