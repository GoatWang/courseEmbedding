south africa united kingdom united states close the blog   pm et  updated jun   izea the art of content marketing by richard finger the internet has spawned a universe of selfanointed experts pontificating on an array of topics as diverse as our universe itself the blogosphere has become a ubiquitous arm of the internet and social media as this horde of the content creators blog tweet and share photos and video on instagram flickr or youtube some create blogs simply as a passion and are satisfied with attendant psychic gratification as with any revolution change is rapid and iterative known by various names social sponsorships content marketing sponsored content is a way the ordinary content provider can monetize their content be it blogs video pictures or tweets the jargon is fluid and it may also be called marketing through the social media stream izea inc through their website has created the worlds largest network to match content providers and advertisers particular sponsors or advertisers often giant multinational corporations pay content providers to create target advertising for their products or services via a blog picture tweet or video an example might be a woman being paid to post an instagram picture of her in a particular brand of sunglasses or a blogger being paid by verizon to extol the virtues of their g wireless service performance keep in mind this is very distinct from display ads or banner advertising in the form of pictures and ad copy that appear on a website next to a blog article those promotions are mainly the purview of google adwords or google adsense i had a chance to talk with ceo and izea founder mr ted murphy about some of the recent developments at this rapidlygrowing company in january of this year in a cash and stock deal for  million izea purchased los angeles based ebyline this company matches their vetted proprietary database of freelance writers photographers and other content creators with businesses who are for example marketing products or expanding brand awareness it is complementary to the existing izea business model and now allows for them to do a fully managed concierge advertising campaign for example pepsi might now come to izea and like to buy  blog posts over the next six months now with an inhouse staff of writers izea can manage the content and efficiently control the placement of the articles on march  a press release announced izea has partnered with ad agency allisonpartners recently named prweeks  midsize agency of the year allisonpartners will adopt the izeax platform and bring their stable of clients to the izea catalog of content creators it should be a winwin for both outfits izea currently boasts a list of over  discrete registered content creators or influencers as they are socalled any influencer with desire to monetize their social media stream can simply sign up for free on the website izea can connect them with their over  registered advertisers and agencies including many of worlds top brand names audi volvo michelin unilever pepsi revlon kleenex kraft citibank and allstate what can a blogger or tweeter or instagramer expect to get paid by posting a picture blowing your nose with a kleenex tissue how long is a string celebrity kim kardashian with her millions of twitter followers may get paid many thousands for a single tweet a mommy blogger talking about the local pta may never be picked up by any advertisers how much is your influence or clout while the vast majority can expect less there are many izea influencers who make  or  monthly maybe they have  or  page views per month or maybe they have a smaller audience but write about a specific topic that targets an advertisers product for example perhaps a blogger writes explicitly about chainsaws and so a chainsaw manufacturer may be willing to pay significant dollars for that blogger to create content about their brand it is the proprietary izea algorithm that helps advertisers determine what an instagram photo of an attractive woman with a distinct brand of nail polish is worth full disclosure is made for all sponsored content per federal trade commission regulations the ftc guidelines are explicit when there exists a connection between the endorser and the seller of the advertised product which might materially affect the weight or credibility of the endorsement ie the connection is not reasonably expected by the audience such connection must be fully disclosed izea is in complete compliance with ftc rules izea is a publicly traded company it is listed on the over the counter market that is primarily reserved for microcap stocks it currently has a market capitalization of around  million and on an operating basis is not quite in a positive cash flow position there is no debt on the balance sheet but there might be another secondary stock offering to fund both operations and installment payments coming due on the ebyline purchase venture capitalbased companies are focused on scale or size rather than profitability if the company should become profitable in the near term different financing options will become available the  total revenues for izea were around  million and for  ceo murphy expressed optimism that internal growth combined with the ebyline acquisition that year  will generate  million in sales when i touched on the issue of profitability mr murphy expressed the following thoughts he quickly focused on the importance of achieving scale though they are by a large measure number one operator in the space he thinks it is critical to put so much more distance between izea and its competitors i think the plan is to become analogous to amazon  the pound gorilla therefore at this stage in the companys evolution there is no definitive metric to discern whether this company is either overvalued or undervalued currently a lot of money is being spent marketing to attract as many bloggers tweeters and instagramers to their platform significant funds are also funneled to engineering to perfect the already industry leading proprietary izeax platform agnostic software content providers can link social media accounts from any of the following networks google facebook twitter tumblr youtube instagram linkedin pinterest flickr you name it the connectivity is likely available ending  with  million in cash on their balance sheet and no long term debt the company is in a healthy financial position by financing growth with equity offerings rather than debt izea exhibits a conservative management style that suggests they are in for the long haul and will be able to weather any unforeseen exogenous economic events the market is exploding in size according to statista dollars spent on content marketing is expected to increase from  billion in  to  billion by  by capturing just a few percentage points of those numbers izea inc might just be a real winner follow richard finger on twitter
