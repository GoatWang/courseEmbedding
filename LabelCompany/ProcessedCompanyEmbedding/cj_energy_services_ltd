forwardlooking statements in part i of this quarterly report introductory note and corporate overview cj energy services ltd is a bermuda exempt company listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol cjes effective as of march   we completed the combination of cj energy services inc legacy cj with the completion and production services business the cp business of nabors industries ltd nabors pursuant to that certain agreement and plan of merger as amended the merger agreement dated as of june   by and among legacy cj nabors nabors red lion limited subsequently renamed cj energy services ltd new cj nabors cj merger co and cj holding co under the terms of the merger agreement nabors separated the cp business from the rest of its operations and consolidated this business under new cj a delaware subsidiary of new cj then merged with and into legacy cj with legacy cj continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of new cj such transactions referred to collectively as the merger effective upon closing of the merger the effective time shares of common stock of legacy cj were converted into common shares of new cj on a for basis new cj was renamed cj energy services ltd and its common shares began trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker cjes which was previously used by legacy cj following completion of our initial public offering in  after giving effect to the merger nabors owned approximately  of our outstanding common shares with legacy cj shareholders owning the remaining  of our outstanding common shares as of may   nabors owns approximately  of our outstanding common shares we are led primarily by the individuals who served as legacy cjs executive officers prior to the merger pursuant to rule ga under the exchange act following the closing of the merger new cj is the successor issuer to legacy cj and is deemed to succeed to legacy cjs reporting history under the exchange act because legacy cj was considered the accounting acquirer in the merger under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap legacy cj is also considered the accounting predecessor of cj energy services ltd  table of contents which is focused on strengthening expanding and diversifying our business through  the growth of our assets customer base and geographic reach both domestically and internationally for our core service lines and  strategic initiatives advancing service line diversification vertical integration and technological advancement over the last several years we have also significantly invested in our research and technology capabilities including the development of a stateoftheart research and technology center with a team of engineers and support staff we believe that one of the strategic benefits of this division is the ability to develop and implement new technologies and respond to changes in customer requirements and industry demand our efforts to date have been focused on developing innovative fitforpurpose solutions designed to enhance our core service offerings increase completion efficiencies provide cost savings to our operations and add value for our customers several of our research and technology initiatives are now generating monthly cost savings for our expanded integrated completion services operations which is central to our overall strategy of proactively managing our costs to maximize returns additionally several of these investments are delivering valueadded products and services that in addition to producing revenue are generating demand from key customers we believe these capabilities can provide a competitive advantage as customers look for innovative means for extracting oil and gas in the most economical and efficient way possible that said as with our other service lines and divisions we have been forced to implement meaningful cost reductions that negatively impact our research and technology initiatives including significantly scaling back or delaying certain projects recent developments temporary limited waiver under credit agreement we were not in compliance with the minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda covenant required to be tested as of march   under the amended credit agreement governing our credit facilities which is considered an event of default with respect to the credit agreement we have obtained a temporary limited waiver agreement from certain of the lenders in respect of this covenant violation effective from march   through may   wherein such lenders have agreed not to consider the covenant violation an event of default through may   we are actively negotiating with the  table of contents lenders to resolve this matter including with respect to alternatives to our current capital structure if this temporary limited waiver agreement is not extended the lenders holding more than  of the aggregate principal amount of the revolver and the fiveyear term loans may take certain actions including terminating the revolving commitments declaring the unpaid principal amount of the revolver and the five year term loans immediately due and payable requiring letters of credit to be cash collateralized and exercising other rights and remedies available under the amended credit agreement the lenders holding more than  of the aggregate principal amount of the sevenyear term loans could take similar actions with respect to the sevenyear term loans but only after the termination and acceleration of the revolver and fiveyear term loans while we are optimistic that ongoing negotiations with lenders will lead to satisfactory resolution of these issues we cannot provide any assurance that these negotiations will be successful and we are also exploring available financing and restructuring options if we are unable to find acceptable alternatives to our current capital structure or if we are unable to finance our operations on acceptable terms or at all our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected the foregoing description of the waiver agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full

so in due course operating segments our completion services segment consists of over  million hydraulic horsepower over  wireline units and over  coiled tubing units having significantly increased our asset base as a result of the merger however not all of these assets are utilized fully or at all at any given time due to among other things scheduled maintenance and downtime additionally in response to the continued deterioration in market conditions over the course of  and through the first quarter of  we implemented aggressive cost control measures and aligned our assets with industry demand which included stacking or idling unproductive equipment across our asset base within each service line  table of contents management evaluates our completion services segments operational performance and allocates resources primarily based on adjusted ebitda because it provides important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business within this segment adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure computed as total earnings loss before net interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization other income expense net net gain or loss on

and adjusted ebitda from our completion services segment for the first quarter of  were negatively impacted by lower overall utilization and pricing levels as we progressed through the first quarter we experienced a significant decline in activity and pricing across our service lines and operating areas as crude oil prices decreased and the drilling rig count continued to fall as utilization fell we strategically stacked additional equipment closed unprofitable facilities reduced head count and aggressively cut costs in order to further lower our operational cost structure specifically in our hydraulic fracturing division key customers in core basins delayed or canceled previously scheduled work and several of our largest competitors drove pricing below breakeven levels in order to protect or grow market share we continued to work with specific customers in core basins in order to maintain market share and position the company to maintain a strategic position for growth once the market begins to recover in most cases as utilization fell and margins declined we made the decision to stack an additional  of our working hydraulic horsepower in both our coiled tubing and wireline divisions we experienced decreases in utilization and aggressive price competition which forced us to continue rightsizing those businesses by stacking more equipment and further reducing head count in order to protect margin and limit reductions in profitability moving into the second quarter our completion services segment has continued to face significant challenges despite the fact that overall activity levels modestly improved entering april from the lows experienced during the first quarter as customers finalized their capital budgets after a substantial pullback in the first quarter due to falling oil prices however in our hydraulic fracturing business we continue to struggle to maintain utilization in the highly competitive environment with irrational unsustainable pricing there also continues to be an extreme lack of visibility with regard to nearterm market conditions but we believe that our cost cutting efforts have appropriately rightsized the business for the conditions expected in the second quarter our primary focus continues to be to meet the needs of our customers in the most cost efficient way possible which will best position the company for future growth in connection with any market recovery well support services our well support services segment which was acquired in the merger as part of the cp business consists of the following

company is working through an action plan to improve its performance matthew dilallo tmfmd nov   at pm what shares of cj energy services nysecjes were hit hard on thursday after it reported disappointing thirdquarter results the company missed analysts estimates reporting a widerthanexpected loss so what for the quarter cj energy services reported an adjusted loss of  million or  per share which was  per share more than the consensus estimate meanwhile revenue of  million was a few million dollars weaker than analysts were expecting the companys stumbles can be directly attributed to another extremely challenging quarter according to ceo josh comstock that was caused by the sustained weakness and volatility in oil prices in particular the companys completion service segment was weak after a decline in activity levels was coupled with increased pricing pressure furthermore its hydraulic fracturing services were deeply affected by two atypical events according to comstock first it aggressively reduced pricing with one of its most active customers to maintain that relationship resulting in weaker margins second it changed to an alternative lubricant to reduce costs but the product didnt perform to expectations this along with fluids that had metallurgical issues caused failures and damaged parts because of these issues it was no surprise to see comstock say that he was disappointed with the companys results it is worth noting however that cj energy services results contrasted starkly with those of its much larger peers especially halliburtons nysehal in fact halliburton president jeff miller said that he was pleased with the companys results this was after halliburton outperformed most of its peer group including its largest rival by delivering better revenue and margins on a sequential and yearoveryear basis furthermore because of its scale and diversification halliburton has been in a much better position to weather the downturn than a niche oilfield service company like cj energy services  now what clearly cj energy services has some work to do to resolve its issues it has already instituted a detailed action plan to enhance profitability and comstock noted that the initial results are positive that has him confident that the fourth quarter will show some financial improvements that said the company could continue to struggle in  if industry conditions dont improve matt dilallo has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends halliburton try any of our foolish newsletter
