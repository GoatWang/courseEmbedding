corp said it was concerned expanding into potash with a proposed development in canada would be a severe strategic misstep and risked being the next us shale a business it has urged bhp to spin off this sounds alarmingly familiar a spokesman for elliott said he said the recent appointment of relatively new board member ken mackenzie as the next chairman was an opportunity to set a new strategy and avoid repeating costly mistakes billions in shareholder value is at stake the spokesman said speaking at industry conference in barcelona in may bhp chief executive andrew mackenzie said management could seek board approval for the jansen potash project as early as next june with possible first production in  we will only develop when the time is right mr mackenzie told an audience of industry executives and investors adding the companys growth options would firstly focus on value a spokesman for the company declined to comment on elliotts latest attack elliott has been pushing for sweeping changes at bhp since last year and in april went public with its case that called for bhp to exit its us onshore oilandgas operations which were bought at the peak of the naturalgas boom and to collapse a dual ukaustralian structure in order to release billions of dollars in shareholder value and halt what it says has been a longstanding underperformance against rival rio tinto plc rio  and the broader equity market it refined its case in may urging bhp to launch an independent review of its global petroleum division and encouraged chairmanelect mackenzie to address capital

mackenzie that should focus on returns bhp has proposed developing jansen in several phases the first at a us billion incremental capital cost would have the capacity to product  million metric tons

limited bhp also known by the nickname the big australian was incorporated in  operating the silver and lead mine at broken hill in western new south wales australia the broken hill group floated on  august  the first consignment of broken hill ore  tons  cwt grs was smelted at the intercolonial smelting and refining companys works at spotswood melbourne the resulting  ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the city of melbourne bank in collins st some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else to ramp up the sharesanother shareholder the dominating wr wilson had had to lend william jamieson general manager a new suit so he could take the first prospectus printed at silverton near broken hill on  june  to adelaide to start the float process the geographic broken hill for which the town was named was discovered and named by charles sturt and created much interest among prospectors but nothing of note was discovered until charles rasp boundary rider for the encompassing mount gipps station pegged out a acre claim with contractors david james and james poole then with halfadozen backers the syndicate of seven including station manager george mcculloch a young cousin of victorian premier sir james mcculloch formed the broken hill company to stake out the whole hill in the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting several of the original seven parted with their shares and at the eve of the companys great success there were nine shareholders including rasp mcculloch william jamieson who bought up shares from several of the founders philip charley david james james poole bowes kelly and w r wilson john darling jr became a director of the company in  and was chairman of directors from  to  in  the company ventured into steel manufacturing with its operations based primarily in newcastle new south wales the decision to move from mining ore at broken hill to open a steelworks at newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the lowerlying sulphide ores the discovery of iron knob and iron monarch near the western shore of the spencer gulf in south australia combined with the development by the bhp metallurgist a d carmichael of a technique for separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock led bhp to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to  ft  m high the company began petroleum exploration in the s with

to step up us shale production by robb m stewart published july    pm et share by robbm stewart melbourne australiabhp billiton ltd bhpau said wednesday it plans to step up activity in the us oilandgas shale fields that activist shareholders are agitating for the resources company to offload the move is expected to revive flagging onshore production volumes even as bhp continues to invest in conventional energy operations and exploration in the gulf of mexico and other basins while seeking to sell some unwanted us shale acreage bhp has been forced to defend its strategy after new york hedge fund elliott management corp led a series of attacks in recent months calling for a sweeping overhaul of the worlds largestlisted mining company and criticizing the billions of dollars spent on acquisitions and mistimed share buybacks the push by elliott and other shareholders has drawn bhps petroleum division into the spotlight and revived questions about the billions of dollars spent picking on onshore us assets at the height of the naturalgas boom bhp on wednesday forecast a rise in overall production across its operations over the  financial year as steady growth in ironore output and a rebound in commodities including copper offset a further drop in petroleum volumes in the  months through june the company expects to have up  rigs operating in its us shale fields in the coming year double the number currently drilling for oil and gas after it added two more in the recent quarter chief executive andrew mackenzie said that will see it spending about us billion onshore us the bulk of its us billion petroleum expenditure budget for fiscal  which is expected to deliver a  increase in shale production the following year after an expected decline in the current period the company said after months of discussions with bhp and its directors elliott in april went public with its calls for the company to spin off its us petroleum business and to rid itself of its duallisted structure in favor of a main listing in london in may it refined its attack urging bhp to launch an independent review of all its oilandgas assets globally and to collapse its listed structure around the australian shares to unlock shareholder value and halt an underperformance in the shares a spokesman for elliott declined to comment wednesday on bhps quarterly production update or plans other investors have entered the fray including australian fund manager tribeca investment partners which has called for bhp to divest its us onshore oilandgas assets amp capital one of bhps largest shareholders has said bhp now needs to prove the worth of its us onshore business and why it is compatible with the broader portfolio bhp has rejected the criticism arguing that ending its ukaustralia structure would be too costly and that there was a beneficial fit between its mining and petroleum operations although mr mackenzie earlier this year conceded bhp had mistimed the shale acquisitions and had more recently pivoted its focus toward conventional assets in the production report mr mackenzie said the company was pushing ahead with an exit from noncore us acreage and a sale of the southern hawkville assets in texas was expected by september it also doesnt plan further development of its operations in the gasrich fayetteville in arkansas and is considering sale of these assets elsewhere in the portfolio mr mackenzie said drilling of the wildling appraisal well in the gulf of mexico will continue and results were expected this quarter while the recently approved second phase of the mad dog project in the deepwater gulf of mexico would expand oil volumes as supply tightens in the last financial year bhps petroleum production fell  to  million barrels of oil equivalent due to the deferral of activity onshore us and natural field decline in the conventional assets it forecast output would fall  in the year ahead production of iron ore the biggest driver of bhps earnings in the previous fiscal year rose  to  million metric tons in the justended fiscal year as prices rebounded with record volumes at bhps mines in western australia bhp said it expected output to grow by between  and  this year production of coking coal used alongside iron ore to producer steel fell  to  million tons in fiscal  in line with a target that was cut in april due to damage to the rail network caused by a cyclone in australias east coast bhp said production was expected to climb  this year thermal coal which is used by power stations was  higher at  million tons and is forecast to be steady to  higher this year and copper production is expected to jump by  this year after falling  in fiscal  to  million tonsthe lower end of revised guidance after output was

limited bhp also known by the nickname the big australian was incorporated in  operating the silver and lead mine at broken hill in western new south wales australia the broken hill group floated on  august  the first consignment of broken hill ore  tons  cwt grs was smelted at the intercolonial smelting and refining companys works at spotswood melbourne the resulting  ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the city of melbourne bank in collins st some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else to ramp up the sharesanother shareholder the dominating wr wilson had had to lend william jamieson general manager a new suit so he could take the first prospectus printed at silverton near broken hill on  june  to adelaide to start the float process the geographic broken hill for which the town was named was discovered and named by charles sturt and created much interest among prospectors but nothing of note was discovered until charles rasp boundary rider for the encompassing mount gipps station pegged out a acre claim with contractors david james and james poole then with halfadozen backers the syndicate of seven including station manager george mcculloch a young cousin of victorian premier sir james mcculloch formed the broken hill company to stake out the whole hill in the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting several of the original seven parted with their shares and at the eve of the companys great success there were nine shareholders including rasp mcculloch william jamieson who bought up shares from several of the founders philip charley david james james poole bowes kelly and w r wilson john darling jr became a director of the company in  and was chairman of directors from  to  in  the company ventured into steel manufacturing with its operations based primarily in newcastle new south wales the decision to move from mining ore at broken hill to open a steelworks at newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the lowerlying sulphide ores the discovery of iron knob and iron monarch near the western shore of the spencer gulf in south australia combined with the development by the bhp metallurgist a d carmichael of a technique for separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock led bhp to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to  ft  m high the company began petroleum exploration in the s with
