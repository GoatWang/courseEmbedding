national insurance company highlights as of  am best rating of a policyholder surplus  million total assets  million  harco annual statement faq contact usiat insurance group home faq faqs what is iat reinsurances underwriting model iat reinsurances genesis is rooted in the dual notions that  reinsurers should write premium when proper risk pricing is evident and  underwriters should be incented to restrain production when such evidence is absent underwriters and key staff in the business have direct and specific longterm exposure to the outcome of their risk decisions this is the keystone of iat reinsurances business strategy regardless of the program premium is not written unless the underwriter has personal financial risk attached to that decision where is the traditional reinsurance business written harco national given its am best a rating and broad licensing will originate and underwrite most of the traditional assumed reinsurance business some of this business may be retroceded to iat reinsurance company ltd under circumstances where the latters capital strength can relieve premium growth pressure business can also be written on iat reinsurance company ltd paper where clients may desire to have a more highly capitalized reinsurer with an am best rating of a under special circumstances we also have access to am best a rated paper why keep iat private iat reinsurances foundational business mandate is that of capital preservation protection of capital and surplus at the expense of growth in premium market share and earnings are paramount the luxury of adopting this policy is directly derived from its private company status a commensurate disinterest in courting capital market access and its shareholders indifference to public and industry visibility for its own sake iat reinsurance believes further that this business policy will engender amongst its clients and prospective clients a longterm and positive image of sustained capacity and financial strength while its market pricing requirements could make iat reinsurance less competitive in a soft market many clients will want and some will need to do business with firms whose capacity is certain in difficult markets where capital available for underwriting may otherwise contract directions contact usiat insurance group home directions directions our office is located in suite  of

omaha ne and acceptance casualty insurance company acic omaha ne the outlook of these ratings is stable the ratings are the result of these companies becoming members in a newly formed pool harco national groupharco group effective jan   the ratings of harco group reflect the group’s solid riskadjusted capitalization strategic initiatives focused on improving underwriting measures generally positive operating earnings and its niche market knowledge and expertise the members of the group write transportation related insurance products specialty insurance products and program business through general agents and retail independent agents as well as assumed reinsurance business produced through the brokered market the ratings also reflect the support of its parent company iat re through reinsurance agreements access to capital and management resources the ratings also recognize more recent aggressive initiatives to improve operating profitability through the hiring of new management internal management changes improved pricing execution tightening risk selection exiting lines such as crop public auto some segments of unprofitable trucking and homeowners programs as well as the expanded use of analytics and business intelligence partially offsetting these strengths are the group’s elevated common stock leverage as a percentage of surplus unfavorable underwriting results in  and  and the recent trend of modest adverse development in keeping with iat re’s strategy of capitalizing on equity market opportunities the group maintains high common stock leverage this exposes its policyholders’ surplus to fluctuating market values which resulted in significant net realized and unrealized capital losses in  in the years  substantial net realized and unrealized capital gains resulted in significant surplus increases with the increase in  being particularly strong concerns with fluctuating equity market values are somewhat mitigated by the investment expertise and financial support of iat re as evidenced by its historical capital contributions to offset substantial investment losses in its insurance subsidiaries although loss and loss adjustment expense reserves have historically been redundant there is modest adverse development being seen particularly for accident years   and  the group attributes this to a restructuring of the claims department as well as adverse development on the runoff of the public auto line factors that could lead to positive rating actions include the group achieving and sustaining solid underwriting and overall operating performance relative to the performance of the commercial casualty composite and a strong level of riskadjusted capitalization the ratings of the group may come under negative pressure if operating performance or riskadjusted capitalization falls markedly short of am best expectations there is a material deviation from the company’s submitted financial projections there is an increase in loss reserve variability or the reporting of adverse loss reserve development or if its parent company iat re fails to provide necessary financial and operational support the rating affirmations of iat re acknowledge its supportive level of riskadjusted capitalization solid liquidity and generally positive operating returns the company continues to generate net investment income and generally favorable capital gains which partially offset underwriting losses during the latest five year period as its profitability is driven by the business it assumes from its subsidiaries in its role as their primary reinsurer this press release relates to credit ratings that have been published on am best’s website for all rating information relating to the release and pertinent
