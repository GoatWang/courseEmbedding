management company utilizes a multiple counselor system in which each portfolio manager independently manages a portion of each fund or institutional client account portfolio managers use only their highest conviction stock selections in their respective portfolios diversification is achieved through the aggregation of each portfolio managers investment positions since portfolio managers choose only their highest conviction ideas for their portfolios sector allocation often differs substantially from that of the sp  primecap management company believes that this will provide a superior return over the long term but in any given year its results can differ materially from the returns of the sp  portfolio managers also provide leadership in the research effort for particular stocks and industry groups in this regard the firms portfolio managers perform in an industry group specialist role similar to that of its financial analysts to the extent that an individual portfolio manager or financial analyst convinces others of the merits of a particular investment idea the firms weighting in that idea may become significant due to the collective ownership by multiple portfolio managers historically this crosspollination of ideas has led to a fairly concentrated portfolio the top ten positions typically represent more than  percent of the assets in each fund or institutional client account although primecap management company places a strong emphasis on individual decisionmaking its investment professionals do not work in isolation portfolio managers and financial analysts benefit from a high degree of interaction including daily meetings in which they discuss portfoliorelated news and information observations from recent research trips and investment ideas in addition the firm conducts weekly research meetings during which industry updates and investment ideas can be presented and discussed each investment professional is a member of the investment team which maintains an action list in which all companies owned in the portfolio are rated buy hold or sell individual portfolio managers or financial analysts may propose a change or
