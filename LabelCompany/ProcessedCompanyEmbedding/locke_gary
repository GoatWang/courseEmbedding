us commerce secretary locke will shortly be replaced by former sen max baucus d mont chinafile an online magazine published by asia society’s center on uschina relations hosts a feature called conversations — smart takes on breaking china news by some of the most respected and thoughtful observers of china both inside and outside the country in this chinafile conversation participants discuss the editorial the perils of racial perception and locke’s legacy as ambassador  kaiser kuo director of international communications for the chinese web services company baidu banana or twinkie for whiteontheinside east asian–americans oreo for africanamericans coconut for south asian–americans apple for native americans — these epithets are all products of the simplistic groundless belief that one’s race should correspond to a rarely defined set of behavioral norms to a locus of identity and loyalty as an ethnic chinese born and raised in the united states i heard the term banana a lot sometimes directed my way sometimes in reference to another american of east asian extraction who wasn’t chinese or japanese or korean or vietnamese enough these were also terms i frequently heard and still occasionally hear east asian–americans call themselves often with pride rather than selfdeprecation whether it’s insulting depends on the context and who’s on the receiving end in the context of this regrettable editorial which was as subtle as a barking doberman banana was meant with unmistakable malice — that locke is a race traitor who lacks the political loyalty to the chinese nation that his blood should somehow confer this is of course naive nonsense and the patent ridiculousness of that phrase should have been obvious even to a writer totally unfamiliar with the complexities of the us discourse on race but while many chinese will object to the editorial’s broadsides against locke and many already have i suspect they will focus much more on another part of the essay the irony that state media would call out locke for living well but projecting everyman simplicity the expectation that anyone with a chinese phenotype will have a chinese heart to match even multiple generations removed is widespread in chinese society the plasticity of identity in multiethnic societies — that what you owe the race or the old country as say an american is entirely up to you — is still a fairly alien concept for most chinese we see this at work in the way chinese law enforcement treats naturalized chinese with us canadian or australian citizenship in locke’s case you’d think that the fact that he was in beijing as the top representative of the us government would dispel any expectation that his loyalties and identity should be to anywhere but washington the state or dc yet i would wager that even among his ardent admirers in china — the people who responded most positively to his backpacktoting starbucksbuying downtoearth style — part of that admiration grew out of a sense that he was one of us a chinese person locke reinforced this deliberately or otherwise with each visit to his ancestral home in taishan guangdong it was certainly useful to play to and it often worked in any case to have expected colorblindness toward locke in china would be even more naive than to have expected it in the united states with president barack obama americans are certainly not immune to the kind of thinking that gives rise to race traitor accusations it’s often there in the subtext when expatriates attack mark rowswell the white canadian with impeccable spoken chinese who has for many years played the character dashan on chinese television it’s implicit alongside more reasonable objections in criticism of white reporters who go on air for cctv news and it’s there in the derision many feel for those who call themselves eggs — white people who’ve convinced themselves that they’re really culturally asian with a yolk consisting their detractors might say of an obsessive familiarity with manga or anime martial arts films eastern religion traditional chinese medicine and of course yellow fever that creepy fetishistic attraction to east asian women sure the globe and mail or the new york times are not flinging race traitor but it would hardly surprise me were subtler accusations of race treason to pop up on fox hyeonju rho us public interest lawyer calling an asianamerican person a banana means of course that he is yellow on the outside but white at the core the banana critique suggests something interesting about the chinese reaction to locke initially many thought he might be easier to deal with than his predecessors because he was one of us disappointment set in when — surprise surprise — locke stood firm in representing us interests ironically one of the challenges asianamericans face in the united states is the sense that we are not american enough one of the country’s great shames was the mass incarceration of us citizens of japanese descent during world war ii while in more recent decades asianamericans have continued to face the suspicion that they are somehow not fully american in  men who blamed him for autoworker jobs lost to japanese competition murdered vincent chin an immigrant of chinese descent in detroit in  wen ho lee a naturalized us citizen from taiwan who had lived in the united states for more than  years was wrongfully accused of stealing secrets for china despite these injustices the american ability to welcome and be shaped by the talents of immigrants from around the globe has always been one of its greatest strengths that locke a us citizen of chinese descent could become governor of washington a secretary of commerce and a us ambassador is a testament to this the outdated notion of ethnicity reflected in the china news service banana comment is part of a nationalist strand in the people’s republic of china’s polity that hopefully is a minority view and if being a banana means that ambassador locke is american to the core i suspect that he might not mind the insult too much sidney rittenberg founder and president of the china consulting team rittenberg associates wang ping’s scurrilous and infantile personal attack on locke — well known for his personal integrity — visits new global shame on china’s stateowned media wang’s title farewell gary locke is an attempt to gain traction by the use of a famous essay by mao zedong on the departure from china of us ambassador john leighton stuart in the runup to the founding of the people’s republic of china this cheap publicity trick however only adds to the shame because of the contrast between the two essays  mao’s essay of which i was one of the translators carefully avoids any disrespect for stuart instead going out of its way to cite stuart’s record as a japanese prisoner in world war ii wang launches a personal attack on ambassador locke using the political language of the chinese gutter  mao wrote his essay during a bitter civil war in which the united states was providing major military financial and political support to his enemy chiang kaishek his scathing critique of washington’s policy came naturally under the circumstances the stateowned tightly controlled china news service on the other hand published this filth at a time when leaders of both china and the united states have openly declared their commitment to forging a new type of relationship between these two great powers how then are foreign readers to view this attack on locke if the defense argument should be that china news service does not censor comment that would cause knowledgeable observers to as the chinese saying goes laugh their teeth out but any other defense would reveal a disturbing ambiguity in china’s policy toward the united states i am far from happy with us foreign policy including its china policy but that’s not the point here the point is how do we explain a chinese media that indulges in such disreputable attacks and in the hate campaign against all japanese when the state it represents is supposed to believe in internationalism not in ultranationalism andrew j nathan class of  professor of political science at columbia university to be sure the editorial is scurrilous racist and incoherent — it claims bafflingly that when locke left the the skies suddenly became blue but its main concern seems to be with locke’s effective projection of us soft power this is a battlefront that increasingly obsesses the chinese leaders as seen in their denunciations of universal values and the enumeration of seven themes that cannot be discussed including constitutionalism civil society freedom of speech and independent media to the leaders these themes are not matters of intellectual debate they are positions on a political battlefield where the ruling communist party is in a weak position because of the widespread popularity of these ideas in china and the obvious inability of the chinese regime to fulfill them just as beijing sees the current events in ukraine as yet another color revolution cynically engineered by the west to expand its strategic footprint so too locke carrying his bags is seen as a political act aimed at humiliating the chinese leadership and weakening its hold on power if a white ambassador had played these games they could have been seen as just another set of funny foreign customs sending an ethnic chinese to conduct this kind of propaganda action must seem to show a special deviousness on the part of the schemers in washington chen weihua columnist and chief washington correspondent for china daily and deputy editor of china daily usa to me the huge attention triggered by the article about locke’s departure carried on the china news service website is both warranted and unwarranted first the unjustified part the story though on china news service’s website looks highly unlikely to be the work of its staff let alone its editorial board it looks more likely the creation of an unsophisticated blogger or freelancer the language used is simply too coarse a departure from the standards and style of the china news service i have observed over the years second western media tends to interpret any article on chinese news media as the view of the organization but that is often not true for example many believe my weekly newspaper column represents the views of the paper or even the chinese government that is totally untrue it is always my personal view in this sense there is no need to make a big fuss of such an article an ordinary one likely by a blogger there are literally hundreds if not millions of different views on every single issue in china these days especially when you follow social media personally i disagree with a lot of what the article said i would also give locke credit if he was the one who started the pm readings airquality readings of particulate matter less then  micrometers in diameter my column last week was about how china’s ministry of environmental protection should become more powerful and accountable in the face of such severe smog shrouding much of china pm readings allow more chinese to recognize the severity and urgency of china’s environmental and health challenges dramatically cutting the visa time for chinese tourists as locke has done benefits both countries it has enabled more chinese to visit the united states to open their eyes at the same time this has proved to be a smart policy for the united states because of the huge purchasing power of chinese visitors  given that he’s an american with chinese ancestry and the us ambassador to china there is no doubt that locke represents the united states not china or chinese many chinese do not understand that the united states is a nation of immigrants if everyone pledged loyalty to their ancestral hometown there would be no united states shen dingli professor and associate dean at fudan university’s institute of international studies in a globalizing world everyone should have the tolerance to recognize the dual identities of others as both national citizens and as global villagers although ambassador locke must be concerned with all other countries including china the country of his ancestors his allegiance is first and foremost to his own country this has nothing to do with his race or the color of either his skin or his core it is hard to understand slandering a nonchinese for failing to promote chinese interests just because his ancestors were chinese in fact ambassador locke acted in conformity with the trend that china is attempting to practice he traveled coach class to beijing in compliance with state department rules that us officials even at the rank of ambassador have to fly economy class if the flight time is fewer than  hours unless the passenger has an official appointment upon arrival ambassador locke’s flight was half an hour shy of  hours and he didn’t have an official engagement on arrival so he didn’t qualify to fly a more comfortable class i am pleased to see that my country is now exerting tougher control over its own officials’ travel and accommodation locke did indeed enjoy a coffee at starbucks but it is odd to conceive of this as a deliberate show to make himself seem more down to earth he probably does the same kinds of things all the time in private even if his common touch were a deliberate performance one ought to exercise civility in tolerating it these days many people who do the same are commended for it it’s true that locke has addressed human rights issues frequently despite china’s progress but china has done the same with regard to other countries chairman mao supported martin luther king’s civil movement for equal rights china supported nelson mandela’s antiapartheid actions and it still publishes the us human rights reports as long as the united states does so first fundamentally china and the united states should engage in dialogue in such areas to truly implement a new type of majorcountry relationship rather than looking at onesided stories about each other having said this i am critical of locke for illegally bringing rights lawyer chen guangcheng into the us embassy in beijing a clear breach of chinese law but the chinese government still allowed chen to leave the country showing its attachment to the importance of bilateral relations given the intense complexity of chinaus relations rather than issuing such questionable comments it would be prudent to bid farewell to ambassador locke with openness and balance correction max baucus was a senator from montana an earlier version of the story incorrectly said that he was a senator from minnesota share  twitter

beijing post in  to rejoin his family in seattle the first us ambassador to china of chinese descent locke’s lowkey unassuming attitude charmed the chinese populace  dec   in his final days as us ambassador to china gary locke made one last visit to relatives at his familys ancestral village in taishan in southern china william wanthe washington post buy photo wait  second to continue by simon denyer by simon denyer november   follow simondenyer beijing — us ambassador to china gary locke who won plaudits for his lowkey style and for cutting visa waiting times for chinese citizens entering the united states announced wednesday that he will step down early next year to rejoin his family in seattle locke the first chinese american to hold the beijing post might be best remembered in china for a photograph taken even before he arrived in  that shows him with his young daughter at the seattle airport wearing a backpack and trying to pay for coffee with a coupon the image circulated widely on social media with many chinese concluding that locke who was also seen flying economy class was much more downtoearth and less reliant on publicly funded luxuries than their own officials the biggest tests locke faced as ambassador came in  in february a highprofile police chief in the southwestern city of chongqing sought refuge in a us consulate two months later a blind human rights activist escaped from house arrest and sought sanctuary at the us embassy in beijing locke’s greatest achievement may have been cutting waiting times for us visas to three to five days down from  to  days when he took over locke said the improvement had “significantly increased chinese business and travel tourism to the us” douglas paal vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington said locke should be applauded for the visa progress at the same time he said it was “not evident” that the ambassador had a grand strategic vision for the uschina relationship gary locke nominated to be next us ambassador to china talks to post editor lillian cunningham about the leadership imperative for uschinese relations the washington post locke suffered somewhat for his chinese heritage something that did not necessarily boost his authority with officials here paal said “that plays well in the united states but doesn’t translate in the host environment they don’t treat you as an equal in china” the first major diplomatic standoff during locke’s tenure involved police chief wang lijun who gave the us consulate in chengdu near chongqing information about the murder of british businessman neil heywood unleashing one of china’s biggest political scandals in decades the case eventually led to the life imprisonment of chongqing’s leader bo xilai on corruption charges in april just days before thensecretary of state hillary rodham clinton arrived in china for an important bilateral dialogue the blind legal activist chen guangcheng was given shelter in the us embassy in beijing for six days locke was on vacation at the time but he hurried back to china to manage the crisis again he won praise for a photograph — this time showing him holding chen’s hand as the two entered a hospital the activist was later allowed to leave china with his family and settle in the united states sun zhe a professor in the department of international relations at tsinghua university in beijing said locke had helped stabilize uschina ties and handled the  situations well by communicating with the governments in washington and beijing roundtheclock “it is not an easy job to be the american ambassador to china” sun said “gary locke is not a shining star but a simple and unadorned ambassador” locke a former commerce secretary and governor of washington state also focused on promoting us exports to china and on chinese investment in the united states which he said had helped create american jobs but experts said he had never seemed to hold much sway with the obama administration in a statement announcing his departure locke said he had also “advanced american values by meeting with religious leaders and human rights lawyers and visiting tibetan and uighur ethnic minorities in tibet and xinjiang” embassy officials said locke decided to leave his post to reunite with his family and ensure that his children could finish their schooling in one place rather than over concerns about pollution or schooling in china “mrs locke and the locke children moved back to the seattle area last summer so that the two eldest children could complete their high school education there” spokesman nolan barkhouse said shen dingli executive dean of the institute of international studies at fudan university in shanghai praised locke for promoting trade and peopletopeople ties adding that he “showed us how a us ministerlevel official behaves by taking economyclass flights” but he said locke had “caused a twist” in uschina relations when a subordinate allowed activist chen to take shelter in the embassy in his absence despite that controversy china’s foreign ministry said it appreciated the “positive efforts” locke had made in promoting bilateral cooperation including helping arrange a meeting between president xi jinping and president obama at the sunnylands estate in california in june that meeting said spokesman hong lei “established the direction of building a new type of relationship between great powers” liu liu contributed to this report related the five craziest moments from gary locke’s tenure as us ambassador to china world
