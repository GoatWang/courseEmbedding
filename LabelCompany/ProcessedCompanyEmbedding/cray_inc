in minneapolis the companys first product the cray supercomputer was a major success because it was significantly faster than all other computers at the time the first system was sold within a month for us million seymour cray continued working this time on the cray though it only ended up being marginally faster than the cray xmp developed by another team at the company cray soon left the ceo position to become an independent contractor he started a new vlsi technology lab for the cray in boulder colorado cray laboratories in  which closed in  undaunted cray later headed a similar spinoff in  cray computer corporation ccc in colorado springs where he worked on the cray project—the first attempt at major use of gallium arsenide gaas semiconductors in computing however the changing political climate collapse of the warsaw pact and the end of the cold war resulted in poor sales prospects ultimately only one cray was delivered and a number of followon designs were never completed the company filed for bankruptcy in  cccs remains then began crays final corporation src computers inc which still exists cray research continued development along a separate line of computers originally with lead designer steve chen and the cray xmp after chens departure the cray ymp cray c and cray t were developed on the original cray architecture but achieved much greater performance via multiple additional processors faster clocks and wider vector pipes the uncertainty of the cray project gave rise to a number of crayobjectcode compatible crayette firms scientific computer systems scs american supercomputer supertek and perhaps one other firm these firms did not mean to compete against cray and therefore attempted less expensive slower cmos versions of the xmp with the release of the cos operating system scs and the cft fortran compiler they also considered national labs lanlllnl developed ctss operating system as well before caving in to the tide of unixes cray te processor board a series of massively parallel computers from thinking machines kendall square research intel supercomputing systems division ncube maspar and meiko scientific took over the s high performance market at first cray research denigrated such approaches by complaining that developing software to effectively use the machines was difficult – a true complaint in the era of the illiac iv but becoming less so each day cray eventually realized that the approach was likely the only way forward and started a fiveyear project to capture the lead in this area the plans result was the dec alphabased cray td and cray te series which left cray as the only remaining supercomputer vendor in the market besides nec by  most sites with a cray installation were considered a member of the exclusive club of cray operators cray computers were considered quite prestigious because crays were extremely expensive machines and the number of units sold was small compared to ordinary mainframes this perception extended to countries as well to boost the perception of exclusivity cray researchs marketing department had promotional neckties made with a mosaic of tiny national flags illustrating the club of crayoperating countriescomputer history museum cray  th anniversary recorded presentation  new vendors introduced small supercomputers known as minisupercomputers as opposed to superminis during the late s and early s which outcompeted lowend cray machines in the market the convex computer series as well as a number of smallscale parallel machines from companies like pyramid technology and alliant computer systems were particularly popular one such vendor was supertek whose s machine was an aircooled cmos implementation of the xmp processor cray purchased supertek in  and sold the s as the cray xms but the machine proved problematic meanwhile their notyetcompleted s a ymp clone was later offered as the cray ymp el later becoming the el series which started to sell in reasonable numbers in —to mostly smaller companies notably in the oil exploration business this line evolved into the cray j and eventually the cray sv in  in december  cray purchased some of the assets of floating point systems another minisuper vendor that had moved into the file server market with its sparcbased model  line these smp machines scaled up to  processors and ran a modified version of sun microsystems solaris cray set up cray research superservers inc later the business systems division to sell this system as the cray smp later replacing it with the cray cs in spite of these machines being some of the most powerful available when applied to appropriate workloads cray was never very successful in this market possibly due to it being so foreign to their existing market niche ccc was building the craysss when it went into chapter  in march  silicon graphics  to edit cray research merged with silicon graphics sgi in february  at the time the industry was highly critical of the move noting that there was little overlap between the two companies either in markets or technology founder seymour cray died as a result of a traffic accident later that year sgi immediately sold off the superservers business to sun who quickly turned the ultrasparcbased starfire project then under development into the extremely successful enterprise  range of servers sgi did use a number of cray technologies in their attempt to move from the graphics workstation market into supercomputing key among these was the use of the craydeveloped hippi databus and details of the interconnects used in the t series sgis longterm strategy was to merge their highend server line with crays product lines in two phases codenamed sn and sn sn standing for scalable node the sn was intended to replace the te and sgi origin  systems and later became the snmips or sgi origin  architecture the sn was originally intended to unify all highendsupercomputer product lines including the t into a single architecture this goal was never achieved before sgi divested itself of the cray business and the sn name was later associated with the snia or sgi altix  architecture under sgi ownership one new cray model line the sv was launched in  this was a clustered smp vector processor architecture developed from j technology sgi set up a separate cray research business unit in august  in preparation for detachment on march   the unit was sold to tera computer company tera computer company was then renamed cray inc when the deal closed on april  cray inc  to presentedit craydesigned hlrniii konrad at zuse institute berlin  after the tera merger the tera mta system was relaunched as the cray mta this was not a commercial success and shipped to only two customers cray inc also unsuccessfully badged the nec sx supercomputer as the cray sx and acquired exclusive rights to sell the sx in the us canada and mexico in  cray inc announced their first new model the cray x combined architecture vector  mpp supercomputer previously known as the sv the x is the end result of the earlier sn concept originated during the sgi years in may  cray was announced to be one of the partners in the us department of energys fastestcomputerintheworld project to build a  teraflops machine for the oak ridge national laboratory cray was sued in  by isothermal systems research for patent infringement the suit claimed that cray used isrs patented technology in the development of the cray x the lawsuit was settled in  as of november  the cray x had a maximum measured performance of  teraflops being the th fastest supercomputer in the world since then the x has been superseded by the xe with faster dualcore processors on october   the company announced the cray xd range of entrylevel supercomputers which use dualcore bit amd opteron cpus running linux this system was previously known as the octigabay k before crays acquisition of that company the xd provided one xilinx virtex ii pro fieldprogrammable gate array fpga with each node of four opteron processors the fpgas could be configured to embody various digital hardware designs and could augment the processing or inputoutput capabilities of the opteron processors furthermore each fpga contains a pair of powerpc  processors which can add to the already considerable power of a single node the cray xd although moderately successful was eventually discontinued in  cray completed the red storm system for sandia national laboratories red storm was to become the jumpingoff point for a string of successful products that eventually revitalized cray in supercomputing red storm had processors clustered in  unit cabinets a theoretical maximum of  cabinets in a machine and a design speed of  teraflops red storm also included an innovative new design for network interconnects which was dubbed seastar and destined to be the centerpiece of succeeding innovations by cray the cray xt massively parallel supercomputer became a commercialized version of red storm similar in many respects to the earlier te architecture but like the xd using amd opteron processors the cray xt introduced in  added support for ddr memory newer dualcore and future quadcore opteron processors and utilized a second generation seastar communication coprocessor it also included an option for fpga chips to be plugged directly into processor sockets unlike the cray xd which required a dedicated socket for the fpga coprocessor on august   peter ungaro was appointed ceo ungaro had joined cray in august  as vice president of sales and marketing and had been made crays president in march  on november   cray announced a new system the cray xmt based on the mta series of machines this system combined multithreaded processors as used on the original tera systems and the seastar interconnect used by the xt by reusing asics boards cabinets and system software used by the comparatively higher volume xt product the cost of making the very specialized mta system can be reduced a second generation of the xmt is scheduled for release in  with the first system ordered by the swiss national supercomputing center cscs in  cray announced a vision of products dubbed adaptive supercomputing the first generation of such systems dubbed the rainier project used a common interconnect network seastar programming environment cabinet design and io subsystem these systems included the existing xt and the xmt the second generation launched as the xth allowed a system to combine compute elements of various types into a common system sharing infrastructure the xth combined opteron vector multithreaded and fpga compute processors in a single system in april  cray and intel announced they would collaborate on future supercomputer systems this partnership produced the cray cx system launched in september the same year this was a deskside blade server system comprising up to  dual or quadcore intel xeon processors with either microsoft windows hpc server  or red hat enterprise linux installed in early  cray also introduced the cray cx a rackmounted system with a choice of computebased gpubased or smpbased chassis the cx and cx product lines were sold until late  by  the largest computer system cray had delivered was the xt system at national center for computational sciences at oak ridge national laboratories this system with over  processing cores was dubbed jaguar and was the fastest computer in the world as measured by the linpack benchmark at the speed of  petaflops until being surpassed by the tianhea in october  it was the first system to exceed a sustained performance of  petaflops on a bit scientific application in may  the cray xe supercomputer was announced the cray xe system had at its core the new gemini system interconnect this new interconnect included a true globaladdress space represented a return to the te feature set that had been so successful with cray research this product was a successful followon the xtxt and xt products the first multicabinet xe system was shipped in july  the next generation cascade systems were designed make use of future multicore andor manycore processors from vendors such as intel and nvidia cascade was scheduled to be introduced in early  and designed to use the nextgeneration network chip and followon to gemini code named aries in  cray announced the cray xk hybrid supercomputer the cray xk system capable of scaling to  processors and  petaflops of peak performance combines crays gemini interconnect amds multicore scalar processors and nvidias tesla gpgpu processors in october  cray announced the cray xk which supports the nvidia kepler gpgpu and announced that the ornl jaguar system would be upgraded to an xk renamed titan and capable of over  petaflops titan was the worlds fastest supercomputer as measured by the linpack benchmark until the introduction of the tianhe in  which is substantially faster in  cray also announced it had been awarded the m us blue waters contract with the university of illinois after ibm had pulled out of the delivery this system was delivered in  and was the largest system to date in terms of cabinets and generalpurpose x processors that cray had ever delivered in november  the cray sonexion  data storage system was introduced and signaled cray entry into the high performance storage business this product used modular technology and a lustre file system in april  cray inc announced the sale of its interconnect hardware development program and related intellectual property to intel corporation for  million on november   cray announced the acquisition of appro international inc a californiabased privately held developer of advanced scalable supercomputing solutions currently the  provider on the top supercomputer list appro builds some of the worlds most advanced high performance computing hpc cluster systems on november   cray announced the acquisition of the

from year to year cray manufactures its products in chippewa falls wisconsin where its founder seymour cray was born and raised the company also has offices in st paul minnesota the site of its original headquarters under seymour cray and numerous other sales service engineering and rd locations around the world the companys predecessor cray research inc cri was founded in  by computer designer seymour cray seymour cray went on to form the spinoff cray computer corporation ccc in  which went bankrupt in  while cray research was bought by sgi the next year cray inc was formed in

when he joined engineering research associates era in saint paul minnesota there he helped to create the era  era eventually became part of univac and began to be phased out he left the company in  a few years after former era employees set up control data corporation cdc he initially worked out of the cdc headquarters in minneapolis but grew upset by constant interruptions by managers he eventually set up a lab at his home town in chippewa falls wisconsin about  miles to the east cray had a string of successes at cdc including the cdc  and cdc  cray research inc and cray computer corporation  to edit cray supercomputer when cdc ran into financial difficulties in the late s development funds for his followon cdc  became scarce when he was told the project would have to be put on hold in  cray left to form his own company cray research inc copying the previous arrangement cray kept the research and development facilities in chippewa falls and put the business headquarters in minneapolis the companys first product the cray supercomputer was a major success because it was significantly faster than all other computers at the time the first system was sold within a month for us million seymour cray continued working this time on the cray though it only ended up being marginally faster than the cray xmp developed by another team at the company cray soon left the ceo position to become an independent contractor he started a new vlsi technology lab for the cray in boulder colorado cray laboratories in  which closed in  undaunted cray later headed a similar spinoff in  cray computer corporation ccc in colorado springs where he worked on the cray project—the first attempt at major use of gallium arsenide gaas semiconductors in computing however the changing political climate collapse of the warsaw pact and the end of the cold war resulted in poor sales prospects ultimately only one cray was delivered and a number of followon designs were never completed the company filed for bankruptcy in  cccs remains then began crays final corporation src computers inc which still exists cray research continued development along a separate line of computers originally with lead designer steve chen and the cray xmp after chens departure the cray ymp cray c and cray t were developed on the original cray architecture but achieved much greater performance via multiple additional processors faster clocks and wider vector pipes the uncertainty of the cray project gave rise to a number of crayobjectcode compatible crayette firms scientific computer systems scs american supercomputer supertek and perhaps one other firm these firms did not mean to compete against cray and therefore attempted less expensive slower cmos versions of the xmp with the release of the cos operating system scs and the cft fortran compiler they also considered national labs lanlllnl developed ctss operating system as well before caving in to the tide of unixes cray te processor board a series of massively parallel computers from thinking machines kendall square research intel supercomputing systems division ncube maspar and meiko scientific took over the s high performance market at first cray research denigrated such approaches by complaining that developing software to effectively use the machines was difficult – a true complaint in the era of the illiac iv but becoming less so each day cray eventually realized that the approach was likely the only way forward and started a fiveyear project to capture the lead in this area the plans result was the dec

overlap between the two companies either in markets or technology founder seymour cray died as a result of a traffic accident later that year sgi immediately sold off the superservers business to sun who quickly turned the ultrasparcbased starfire project then under development into the extremely successful enterprise  range of servers sgi did use a number of cray technologies in their attempt to move from the graphics workstation market into supercomputing key among these was the use of the craydeveloped hippi databus and details of the interconnects used in the t series sgis longterm strategy was to merge their highend server line with crays product lines in two phases codenamed sn and sn sn standing for scalable node the sn was intended to replace the te and sgi origin  systems and later became the snmips or sgi origin  architecture the sn was originally intended to unify all highendsupercomputer product lines including the t into a single architecture this goal was never achieved before sgi divested itself of the cray business and the sn name was later associated with the snia or sgi altix  architecture under sgi ownership one new cray model line the sv was launched in  this was a clustered smp vector processor architecture developed from j technology sgi set up a separate cray research business unit in august  in preparation for detachment on march   the unit was sold to tera computer company tera computer company was then renamed cray inc when the deal closed on april  cray inc  to presentedit craydesigned hlrniii konrad at zuse institute berlin  after the tera merger the tera mta system was relaunched as the cray mta this was not a commercial success and shipped to only two customers cray inc also unsuccessfully badged the nec sx supercomputer as the cray sx and acquired exclusive rights to sell the sx in the us canada and mexico in  cray inc announced their first new model the cray x combined architecture vector  mpp supercomputer previously known as the sv the x is the end result of the earlier sn concept originated during the sgi years in may  cray was announced to be one of the partners in the us department of energys fastestcomputerintheworld project to build a  teraflops machine for the oak ridge national laboratory cray was sued in  by isothermal systems research for patent infringement the suit claimed that cray used isrs patented technology in the development of the cray x the lawsuit was settled in  as of november  the cray x had a maximum measured performance of  teraflops being the th fastest supercomputer in the world since then the x has been superseded by the xe with faster dualcore processors on october   the company announced the cray xd range of entrylevel supercomputers which use dualcore bit amd opteron cpus running linux this system was previously known as the octigabay k before crays acquisition of that company the xd provided one xilinx virtex ii pro fieldprogrammable gate array fpga with each node of four opteron processors the fpgas could be configured to embody various digital hardware designs and could augment the processing or inputoutput capabilities of the opteron processors furthermore each fpga contains a pair of powerpc  processors which can add to the already considerable power of a single node the cray xd although moderately successful was eventually discontinued in  cray completed the red storm system for sandia national laboratories red storm was to become the jumpingoff point for a string of successful products that eventually revitalized cray in supercomputing red storm had processors clustered in  unit cabinets a theoretical maximum of  cabinets in a machine and a design speed of  teraflops red storm also included an innovative new design for network interconnects which was dubbed seastar and destined to be the centerpiece of succeeding innovations by cray the cray xt massively parallel supercomputer became a commercialized version of red storm similar in many respects to the earlier te architecture but like the xd using amd opteron processors the cray xt introduced in  added support for ddr memory newer dualcore and future quadcore opteron processors and utilized a second generation seastar communication coprocessor it also included an option for fpga chips to be plugged directly into processor sockets unlike the cray xd which required a dedicated socket for the fpga coprocessor on august   peter ungaro was appointed ceo ungaro had joined cray in august  as vice president of sales and marketing and had been made crays president in march  on november   cray announced a new system the cray xmt based on the mta series of machines this system combined multithreaded processors as used on the original tera systems and the seastar interconnect used by the xt by reusing asics boards cabinets and system software used by the comparatively higher volume xt product the cost of making the very specialized mta system can be reduced a second generation of the xmt is scheduled for release in  with the first system ordered by the swiss national supercomputing center cscs in  cray announced a vision of products dubbed adaptive supercomputing the first generation of such systems dubbed the rainier project used a common interconnect network seastar programming environment cabinet design and io subsystem these systems included the existing xt and the xmt the second generation launched as the xth allowed a system to combine compute elements of various types into a common system sharing infrastructure the xth combined opteron vector multithreaded and fpga compute processors in a single system in april  cray and intel announced they would collaborate on future supercomputer systems this partnership produced the cray cx system launched in september the same year this was a deskside blade server system comprising up to  dual or quadcore intel xeon processors with either microsoft windows hpc server  or red hat enterprise linux installed in early  cray also introduced the cray cx a rackmounted system with a choice of computebased gpubased or smpbased chassis the cx and cx product lines were sold until late  by  the largest computer system cray had delivered was the xt system at national center for computational sciences at oak ridge national laboratories this system with over  processing cores was dubbed jaguar and was the fastest computer in the world as measured by the linpack benchmark at the speed of  petaflops until being surpassed by the tianhea in october  it was the first system to exceed a sustained performance of  petaflops on a bit scientific application in may  the cray xe supercomputer was announced the cray xe system had at its core the new gemini system interconnect this new interconnect included a true globaladdress space represented a return to the te feature set that had been so successful with cray research this product was a successful followon the xtxt and xt products the first multicabinet xe system was shipped in july  the next generation cascade systems were designed make use of future multicore andor manycore processors from vendors such as intel and nvidia cascade was scheduled to be introduced in early  and designed to use the nextgeneration network chip and followon to gemini code named aries in  cray announced the cray xk hybrid supercomputer the cray xk system capable of scaling to  processors and  petaflops of peak performance combines crays gemini interconnect amds multicore scalar processors and nvidias tesla gpgpu processors in october  cray announced the cray xk which supports the nvidia kepler gpgpu and announced that the ornl jaguar system would be upgraded to an xk renamed titan and capable of over  petaflops titan was the worlds fastest supercomputer as measured by the linpack benchmark until the introduction of the tianhe in  which is substantially faster in  cray also announced it had been awarded the m us blue waters contract with the university of illinois after ibm had pulled out of the delivery this system was delivered in  and was the largest system to date in terms of cabinets and generalpurpose x processors that cray had ever delivered in november  the cray sonexion  data storage system was introduced and signaled cray entry into the high performance storage business this product used modular technology and a lustre file system in april  cray inc announced the sale of its interconnect hardware development program and related intellectual property to intel corporation for  million on november   cray announced the acquisition of appro international inc a californiabased privately held developer of advanced scalable supercomputing solutions currently the  provider on the top supercomputer list appro builds some of the worlds most advanced high performance computing hpc cluster systems on november   cray announced the acquisition of the

relaunched as the cray mta this was not a commercial success and shipped to only two customers cray inc also unsuccessfully badged the nec sx supercomputer as the cray sx and acquired exclusive rights to sell the sx in the us canada and mexico in  cray inc announced their first new model the cray x combined architecture vector  mpp supercomputer previously known as the sv the x is the end result of the earlier sn concept originated during the sgi years in may  cray was announced to be one of the partners in the us department of energys fastestcomputerintheworld project to build a  teraflops machine for the oak ridge national laboratory cray was sued in  by isothermal systems research for patent infringement the suit claimed that cray used isrs patented technology in the development of the cray x the lawsuit was settled in  as of november  the cray x had a maximum measured performance of  teraflops being the th fastest supercomputer in the world since then the x has been superseded by the xe with faster dualcore processors on october   the company announced the cray xd range of entrylevel supercomputers which use dualcore bit amd opteron cpus running linux this system was previously known as the octigabay k before crays acquisition of that company the xd provided one xilinx virtex ii pro fieldprogrammable gate array fpga with each node of four opteron processors the fpgas could be configured to embody various digital hardware designs and could augment the processing or inputoutput capabilities of the opteron processors furthermore each fpga contains a pair of powerpc  processors which can add to the already considerable power of a single node the cray xd although moderately successful was eventually discontinued in  cray completed the red storm system for sandia national laboratories red storm was to become the jumpingoff point for a string of successful products that eventually revitalized cray in supercomputing red storm had processors clustered in  unit cabinets a theoretical maximum of  cabinets in a machine and a design speed of  teraflops red storm also included an innovative new design for network interconnects which was dubbed seastar and destined to be the centerpiece of succeeding innovations by cray the cray xt massively parallel supercomputer became a commercialized version of red storm similar in many respects to the earlier te architecture but like the xd using amd opteron processors the cray xt introduced in  added support for ddr memory newer dualcore and future quadcore opteron processors and utilized a second generation seastar communication coprocessor it also included an option for fpga chips to be plugged directly into processor sockets unlike the cray xd which required a dedicated socket for the fpga coprocessor on august   peter ungaro was appointed ceo ungaro had joined cray in august  as vice president of sales and marketing and had been made crays president in march  on november   cray announced a new system the cray xmt based on the mta series of machines this system combined multithreaded processors as used on the original tera systems and the seastar interconnect used by the xt by reusing asics boards cabinets and system software used by the comparatively higher volume xt product the cost of making the very specialized mta system can be reduced a second generation of the xmt is scheduled for release in  with the first system ordered by the swiss national supercomputing center cscs in  cray announced a vision of products dubbed adaptive supercomputing the first generation of such systems dubbed the rainier project used a common interconnect network seastar programming environment cabinet design and io subsystem these systems included the existing xt and the xmt the second generation launched as the xth allowed a system to combine compute elements of various types into a common system sharing infrastructure the xth combined opteron vector multithreaded and fpga compute processors in a single system in april  cray and intel announced they would collaborate on future supercomputer systems this partnership produced the cray cx system launched in september the same year this was a deskside blade server system comprising up to  dual or quadcore intel xeon processors with either microsoft windows hpc server  or red hat enterprise linux installed in early  cray also introduced the cray cx a rackmounted system with a choice of computebased gpubased or smpbased chassis the cx and cx product lines were sold until late  by  the largest computer system cray had delivered was the xt system at national center for computational sciences at oak ridge national laboratories this system with over  processing cores was dubbed jaguar and was the fastest computer in the world as measured by the linpack benchmark at the speed of  petaflops until being surpassed by the tianhea in october  it was the first system to exceed a sustained performance of  petaflops on a bit scientific application in may  the cray xe supercomputer was announced the cray xe system had at its core the new gemini system interconnect this new interconnect included a true globaladdress space represented a return to the te feature set that had been so successful with cray research this product was a successful followon the xtxt and xt products the first multicabinet xe system was shipped in july  the next generation cascade systems were designed make use of future multicore andor manycore processors from vendors such as intel and nvidia cascade was scheduled to be introduced in early  and designed to use the nextgeneration network chip and followon to gemini code named aries in  cray announced the cray xk hybrid supercomputer the cray xk system capable of scaling to  processors and  petaflops of peak performance combines crays gemini interconnect amds multicore scalar processors and nvidias tesla gpgpu processors in october  cray announced the cray xk which supports the nvidia kepler gpgpu and announced that the ornl jaguar system would be upgraded to an xk renamed titan and capable of over  petaflops titan was the worlds fastest supercomputer as measured by the linpack benchmark until the introduction of the tianhe in  which is substantially faster in  cray also announced it had been awarded the m us blue waters contract with the university of illinois after ibm had pulled out of the delivery this system was delivered in  and was the largest system to date in terms of cabinets and generalpurpose x processors that cray had ever delivered in november  the cray sonexion  data storage system was introduced and signaled cray entry into the high performance storage business this product used modular technology and a lustre file system in april  cray inc announced the sale of its interconnect hardware development program and related intellectual property to intel corporation for  million on november   cray announced the acquisition of appro international inc a californiabased privately held developer of advanced scalable supercomputing solutions currently the  provider on the top supercomputer list appro builds some of the worlds most advanced high

washington it also manufactures systems for data storage and analytics several cray supercomputer systems are listed in the top which ranks the most powerful supercomputers in the world the number of cray systems on the list varies from year to year cray manufactures its products in chippewa falls wisconsin where its founder seymour cray was born and raised the company also has offices in st paul minnesota the site of its original headquarters under seymour cray and numerous other sales service engineering and rd locations around the world the companys predecessor cray research inc cri was founded in  by computer designer seymour cray seymour cray went on to form the spinoff cray computer corporation ccc in  which went bankrupt in  while cray research was bought by sgi the next year cray inc was formed in  when tera computer company purchased the cray research inc business from sgi and adopted the name of its acquisition contents  company history  background  to   cray research inc and cray computer corporation  to   silicon graphics  to   cray inc  to present  references  further reading  external links company historyedit background  to edit seymour cray began working in the computing field in  when he joined engineering research associates era in saint paul minnesota there he helped to create the era  era eventually became part of univac and began to be phased out he left the company in  a few years after former era employees set up control data corporation cdc he initially worked out of the cdc headquarters in minneapolis but grew upset by constant interruptions by managers he eventually set up a lab at his home town in chippewa falls wisconsin about  miles to the east cray had a string of successes at cdc including the cdc  and cdc  cray research inc and cray computer corporation  to edit cray supercomputer when cdc ran into financial difficulties in the late s development funds for his followon cdc  became scarce when he was told the project would have to be put on hold in  cray left to form his own company cray research inc copying the previous arrangement cray kept the research and development facilities in chippewa falls and put the business headquarters in minneapolis the companys first product the cray supercomputer was a major success because it was significantly faster than all other computers at the time the first system was sold within a month for us million seymour cray continued working this time on the cray though it only ended up being marginally faster than the cray xmp developed by another team at the company cray soon left the ceo position to become an independent contractor he started a new vlsi technology lab for the cray in boulder colorado cray laboratories in  which closed in  undaunted cray later headed a similar spinoff in  cray computer corporation ccc in colorado springs where he worked on the cray project—the first attempt at major use of gallium arsenide gaas semiconductors in computing however the changing political climate collapse of the warsaw pact and the end of the cold war resulted in poor sales prospects ultimately only one cray was delivered and a number of followon designs were never completed the company filed for bankruptcy in  cccs remains then began crays final corporation src computers inc which still exists cray research continued development along a separate line of computers originally with lead designer steve chen and the cray xmp after chens departure the cray ymp cray c and cray t were developed on the original cray architecture but achieved much greater performance via multiple additional processors faster clocks and wider vector pipes the uncertainty of the cray project gave rise to a number of crayobjectcode compatible crayette firms scientific computer systems scs american supercomputer supertek and perhaps one other firm these firms did not mean to compete against cray and therefore attempted less expensive slower cmos versions of the xmp with the release of the cos operating system scs and the cft fortran compiler they also considered national labs lanlllnl developed ctss operating system as well before caving in to the tide of unixes cray te processor board a series of massively parallel computers from thinking machines kendall square research intel supercomputing systems division ncube maspar and meiko scientific took over the s high performance market at first cray research denigrated such approaches by complaining that developing software to effectively use the machines was difficult – a true complaint in the era of the illiac iv but becoming less so each day cray eventually realized that the approach was likely the only way forward and started a fiveyear project to capture the lead in this area the plans result was the dec alphabased cray td and cray te series which left cray as the only remaining supercomputer vendor in the market besides nec by  most sites with a cray installation were considered a member of the exclusive club of cray operators cray computers were considered quite prestigious because crays were extremely expensive machines and the number of units sold was small compared to ordinary mainframes this perception extended to countries as well to boost the perception of exclusivity cray researchs marketing department had promotional neckties made with a mosaic of tiny national flags illustrating the club of crayoperating countriescomputer history museum cray  th anniversary recorded presentation  new vendors introduced small supercomputers known as minisupercomputers as opposed to superminis during the late s and early s which outcompeted lowend cray machines in the market the convex computer series as well as a number of smallscale parallel machines from companies like pyramid technology and alliant computer systems were particularly popular one such vendor was supertek whose s machine was an aircooled cmos implementation of the xmp processor cray purchased supertek in  and sold the s as the cray xms but the machine proved problematic meanwhile their notyetcompleted s a ymp clone was later offered as the cray ymp el later becoming the el series which started to sell in reasonable numbers in —to mostly smaller companies notably in the oil exploration business this line evolved into the cray j and eventually the cray sv in  in december  cray purchased some of the assets of floating point systems another minisuper vendor that had moved into the file server market with its sparcbased model  line these smp machines scaled up to  processors and ran a modified version of sun microsystems solaris cray set up cray research superservers inc later the business systems division to sell this system as the cray smp later replacing it with the cray cs in spite of these machines being some of the most powerful available when applied to appropriate workloads cray was never very successful in this market possibly due to it being so foreign to their existing market niche ccc was building the craysss when it went into chapter  in march  silicon graphics  to edit cray research merged with silicon graphics sgi in february  at the time the industry was highly critical of the move noting that there was little overlap between the two companies either in markets or technology founder seymour cray died as a result of a traffic accident later that year sgi immediately sold off the superservers business to sun who quickly turned the ultrasparcbased starfire project then under development into the extremely successful enterprise  range of servers sgi did use a number of cray technologies in their attempt to move from the graphics workstation market into supercomputing key among these was the use of the craydeveloped hippi databus and details of the interconnects used in the t series sgis longterm strategy was to merge their highend server line with crays product lines in two phases codenamed sn and sn sn standing for scalable node the sn was intended to replace the te and sgi origin  systems and later became the snmips or sgi origin  architecture the sn was originally intended to unify all highendsupercomputer product lines including the t into a single architecture this goal was never achieved before sgi divested itself of the cray business and the sn name was later associated with the snia or sgi altix  architecture under sgi ownership one new cray model line the sv was launched in  this was a clustered smp vector processor architecture developed from j technology sgi set up a separate cray research business unit in august  in preparation for detachment on march   the unit was sold to tera computer company tera computer company was then renamed cray inc when the deal closed on april  cray inc  to presentedit craydesigned hlrniii konrad at zuse institute berlin  after the tera merger the tera mta system was relaunched as the cray mta this was not a commercial success and shipped to only two customers cray

laboratories this system with over  processing cores was dubbed jaguar and was the fastest computer in the world as measured by the linpack benchmark at the speed of  petaflops until being surpassed by the tianhea in october  it was the first system to exceed a sustained performance of  petaflops on a bit scientific application in may  the cray xe supercomputer was announced the cray xe system had at its core the new gemini system interconnect this new interconnect included a true globaladdress space represented a return to the te feature set that had been so successful with cray research this product was a successful followon the xtxt and xt products the first multicabinet xe system was shipped in july  the next generation cascade systems were designed make use of future multicore andor manycore processors from vendors such as intel and nvidia cascade was scheduled to be introduced in early  and designed to use the nextgeneration network chip and followon to gemini code named aries in  cray announced the cray xk hybrid supercomputer the cray xk system capable of scaling to  processors and  petaflops of peak performance combines crays gemini interconnect amds multicore scalar processors and nvidias tesla gpgpu processors in october  cray announced the cray xk which supports the nvidia kepler gpgpu and announced that the ornl jaguar system would be upgraded to an xk renamed titan and capable of over  petaflops titan was the worlds fastest supercomputer as measured by the linpack benchmark until the introduction of the tianhe in  which is substantially faster in  cray also announced it had been awarded the m us blue waters contract with the university of illinois after ibm had pulled out of the delivery this system was delivered in  and was the largest system to date in terms of cabinets and generalpurpose x processors that cray had ever delivered in november  the cray sonexion  data storage system was introduced and signaled cray entry into the high performance storage business this product used modular technology and a lustre file system in april  cray inc announced the sale of its interconnect hardware development program and related intellectual property to intel corporation for  million on november   cray announced the acquisition of appro international inc a californiabased privately held developer of advanced scalable supercomputing solutions currently the  provider on the top supercomputer list appro builds some of the worlds most advanced high performance computing hpc cluster systems on november   cray announced

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
