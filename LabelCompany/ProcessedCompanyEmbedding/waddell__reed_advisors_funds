rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve

breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income

investment style for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  years unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers the adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees including but not limited to distribution and service b fees and reimburse certain expenses there is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time day sec yield is calculated based on a formula mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec that calculates a funds hypothetical annualized income as a percentage of its assets a securitys income for the purposes of this calculation is based on the current market yield to maturity in the case of bonds or projected dividend yield for stocks of the funds holdings over a trailing  day period this hypothetical income will differ at times significantly from the funds actual experience as a result income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the sec yield month trailing distribution yield at nav refers to the month historical cash flow paid over the past  months in dividends divided by the past months ending nav alpha beta rsquared standard deviation sharpe ratio and capture ratio are  year statistics alpha is a measure of a funds actual returns and expected performance given its level of risk as measured by beta beta reflects the sensitivity of the funds return to fluctuations in the market index rsquared indicates how much of a funds fluctuations were attributable to movements in the funds benchmark standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a funds returns are sharpe ratio is a measure of a funds riskadjusted performance capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return upside capture or negative return downside capture the morningstar rating™ for funds or star rating is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance and does not include the effects of sales charges the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear

reed advisors international growth fund  market sector update equities continued to perform well during the quarter despite a number of negative risk events in europe – the cypriot financial crisis inconclusive election results in italy and countries reporting slowing economic data despite these hardships central banks remained very accommodative and provided support for equity prices in japan new leadership implemented monetary easing policies in an effort to get the country out of its longterm economic slump fueled by these efforts the yen weakened significantly and japanese equity markets rallied in the quarter both the us stock market and us dollar experienced a strong rally during the first quarter of  driven primarily by market stability and growth consequently the strengthening us dollar led to a selloff in emerging markets as liquidity flew back to the us market in asia investors were disappointed by weakerthanexpected economic data from china and india economic recovery in china continued albeit at a slower pace than expected meanwhile the coalition government in india appears to be fracturing resulting in the market downturn as muchneeded government reforms were pushed farther into the future portfolio strategy the fund underperformed the benchmark for the period stock selection was the primary deterrent to performance where holdings in industrials information technology and consumer discretionary were the largest relative detractors while sector allocation was better an underweight in the wellperforming consumer discretionary sector as well as an allocation to cash was a drag on performance while the fund had increased its japanese equity weighting and properly hedged part of its yen exposure the fund had not done enough of either japanese stocks surged on the dramatic shift in policy and benefited greatly from the weakening yen the fund was simply too tentative to properly take advantage aggressive monetary easing policies implemented in japan adversely affected holdings in china and india as well the weakening of the japanese yen resulted in increased money flows to japan as investors chased stock performance consequently interest in china and india waned unfavorably affecting stock performance in those regions the fund’s underweight position and strong stock selection within the materials sector added to performance outlook it is difficult to know if the market is comfortable with massive and growing government debt loads such as in japan the us and europe given that officials have proven they will continually attempt to sustain markets through aggressive monetary and fiscal policy assuming the latest japanese experiment continues successfully that market should remain strong in yen terms anecdotally the low yields and promise of a weakening currency are currently leading flows into higheryielding markets this likely includes a variety of emerging and also somewhat troubled bond markets – likely brazil and indonesia but also possibly spain and portugal the distortion of rates especially in the us and japan has led to a global search for yield we believe this is supportive for equities as many stocks provide reasonable yields and will likely provide protection from eventual inflation the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the funds manager and are current

advisors increasingly are combining both active and passive investment management styles when building client portfolios these new products allow us to pair a highly experienced index fund manager with our skilled inhouse ivy investment management team whose focus of course is on active management” said thomas w butch executive vice president of waddell  reed financial inc and ceo of ivy distributors inc “we chose these five categories precisely because they complement our active product lineup and they are differentiated styles outside of what we believe are more commoditized passive asset classes commonly available elsewhere” he added “for example the sp  bond index fund tracking bonds of the index’s companies will be the first index mutual fund with this strategy to this point” index funds typically are a costeffective way for investors to track a benchmark index meaning returns to index funds over time generally should mirror returns of their tracking index minus any fund expenses the divergence between the net returns of an index fund and its tracking index is referred to as “tracking error” iico and proshares intend to monitor continually the performance and tracking error of the proposed ivy proshares index funds to seek to ensure investors expectations are properly addressed according to ivy executives share class and expense information will be available as the
