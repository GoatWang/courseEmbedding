lead the ceo of gap took a yearolds complaint from idea to major change in just  weeks feedback like this is a gift its great to see one ceo who knew what to do with it by justin bariso justin bariso is an author and a consultant who helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact in  linkedin named him the “top voice” in “management and culture” his forthcoming book eq applied shares fascinating research modern examples and personal stories that illustrate how emotional intelligence works in the real world justinjbariso founder insightjustinjbariso write a comment credit getty images a couple of weeks ago a young girl named alice jacob wrote a letter to fashion retailer gap asking for the store to consider more variety in the clothes it offers to girls instead of just pink and princesses and stuff like that as a father to an awesome yearold daughter who happens to love dinosaurs i completely get this request well the president and ceo of gap jeff kirwan just responded and his email is remarkable as reported by the washington post hi alice i got hold of the letters you sent in and wanted to be the one to reply to you im jeff and im the head of gap you sound like a really cool kid with a great sense of style at gapkids we try to always offer a wide range of styles and choices for girls and boys this includes a selection of girls tees with dinosaurs firetrucks sharks footballs and some of our superheroes our latest disney collection beauty and the beast is also all about the strength and bravery of girls and thats something thats really important to us but you are right i think we can do a better job offering even more choices that appeal to everyone ive talked with our designers and were going to work on even more fun stuff that i think youll like in the meantime im going to send you a few of my favorite tees from our latest collection please check them out and let us know what you think our customers comments are very important to us and they help us create even better products with each season thank you againjeff gap brand president  ceo wow now thats what i call customer service there are a few things that make kirwans message so great and that leaders everywhere can learn from for example identifying that customer complaints are a giftbecause they offer valuable feedback and the opportunity to improve sending free stuff in exchange for that valuable feedback which makes a huge impression and will probably win that customer for life praising and acknowledging the opposing party which most people cant do nowadays all of these things are great but theres one action here that stands head and shoulders above the rest he took advice from a yearold thats right a ceo of a multibillion dollar company with over  employees actually acknowledged that a yearold had identified a major problem not a fellow executive not mckinsey or bcg a yearold thats not an easy thing for most people to do it should be though because so often you can get the best feedback from the person youd least expect to offer it like that new intern or even the janitor so if you take only one thing away from kirwans letter may it be
