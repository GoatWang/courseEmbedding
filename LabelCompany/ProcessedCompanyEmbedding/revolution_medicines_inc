revolution product engine a revolutionary approach in drug discovery our innovative product engine draws inspiration from nature and evolution which can be a source of insights into cancer targets disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches  we pay particular attention to natural products that are inherently rich with biological function as a result of natural selection and can inform and guide our discovery and development of small molecules that can modulate such targets our use of biologically relevant chemical information from nature depends on our ability to synthesize and modify complex natural products specific portions of these complex compounds and entirely original molecules inspired by natural products our revblocks™ platform builds upon the research of the company’s academic founder martin d burke md phd who invented a transformative method for synthesizing chemical compounds including complex natural products analogs or original small molecules that are pharmaceutically optimized revblocks is a rapid standardized and powerful process for conducting advanced medicinal chemistry by assembling simple “chemical building blocks” into refined structures that have significant potential as bestinclass drug candidates revolution medicines is thus able to synthesize modify and improve many complex compounds that would be very challenging or even impossible to modify without this approach we practice this technology under an exclusive license agreement with the university of illinois in addition to our modular synthesis technology revolution medicines deploys its reveal™ platform to help guide design of compounds reveal is a knowledgedriven informatics system designed to recognize advantageous structural and functional properties of scaffolds that can be exploited to engage protein targets by learning from natures experience in this way we can elevate certain preferred compounds or portions of compouds as chemical starting points for optimization as drug candidates that will engage and modulate important disease targets this computational platform also supports the process of optimization of lead compounds product engine

veterinary technician should demonstrate or instruct the pet owner regarding the appropriate technique for applying revolution topically to dogs and cats prior to first use firmly press the cap down to puncture the seal on the revolution tube a clicking sound will confirm that the cap has successfully punctured the seal remove the cap and check to ensure that the tip of the tube is open to administer the product part the hair on the back of the animal at the base of the neck in front of the shoulder blades until the skin is visible place the tip of the tube on the skin and squeeze the tube  or  times to empty its entire contents directly onto the skin in one spot keeping the tube squeezed drag it away from the liquid and lift to remove check the tube to ensure that it is empty do not massage the product into the skin due to alcohol content do not apply to broken skin avoid contact between the product and fingers do not apply when the haircoat is wet bathing or shampooing the dog  or more hours after treatment will not reduce the effectiveness of revolution against fleas or heartworm bathing or shampooing the cat  hours after treatment will not reduce the effectiveness of revolution against fleas bathing or shampooing the cat  hours after treatment will not reduce the effectiveness of revolution against heartworm stiff hair clumping of hair hair discoloration or a slight powdery residue may be observed at the treatment site in some animals these effects are temporary and do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the product discard empty tubes in your ordinary household refuse flea control in dogs and cats for the prevention and control of flea infestations revolution should be administered at monthly intervals throughout the flea season starting one month before fleas become active in controlled laboratory studies  of fleas were killed within  hours results of clinical field studies using revolution monthly demonstrated  control of flea infestations within  days of the first dose dogs and cats treated with revolution including those with preexisting flea allergy dermatitis showed improvement in clinical signs associated with fleas as a direct result of eliminating the fleas from the animals and their environment if the dog or cat is already infested with fleas when the first dose of revolution is administered adult fleas on the animal are killed and no viable fleas hatch from eggs after the first administration however an environmental infestation of fleas may persist for a short time after beginning treatment with revolution because of the emergence of adult fleas from pupae heartworm prevention in dogs and cats for the prevention of heartworm disease revolution must be administered on a monthly basis revolution may be administered yearround or at least within one month after the animal’s first exposure to mosquitoes and monthly thereafter until the end of the mosquito season the final dose must be given within one month after the last exposure to mosquitoes if a dose is missed and a monthly interval between dosing is exceeded then immediate administration of revolution and resumption of monthly dosing will minimize the opportunity for the development of adult heartworms when replacing another heartworm preventive product in a heartworm disease prevention program the first dose of revolution must be given within a month of the last dose of the former medication selamectin the active ingredient in revolution is a macrocyclic lactone compound these compounds effectively prevent the development of adult heartworms when administered to dogs and cats within one month of exposure to infective l dirofilaria immitis larvae efficacy of macrocyclic lactones decreases below  in dogs however if first administered  months after exposure to infective larvae thus in heartworm endemic regions delaying initiation of heartworm prevention using revolution beyond  months of first exposure to infective larvae eg starting puppies and kittens at  weeks of age or gaps of  months in the administration of revolution during periods of heartworm transmission increases the risk of the animal acquiring heartworms animals with unknown heartworm history that test negative for heartworms prior to the initiation of revolution may be harboring prepatent infections at the time revolution was started testing such animals  months after initiation of revolution would be necessary to confirm their negative heartworm status at the discretion of the veterinarian cats ≥ months of age may be tested to determine the presence of existing heartworm infections before beginning treatment with revolution cats already infected with adult heartworms can be given revolution monthly to prevent further infections ear mite treatment in dogs and cats for the treatment of ear mite o cynotis infestations in dogs and cats revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose a second monthly dose may be required in some dogs monthly use of revolution will control any subsequent ear mite infestations in the clinical field trials ears were not cleaned and many animals still had debris in their ears after the second dose cleansing of the infested ears is recommended to remove the debris sarcoptic mange treatment in dogs for the treatment of sarcoptic mange s scabiei in dogs revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose a second monthly dose may be required in some dogs monthly use of revolution will control any subsequent sarcoptic mange mite infestations because of the difficulty in finding sarcoptic mange mites on skin scrapings effectiveness assessments also were based on resolution of clinical signs resolution of the pruritus associated with the mite infestations was observed in approximately  of the dogs  days after the first treatment and in approximately  of the dogs  days after the second monthly treatment tick control in dogs for the control of tick dermacentor variabilis infestations in dogs revolution should be administered on a monthly basis in heavy tick infestations complete efficacy may not be achieved after the first dose in these cases one additional dose may be administered two weeks after the previous dose with monthly dosing continued thereafter nematode treatment in cats for the treatment and control of intestinal hookworm a tubaeforme and roundworm t cati infections revolution should be applied once as a single topical dose safety revolution has been tested safe in over  different pure

million series a financing to discover and develop new therapies derived from natural products revolution medicines’ innovative approach reconfigures these complex chemicals of life into bestinclass medicines veteran industry leader mark a goldsmith md phd is the founding president and chief executive officer of revolution medicines dr goldsmith brings to the company more than  years of experience as an academic scientist and senior executive in the biotechnology industry and is a partner at third rock ventures revolution medicines builds upon the vision of the company’s founder and scientific advisory board chairman martin d burke md phd professor of chemistry university of illinois at urbanachampaign and early career scientist of the howard hughes medical institute dr burke invented a transformative method for synthesizing original compounds that are pharmaceutically optimized analogues of complex natural products the company has entered into an exclusive license agreement with the university of illinois to practice and expand this technology and is pursuing a rapid clinical development path with its lead antifungal program that originated in dr burke’s laboratory “with this major advance in chemical synthesis we now have the opportunity to unlock the full medical benefits of natural products that have been selected through a billion years of evolutionary pressure” said dr goldsmith “marty is a remarkably inventive chemical biologist and revolution medicines is working closely with him in his role as scientific advisory board chairman to exploit his breakthroughs for industrialscale drug discovery through redesigning complex molecules our strategy should produce highimpact treatments for serious infections and noninfectious diseases among them our lead product candidates for patients with lifethreatening fungal infections” the arduous process of synthesizing natural products often requires years of trial and error to reconstruct a single chemical scaffold in contrast revolution medicines’ approach is a rapid standardized and powerful process for assembling simple “chemical building blocks” into refined natural productlike structures these optimized compounds have significant potential as bestinclass drug candidates revolution medicines’ first drug candidates exploit and improve upon the properties of amphotericin b a powerful broadspectrum antifungal compound found in nature that has avoided generating significant drug resistance in  years of clinical use full therapeutic benefit from this highly efficacious natural compound is significantly compromised by inherent doselimiting side effects principally kidney damage using the building block synthesis platform to create new molecules dr burke and his research group overturned decades of scientific dogma and demonstrated that the antifungal efficacy of the amphotericin b scaffold can be separated chemically from the major mechanism that underlies human kidney cell damage revolution medicines is developing novel compounds that leverage the proven therapeutic mechanism for killing fungi while minimizing toxic effects on human cells “professor burke and his group have demonstrated the power of research at our school to uncover methods and drug candidates that can be enormously impactful on human health” said phyllis wise phd chancellor of the university of illinois at urbanachampaign “as one of the nation’s original landgrant institutions our mission at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign is to serve the public good through learning discovery and outreach third rock ventures has launched revolution medicines to translate these discoveries into important human benefits” revolution medicines team the revolution medicines

remarkable effects on specific proteins many of these compounds were developed as defenses by microbes and their actions are highly instructive more broadly understanding how they interact with cellular targets can reveal valuable insights into the biology underlying the targets and how such targets can be engaged by small molecules furthermore these natural products themselves can reveal chemical insights that can inform the drug discovery process hence we exploit these insights from nature’s lessons to understand frontier cancer targets and to inspire drug discovery approaches that can master them to take greatest advantage of evolution’s lessons our drug discovery toolkit is inspired by the complex chemical space favored by nature including natural products or fragments of natural products that bind to large flat ligand binding sites and proteinprotein interactions that are typical of many frontier targets and can represent significant hurdles to drug discovery we exploit this unique toolkit to give us the greatest opportunity to succeed our drug discovery approach is enabled by breakthrough modular synthesis technology revblocks ™ that allows us to craft optimal drug candidates that bind to these nonclassical target binding sites   revolution about us a revolutionary approach in drug discovery revolution medicines discovers and develops new drugs that harness the therapeutic potential of frontier oncology targets on behalf of cancer patients our innovative product engine draws inspiration from nature and evolution which offer insights into cancer targets disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches we pay particular attention to natural products that are inherently rich with biological function as a result of natural selection and can inform and guide our discovery and development of small molecules that can modulate these targets revolution medicines exploits inventions by the company’s lead founder martin d burke md phd professor of chemistry university of illinois at urbanachampaign who developed a transformative method for synthesizing chemical compounds including complex natural products analogs or original small molecules that are pharmaceutically optimized revolution medicines has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with the university of illinois to practice this technology revolution medicines’ integrated product engine builds upon and expands these modular synthesis methods to power the focused and efficient assembly of simple chemical building blocks into refined chemical structures that exhibit optimized pharmacologic properties in addition we deploy advanced biologic assays biophysical approaches and computational methods to enhance our understanding of disease targets and to drive advanced drug discovery headquartered in redwood city calif at the intersection of silicon valley and the birthplace of biotechnology revolution medicines is a private company launched with  million in series a financing from third rock ventures and the column group  about us our values our team revolution product engine a revolutionary approach in drug discovery our innovative product engine draws inspiration from nature and evolution which can be a source of insights into cancer targets disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches  we pay particular attention to natural products that are inherently rich with biological function as a result of natural selection and can inform and guide our discovery and development of small molecules that can modulate such targets our use of biologically relevant chemical information from nature depends on our ability to synthesize and modify complex natural products specific portions of these complex compounds and entirely original molecules inspired by natural products our revblocks™ platform builds upon the research of the company’s academic founder martin d burke md phd who invented a transformative method for synthesizing chemical compounds including complex natural products analogs or original small molecules that are pharmaceutically optimized revblocks is a rapid standardized and powerful process for conducting advanced medicinal chemistry by assembling simple “chemical building blocks” into refined structures that have significant potential as bestinclass drug candidates revolution medicines is thus able to synthesize modify and improve many complex compounds that would be very challenging or even impossible to modify without this approach we practice this technology under an exclusive license agreement with the university of illinois in addition to our modular synthesis technology revolution medicines deploys its reveal™ platform to help guide design of compounds reveal is a knowledgedriven informatics system designed to recognize advantageous structural and functional properties of scaffolds that can be exploited to engage protein targets by learning from natures experience in this way we can elevate certain preferred compounds or portions of compouds as chemical starting points for optimization as drug candidates that will engage and modulate important disease targets this computational platform also supports the process of optimization of lead compounds product engine revblocks reveal revolution antifungal drug program introduction invasive fungal infections have become more prevalent over the past three decades due in large part to the increasing number of immunocompromised hosts and hospitalized patients with significant underlying diseases candida and aspergillus are the most common causes of invasive fungal infections and despite the introduction of broad spectrum azoles eg voriconazole and echinocandins eg caspofungin morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high indeed mortality rates from fungal diseases can be as high as  and it is estimated that there are more than a million deaths worldwide annually  more than that caused by tuberculosis or malaria there has also been a shift in epidemiology with an increase in candida and aspergillus spp resistant to available therapies resulting in the addition of these organisms to the list of qualifying pathogens under the gain act generate antiinfectives now passed by the us congress to encourage development of antiinfective drugs there is an urgent need for new broad spectrum cidal antifungal agents with a high barrier to development of resistance amphotericin b amb is a powerful broadspectrum antifungal compound found in nature that has remarkably avoided generating significant drug resistance in  years of clinical use produced by streptomyces nodosus a filamentous bacterium it was discovered as a fungicidal compound in  at the squibb institute for medical research this drug is used to treat serious fungal infections and some cases of protozoan infections and is included on the world health organizations list of essential medicines the chemical structure of amb is shown below the mechanism of action of amb has been the subject of controversy despite being studied for decades following its introduction it was proposed to associate with sterol components of lipid bilayers including natural cell surface membranes and to selfassemble spontaneously into channels that are permeable to various inorganic ions indeed following the discovery in  of ion channel activity induced by amb the prevailing model to explain amb’s potent fungicidal activity has invoked the formation of these channels on the surfaces of fungi as the cause of loss of vital membrane integrity recent research in the laboratory of martin burke md phd scientific cofounder of revolution medicines at the university of illinois has provided striking new data that upend this paradigm as reported by the burke laboratory in a series of peerreviewed scientific articles amb was shown for the first time by biophysical means to bind directly to ergosterol as both a necessary and sufficient mechanism of yeast cell killing the authors concluded that amb acts as an ergosterol “sponge” that deprives membranes of the key sterol and that this mechanism is primarily responsible for cell death the discovery that binding ergosterol was sufficient for cell killing was critically enabled by synthesis of novel compounds that are based on the amb chemical backbone but have been deleted of a specific hydroxyl group at position c this hydroxyl group was predicted to be required for insertion into membranes and for formation of toxic channels the new compound cdeoamb see figure below which would otherwise have been very difficult to produce was synthesized in the burke laboratory using the building block synthesis technology that underlies revolution medicines’ revblocks synthesis platform cdeoamb was shown to retain its ability to bind ergosterol but to exhibit no detectable ion channel activity importantly this compound also retained its fungicidal activity thereby proving that its mechanism of killing is not dependent on the assembly of membrane permeabilizing channels by aggregates of the compound consistent with its doselimiting toxicity to humans additional work by the burke group showed that amb also directly binds cholesterol a key constituent of mammalian cell surface membranes they also found that modification of the c’ position leads to a derivative that selectively binds ergosterol this discovery opened the door to rationally designed modifications based on the model of sterol binding to amb shown in figure below these changes are projected to alter critical allosteric dynamics in amb that may be necessary for the molecule to accommodate binding to cholesterol indeed several such derivatives were shown to retain ergosterol binding with only minimal or even undetectable residual cholesterol binding importantly these cholesterolindependent compounds exhibited antifungal activity with markedly reduced toxicity to mammalian cells as measured in in vitro assays with human renal epithelial cells or red blood cells as surrogates these findings demonstrate that it is possible to separate antifungal activity from toxicity to mammalian cells based on differential binding of speciesspecific sterols additionally initial studies in murine models of systemic candida infection demonstrated marked clearance of pathogenic organisms by these new compounds at dose levels that were well tolerated by the rodent hosts suggesting that such molecules may have an improved therapeutic index compared to amb itself subsequent work by the burke group working in collaboration with dr susan lindquist and colleagues at the whitehead institute evaluated some of these compounds designed rationally from the amb backbone experimentally forced selection for yeast that are relatively resistant to these antifungal compounds revealed the same pattern that has been observed previously in selection for amb resistance organisms exhibiting relative in vitro resistance to the cholesterolindependent compounds are not pathogenic in vivo revealing that the emergence to such resistance is coupled to substantial reductions in microbial fitness and associated reduction in pathogenicity collectively the experimental findings with these compounds reported to date suggest an exciting opportunity and path to engineering and developing new medicines based on the amb backbone provided by nature based on the new mechanistic understanding such compounds may have improved safety for patients preserved or increased antifungal activity and low propensity to select for pathogenic variants that are resistant to the compounds revolution medicines is currently conducting extensive preclinical studies with the aim of qualifying clinical candidates for further development antifungal drug program microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must allow firstparty and thirdparty cookies and you must

relevant bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach what is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free we’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your

target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you

treatment will not reduce the effectiveness of revolution stiff hair clumping of hair hair discoloration or a slight powdery residue may be observed at the treatment site in some animals these effects are temporary and do not affect the safety or effectiveness of the product discard empty tubes in your ordinary household refuse flea control in dogs and cats for the prevention and control of flea infestations revolution should be administered at monthly intervals throughout the flea season starting one month before fleas become active in controlled laboratory studies  of fleas were killed within  hours results of clinical field studies using revolution monthly demonstrated  control of flea infestations within  days of the first dose dogs and cats treated with revolution including those with preexisting flea allergy dermatitis showed improvement in clinical signs associated with fleas as a direct result of eliminating the fleas from the animals and their environment if the dog or cat is already infested with fleas when the first dose of revolution is administered adult fleas on the animal are killed and no viable fleas hatch from eggs after the first administration however an environmental infestation of fleas may persist for a short time after beginning treatment with revolution because of the emergence of adult fleas from pupae heartworm prevention in dogs and cats for the prevention of heartworm disease revolution must be administered on a monthly basis revolution may be administered yearround or at least within one month after the animals first exposure to mosquitoes and monthly thereafter until the end of the mosquito season the final dose must be given within one month after the last exposure to mosquitoes if a dose is missed and a monthly interval between dosing is exceeded then immediate administration of revolution and resumption of monthly dosing will minimize the opportunity for the development of adult heartworms when replacing another heartworm preventive product in a heartworm disease prevention program the first dose of revolution must be given within a month of the last dose of the former medication selamectin the active ingredient in revolution is a macrocyclic lactone compound these compounds effectively prevent the development of adult heartworms when administered to dogs and cats within one month of exposure to infective l dirofilaria immitis larvae efficacy of macrocyclic lactones decreases below  in dogs however if first administered  months after exposure to infective larvae thus in heartworm endemic regions delaying initiation of heartworm prevention using revolution beyond  months of first exposure to infective larvae eg starting puppies and kittens at  weeks of age or gaps of  months in the administration of revolution during periods of heartworm transmission increases the risk of the animal acquiring heartworms animals with unknown heartworm history that test negative for heartworms prior to the initiation of revolution may be harboring prepatent infections at the time revolution was started testing such animals  months after initiation of revolution would be necessary to confirm their negative heartworm status at the discretion of the veterinarian cats  months of age may be tested to determine the presence of existing heartworm infections before beginning treatment with revolution cats already infected with adult heartworms can be given revolution monthly to prevent further infections ear mite treatment in dogs and cats for the treatment of ear mite o cynotis infestations in dogs and cats revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose a second monthly dose may be required in some dogs monthly use of revolution will control any subsequent ear mite infestations in the clinical field trials ears were not cleaned and many animals still had debris in their ears after the second dose cleansing of the infested ears is recommended to remove the debris sarcoptic mange treatment in dogs for the treatment of sarcoptic mange s scabiei in dogs revolution should be administered once as a single topical dose a second monthly dose may be required in some dogs monthly use of revolution will control any subsequent sarcoptic mange mite infestations because of the difficulty in finding sarcoptic mange mites on skin scrapings effectiveness assessments also were based on resolution of clinical signs resolution of the pruritus associated with the mite infestations was observed in approximately  of the dogs  days after the first treatment and in approximately  of the dogs  days after the second monthly treatment tick control in dogs for the control of tick dermacentor variabilis infestations in dogs revolution should be administered on a monthly basis in heavy tick infestations complete efficacy may not be achieved after the first dose in these cases one additional dose may be administered two weeks after the previous dose with monthly dosing continued thereafter nematode treatment in cats for the treatment of intestinal hookworm a tubaeforme and roundworm t cati infections revolution should be applied once as a single
