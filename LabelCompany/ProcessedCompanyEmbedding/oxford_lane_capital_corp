accelerate large loss of principle in times of distressvery high fees take excess returns out of investors pocketsmediocre net total return not enough to compensate investors for risk oxford lane capital corp nasdaqoxlc is a highly levered collateralized loan obligation clo cef with extremely high concentration in the illiquid subordinated loan tranches of clos we view this highrisk cef which incorporates three levels of leverage along with exorbitant management fees as the poster child for what went wrong in the collateralized mortgage obligation market in  the likely high correlation among its top  holdings which account for over  of its portfolio means that in a period of distress in the highyield market investors are likely to experience a significant loss of principal what is a clo a clo is a structured product securitized by a portfolio of highyield bank loans it is structured in various tranches that have different credit ratings and interest rates with different priority claims on the underlying collateral as one moves down in the clo capital structure the more susceptible to defaults the tranche becomes and thus the riskier it is the highest rated tranche of a clo is typically rated aaa and sold to pension funds this tranche is typically priced at libor  bp and enjoy high default protection since the lowest tranche in the capital structure typically the equity tranche will begin to absorb losses first above the equity tranche is the subordinated tranche which is the space that oxford plays in these tranches are highly speculative usually with ratings in the bb or b category with yield in the mid to high teens if the underlying portfolio of loans begins to default this tranche will quickly begin to experience losses how does oxford calculate nav levels   and  describe a companys assets based on the degree of certainty around the assets underlying value level  assets can be valued with certainty because they are liquid and have clear market prices at the other end of the spectrum level  assets are illiquid and estimating their value requires inputs that are unobservable and reflect management assumptions level  securities are securities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market examples include active exchangetraded equity securities listed derivatives most us government and agency securities and certain other sovereign government obligations level  assets can be looked up on a major exchange to determine price level  securities are assets whose values are based on their quoted prices in inactive markets or whose values are based on models  but the inputs to those models are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset level  inputs include restricted stock corporate and municipal bond most over the counter derivatives such as interest rate and currency swaps mortgagerelated securities level  securities are assets whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement these inputs reflect managements own assumptions about the assumptions one would use in pricing the asset examples include private equity residential and commercial mortgagerelated assets and clos level  assets trade infrequently as a result there are not many reliable market prices for them valuations of these assets are typically based on management assumptions or expectations  of oxfords investments are level  this means the nav is determined via oxford managements models using its assumptions as inputs ten different analyses by  different managers would almost certainly come up with  different values for nav considering their own proprietary models and input assumptions ill leave it to the reader to determine if they believe oxford would err on the side of caution when calculating its portfolio nav oxfords top five positions given that oxford owns a majority of the class in each subordinated tranche it owns liquidity is low to nonexistent at prices close to its modeled values five subordinated tranches comprise almost  of oxfords portfolio this high concentration means that only one investment needs to become impaired for cef investors to lose substantial principal three layers of leverage oxfords portfolio of clos is leverage upon leverage upon leverage the first layer of leverage inherent in the portfolio is due to the nature of the underlying collateral itself highyield banks loans while typically secured are usually part of the capital structure of highly levered junkrated companies these companies by their very nature use a high degree of leverage to generate returns the second layer of leverage inherent in the portfolio results from the tranches in which oxford concentrates its investments the subordinated tranches of clos that substantially comprise the entirety of oxfords portfolio are leveraged investments themselves they offer high returns in exchange for high exposure to default rates these are among the first tranches to become impaired if the underlying collateral begins to experience defaults the third level of leverage results from the use of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to further lever the portfolio its easy to see how in good times this triple leverage will juice returns however in times of distress this can lead to a significant loss of principal are you getting compensated for the risk assuming oxfords portfolio is priced at fair value or close by definition investors in the cef will never be paid the appropriate risk premium for the risk they are assuming this is simply because the management fee of  is likely removing all of the alpha this portfolio can generate this means that if an index of clos to which this cefs return could be compared existed the likelihood that oxford would outperform this index is almost zero in other words any likely excess return resulting from oxfords good management is being eaten up by fees oxfords fiveyear total nav return was  which means gross return was close to  before oxford took its fees ouch premium to nav over the years oxford has traded at a significant premium to nav reaching almost  in  over the past two years it has traded at an average of roughly  to nav it currently trades at a slight discount to nav of  as a result of a drop in market price after the company announced it was cutting its dividend  given oxfords net total return since inception and very high management fees we believe it should trade at a substantial discount to nav to compensate holders for the underlying risk we would avoid this cef and reevaluate should its discount approach  disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks
