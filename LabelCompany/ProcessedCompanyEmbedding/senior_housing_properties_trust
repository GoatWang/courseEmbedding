search is senior housing properties trust a buy the trends look good for healthcare real estate  is this the way to play it matthew frankel tmfmathguy apr   at pm photo scott jacob mesa royale apartments ive written several times about the merits of healthcare real estate as a longterm investment and senior housing properties are one of my favorite types so senior housing properties trust nasdaqsnh would seem like a logical choice however just because i like the industry doesnt make senior housing properties trust a great company lets take a closer look at this healthcare reit and see how it stacks up against my favorite healthcare reit sector heavyweight welltower nysehcn how does senior housing properties trust make its money as a real estate investment trust or reit senior housing properties trust has as its main business acquiring properties and leasing them to tenants and as the name implies this reits properties are mainly related to senior housing and related healthcare operations currently the company owns  properties   of which are some variety of senior housing assisted living independent living or skilled nursing facilities and  are medical office buildings source senior housing properties trust most of the properties are privatepay which created limited exposure to government reimbursement  which creates a big question mark for the future of many peers and the company is well diversified both geographically and among its  tenants finally senior housing properties partners with some of the best operators in the business to run their facilities including five star senior living brookdale senior living and sunrise senior living why invest in senior housing basically there are two main compelling reasons to invest in senior housing and healthcare in general first the market is highly fragmented the healthcare real estate market is estimated to be about  trillion in size and even the largest reits have less than a  market share so there is tremendous opportunity for consolidation ahead second and most importantly the demographics indicate that the future will hold a lot of demand for senior housing properties the us population is aging rapidly and with millions of baby boomers getting ready to retire there will be a tremendous need for senior housing in fact during the year period from  to  the plus population is expected to grow by  source senior housing properties trust capital structure this is one area where senior housing properties trust looks a little riskier than its peers less than half  of the companys capitalization consists of equity while the other  is debt and about onefifth of the debt is mortgagebased meaning that the loans are secured by the underlying properties both of these metrics are significantly higher than those of major competitors the result of this level of debt is an interest coverage ratio of  in other words senior housing properties trust earns  for every dollar in interest it needs to pay this may sound pretty good  and it indeed provides the company with a nice cushion before it would become unprofitable but it significantly lags behind some of the industrys heavyweights for comparison welltowers debt makes up just under  of its capitalization resulting in a much more comfortable interest coverage of  and the company has committed to maintaining a  equitydebt ratio on all new capital raised since  dividends and performance history as far as dividends go senior housing properties trust pays a  annual dividend which translates into an impressive  yield as of this writing even more impressive is that it appears to be sustainable at  of the companys normalized funds from operations ffo  on the higher end but pretty normal for a reit for comparison welltower pays out  of its ffo but it produces a lower  dividend yield however the dividend history isnt quite so impressive sure the company has a decent history of increases but there are two things to point out from the following chart source senior housing properties trust most obviously notice that there havent been any increases for the past three years ive written before that a stocks ability to sustainably increase its dividend every year is a big factor in my decision to invest simply put a stagnant dividend looks great now but it wont look as great in a few years as inflation erodes its purchasing power additionally note that the dividend has only grown by an average of  per year since   not the type of longterm growth rate we want to see for comparisons sake the aforementioned welltower has increased its dividend at an average rate of  over its year history now im not saying this record makes senior housing properties trust a bad dividend stock by any means just that it lags behind peers in certain key metrics as far as performance is concerned the stock has produced an average total return of  per year for its investors over the past  years  not too bad at all this handily beats the sp over the same time period but it does fall short of welltowers performance in fairness past performance doesnt necessarily predict future results  but it can be a pretty good indicator valuation compared to peers i mentioned funds from operations ffo a little while ago this should be thought of as the earnings of the reit world as it is the best representation of how much money these companies are actually making having said that lets take a look at how senior housing properties trust stacks up to some of its peers company share price as of   ffo normalized if available pffo senior housing properties trust snh    welltower hcn    hcp hcp    physicians realty trust doc    senior housing properties trust certain trades at the low end of the valuation spectrum which can help to make up for the higherthanpeers debt load and the added risk that comes with it so is it a buy on paper there are several reasons why one might want to go with one of the healthcare reit giants such as welltower  lower debt stronger track record of performance and so on however senior housing property trust is a solid and stable company with a dividend yield of nearly  which is rare additionally while its performance history may not be quite up to the level of its peers a  average total return sustained over a year period is still pretty impressive and the fact that a stock with such a metric trades for just  times earnings make it look pretty cheap to me as long as youre aware of the extra risk going in like the higher debt load i discussed senior housing

search better buy hcp inc vs senior housing properties trust which of the two seniorfocused reits is the best buy now matthew frankel tmfmathguy jun   at pm healthcare real estate is an interesting longterm opportunity as the aging us population should translate into steady demand growth for healthcare senior housing is one of my favorite ways to invest in healthcare over the long term as it will be a particularly strong beneficiary of the aging population and doesnt rely too much on government reimbursement programs like medicare and medicaid to generate income two of the most senior housingfocused reits are hcp inc nysehcp and senior housing properties trust nasdaqsnh heres a quick rundown of the companies and which one is the better buy right now image source getty images comparing the companies hcp underwent a major repositioning in  with the spinoff of its skilled nursing assets into a newly created reit now the company has approximately  properties  of which are senior housing  are medical offices and  are lifescience properties  of hcps portfolio is made up of privatepay revenue sources which is generally more stable than properties dependent on government reimbursements image source hcp investor presentation on the other hand senior housing properties trust owns  properties and concentrates on just two main property types senior housing makes up  of the portfolio and medical offices make up  there are smaller positions in skilled nursing facilities and wellness centers  of the companys net operating income is derived from privatepay properties by market cap senior housing properties trust is approximately onethird of hcps size image source senior housing properties trust investor presentation so both have similar focuses and are wellpositioned to benefit from the aging us population hcp is larger and has a more diverse mix of properties while senior housing properties trust has an edge in privatepay revenue dividend and performance history senior housing properties trust has the higher dividend of the two with an annual yield of  versus  for hcp until last years spinoff transaction hcp maintained a fantastic record of dividend increases in fact the company was a member of the sp  dividend aristocrats index having raised its dividend for more than  consecutive years now that the spinoff is complete and the accompanying dividend reduction has been made it remains to be seen whether the company will continue to increase its payout going forward senior housing properties trust has a strong track record of dividend payments but it has not increased its dividend since  however the companys ffo payout ratio has dropped in recent years and now sits at  of normalized ffo so theres room for increases in the future in a nutshell both companies have strong but not perfect dividend histories despite the higher dividend yield theres not a major difference in the historical performance of the two companies in fact the total returns produced by both stocks over the past  years are nearly identical snh total return price data by ycharts valuation the companies have similar portfolios and have delivered similar performances for investors also both are in similar financial shape senior housing properties trusts has a  leverage ratio while hcp projects that it will have leverage in the  to  range once announced dispositions have been completed so lets take a look at each companys valuation to see which might be the better choice right now company recent price  ffo pffo hcp    senior housing properties trust    data sources guidance obtained from each companys most recent quarterly report and adjustednormalized ffo figures were used where applicable stock prices are as of  hcps ffo is excluding the effects of spunoff assets which is the best buy to be clear im a fan of both stocks and own hcp in my personal portfolio both companies have similar business models and have produced nearly identical returns for shareholders however senior housing properties looks like a far more compelling value right now so if i were to buy one of the two today thats the one id go with matthew frankel owns shares of hcp
