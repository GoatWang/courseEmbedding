activities have become primary creators of new jobs accounting for over  of new jobs globally since mids they are vital to poverty alleviation and key to realizing the mdgs both directly –in terms of enhancing the availability and affordability of education health energy itc services and indirectly –by alleviating poverty and empowering women through entrepreneurial and employment creation opportunities in services enterprises misconceptions about services when a developing country or transitional economy has scarce resources the development priority should be industry not services –this is based on idea that services are primarily to satisfy final demand developing countries do not have a comparative advantage in services exports and having a negative balance in their trade in services is normal developing and transition economies benefit from services trade liberalization primarily through attracting increased fdi and exporting labour and not through making their own domestic service sector more competitive if domestic demand for services is low the focus on developing the services sector will fail prerequisites for stimulating services growth stimulate demand for quality services a strong proactive policy framework and a coherent domestic regulation meet regional and international standards reinforce the interlinkages among service subsectors to produce dynamic effects establish effective mechanisms of coordination in planning and implementation conclusion it has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of economic growth education in the developing world a study conducted by the unesco international institute for educational planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spillover effect on the system as a whole lack of good universities and a low acceptance rate for good universities is evident in countries with a high population density in some countries there are uniform over structured inflexible centralized programs from a central agency that regulates all aspects of education information technology research and development education mass media consultation importance of information technology in the business environment information technology has transformed the way companies do business manual business functions have been automated with the development of personal computers business software and internetbased intranets while companies may develop internal business technology to increase the effectiveness of business functions they may also use personal digital products to enhance operations developing different uses for information technology and various computerrelated devices can help companies develop a competitive advantage facts companies often use information technology in their business operations because of consumer expectations many consumers conduct copious amounts of research prior to spending money on goods or services this research is often done on internet websites and with information from other electronic databases or resources companies that do not provide a digital footprint on the internet for consumers conducting research may discover that their products are not be included in this review process features information technology allows companies to reach a larger group of consumers in the economic marketplace resources such social media networks email marketing popup banner ads on internet websites and other technologybased items can help companies saturate the economic marketplace companies may also be able to use these resources to reach a younger target market or demographic group younger consumers are often more attached to information technology products than older consumers considerationscompanies may use information technology to develop business relationships with other companies many retail operations use websites to sell goods or services to consumers companies may partner with these retailers to sell their goods over the internet through an established retail chains website companies that have traditionally been unable to sell products directly to consumers such as manufactures or producers may use website retailers for moving products rather than a traditional supply chain significanceleveraging information technology in business operations can create a significant competitive advantage for companies high technology may allow companies to advance new ways for producing goods or services at cheaper costs companies may then be able to pass these cost savings on to consumers generating a low price point for products companies may also be able to develop specific business technologies that the other companies are unable to duplicate resulting in an operational competitive advantage warningscompanies using copious amounts of information technology in business operations or marketing strategies may face consumer backlash from these impersonal methods of conducting business consumers may decide that companies using too much information technology are more interested in saving costs than generating longstanding relationships in the economic marketplace companies may be able to avoid this negative perception by using more employees to create a personal approach when dealing with customer situations rather than using technology service sector quaternary sector of industryfull transcriptmore presentations by kamran khalid untitled preziuntitled prezicopy of quaternary sector
