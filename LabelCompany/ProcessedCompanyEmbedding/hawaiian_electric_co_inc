property plant and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property plant and equipment this means it is the cost of the property plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation explanation a company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive the company replaces when it wears out on the other hand a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows
