examples examples  preparation of dry particles containing hgh  in a preferred aspect of the present invention it was desired to prepare inhalable dry particles containing hgh human growth hormone that would maximize the amount of active hgh that reached the alveolar space to do so it was determined that the inhalable dry particles should have a fpf of at least about  and a fpf of at least about  it was also desired to have at least  of the hgh in the dry particles be “readily extractable” that is soluble in buffer solution when the hgh is exposed to incompatible components for example organic solutions such as ethanol solution the hgh degrades or denatures resulting in degradation products that include insoluble aggregates and soluble dimer the method and apparatus of the present invention were developed to minimize the amount of insoluble aggregates and soluble dimer in the finished dry particles by minimizing the contact between the hgh solution and the incompatible ethanol solution by combining them rapidly in a static mixer  the following examples illustrate preparation of inhalable dry particles containing hgh unless indicated otherwise bulk raw hgh was supplied by eli lilly inc as lyophilized powder  dipalmitoylsnglycerophosphocholine dppc was obtained from avanti polar lipids usp grade  proof ethyl alcohol and usp united states pharmacopeia sterile water for irrigation were used  wt  hgh wt  dppc wt  sodium phosphate  the dry particles were prepared in accordance with the following procedure using equipment substantially the same as that illustrated in fig  the lyophilized hgh powder was allowed to warm to room temperature for at least ½ hour the hgh was dissolved in  mm sodium phosphate buffer ph  to form a concentrated hgh solution the ph of the hgh concentrate was increased to  using  n naoh the hgh concentrate was passed through a millipore  μm opticap filter the concentration of the hgh concentrate was determined using a beckman du®  spectrophotometer the hgh concentrate solution was diluted with  mm sodium phosphate buffer ph  to achieve an hgh concentration of  gkg the resulting aqueous solution was transferred to a sealed vessel such as feed vessel  the organic solution was prepared by dissolving the dppc in  proof ethyl alcohol to a concentration of  gkg the organic solution was transferred into a sealed vessel such as feed vessel   the aqueous phase was pumped at  mlmin± mlmin and the organic phase was pumped at  mlmin± mlmin into a twelve inch long static mixer such as static mixer  the combination liquid flowed from the static mixer into a rotary atomizer such as atomizer  using a  vaned rotary atomizer wheel niro operating at  rpm± rpm the combination was atomized into small droplets which entered the niro size  spray dryer such as spray dryer  utilizing dry nitrogen gas flowing at  kghr± kghr the inlet temperature of the spray dryer was maintained at ° c±° c such that the outlet temperature fell within the range of ° c±° c the particles were collected in a bag house such as bag house  the resulting dry particles had a mean mmad of  μm and a mean vmgd of  μm  sizeexclusion hplc was used to detect and quantitate aggregate formation in the resulting dry particles as described in more detail below samples were dissolved in  mm phosphate buffer ph  and in   mm phosphate buffer ph  containing  npropanol and filtered through  μm syringe filters prior to chromatography using this technique hgh elutes as monomer main peak at a retention time of  to  minutes the appearance of a leading shoulder on the monomer main peak indicates the presence of soluble dimer the amount of soluble dimer and soluble monomer can be obtained by determining their respective peak areas the amount of insoluble aggregate is calculated from the following formula insoluble aggregate −ab×area correction×  amonomer peak area of hgh dry particles dissolved in  mm phosphate buffer  bmonomer peak area of hgh dry particles dissolved in   mm phosphate buffer ph  containing  npropanol  area correction accounts for the difference of the hgh standard peak area between injections from  npropanol and buffer  size exclusion hplc was carried out using a waters  hplc system operating in isocratic mode with a waters  uv detector and a tosohas tsk gsw  μm  mm× mm column the size exclusion column was run at  mlmin using a  m phosphate bufferisopropyl alcohol  mobile phase at ph  uv detection was at  nm  an alternative method for determining soluble and insoluble aggregates in protein such as hgh is described below this method is performed using size exclusion hplc with detection at  nm on a waters  system with a waters  dual wavelength detector a tsk gel sw  mm× mm column is used for the separation with a  mm potassium phosphate ph  containing  ipa mobile phase flowing at  mlmin for  minrun at room temperature manual integration is performed to quantify monomer high molecular weight protein soluble aggregates and acid dissolved hgh insoluble aggregates areas versus a hgh reference standard calibration curve  the procedure is as follows  weigh  mg of hgh into a scintillation vial and transfer in  ml of diluent  mm potassium phosphate this is approximately  mgml hgh monomer  gently disperse powder solution  remove approximately  ml and filter into an hplc vial and inject  μl onto the se hplc column this solution is used to determine the hgh monomer content and the amount of high molecular weight protein soluble aggregates  remove a further  ml and transfer to a centrifuge tube perform in duplicate  centrifuge for  minutes at  rpm remove and discard the supernatant  wash the pellet to remove soluble hgh with  ml of water and centrifuge for  minutes repeat this three times  following the third washing and removal of the water centrifuge the tubes one more time to remove any remaining water do not disrupt the pellet  reconstitute the pellet with  ml of n hcl and allow it to dissolve for  minutes  transfer the solution to a hplc vial and inject  μl onto the column  the buffer soluble hgh content is determined from the injection of the first solution the insoluble hgh content is determined from injection of the second solution in n hcl the percent readily extractable hgh is calculated as buffer soluble hgh divided by total hgh content soluble plus insoluble hgh  three experimental runs were made to determine the effect of time in the incompatible ethanol solution on the integrity of the hgh protein for two of the experiments a static mixer was not used rather the aqueous and organic solutions were combined and the combination was maintained for a period of time prior to atomization and spray drying in the first experiment sample  in table

of the present invention the formation of protein aggregates can be minimized reduced protein aggregation is achieved through the use of the static mixer and by controlling the level of ethanol in the ethanol solution  a comparison of powders produced with either batch or static mixing is shown below in table  all of the lots were produced using substantially the same process materials and process conditions the five combined lots produced with batch mixing generate a lower level of high molecular weight hmw protein soluble dimerhmw protein than is generated using a static mixing process n lots batch mixing of the spraydry solution containing  ethanol appears beneficial as it might allow time to disrupt hydrophobic interactions between the hgh molecules and thus reduce hgh aggregation when ethanol is added to the diluted hgh aqueous phase via the static mixer a prolonged ethanolaqueous interface occurs and this results in powders having somewhat higher levels of soluble aggregates this occurs because the hgh in the aqueous phase is exposed to higher than optimal ethanol levels which can cause the hgh to unfold and denature if a static mixer is used for the mixing process then the hgh is preferably added as a concentrate to a diluted ethanolaqueous phase this is equivalent to adding the hgh last in batch mixing this is preferred because it eliminates exposing the hgh to high ethanol levels which can perturb its protein structure the effect of the order of addition on soluble aggregate dimer levels as a function of ethanol concentration is shown in fig  the soluble aggregates level is reduced by adding the hgh last right column until the ethanol concentration exceeds about  table insolublelots n hgh monomerhmw proteinaggregatesmixingbatchstatic  conversely at higher levels of ethanol  destabilization of the protein structure may occur and static mixing was demonstrated to be a better method of mixing because it reduces the time of exposure of the hgh to the ethanol phase table  this results in powders with lower levels of insoluble aggregates it has been demonstrated data not shown that the time of exposure of the hgh to the ethanol can affect the level of soluble aggregate formed in the spraydrying formulation solution table insolublelot numberhmw proteinaggregatesorganic excipient mixing etoh batch  etoh static  the addition of nonionic surfactants to solutions containing hgh significantly reduces the formation of insoluble aggregates during exposure to an airliquid interface nonionic surfactants such as tween preferentially adsorb to airwater interfaces and stabilize proteins against aggregate during processing such as spray drying however use of nonionic surfactants such as tween is not preferred in pulmonary products due to potential toxic effects however in accordance with the present invention a significant decrease in insoluble aggregates was observed when  tween was added to a solution containing  gl solids and  dppc
