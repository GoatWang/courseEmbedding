wintergreen serves as investment adviser to clients who currently own more than  of consolidatedtomoka land co cto or the company nysecto has been notified that eganjones proxy services a leading independent provider of proxy research voting recommendations and voting services to a variety of institutional investors has recommended that cto shareholders vote for each of the four wintergreen nominees and against the say on pay at ctos annual meeting on april   eganjones recommends that all shareholders vote the green proxy card based on its review of publicly available information eganjones said it believes that voting for the wintergreen nominees is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders in arriving at that conclusion it has considered the following factors            we believe that wintergreen being the largest shareholder of cto has proven its track record of improving the companys corporate governance structure and shareholder value creation as demonstrated by the following declassification of the board implementation of majority voting separation of chairman and ceo and annual say on pay voting    we believe that wintergreen nominees if elected will make significant contributions to the company as evident in their skills experience and qualifications specifically we take note of wintergreens initiative to a more diverse board by nominating evan h ho who could be the companys asset in penetrating the real estate market in china and chinese investors alike    we believe that the company acted hostile to the dissident shareholders in the process of the negotiation because if not for wintergreen suing the company wintergreens slate of nominees would not be considered    we believe that the companys compensation committee fell short of its fiduciary duties in designing a competitive and fair compensation package that is commensurate to the companys performance as a matter of fact at the  annual meeting  of the shareholders rejected the companys say on pay proposal despite of the shareholders manifestation of dissatisfaction the compensation committee still approved the increase of the cfo and general counsels base salary and even granted bonus payouts to the executives   eganjones recommends that clients vote for all wintergreens nominees on the green proxy card it is time for change at cto we

cto or the “company”cto shares since  and who currently own more than  of cto’s shareswintergreen is a longterm large shareholder in cto the success of this company is of great importance to us in addition to the governance improvements we have been able to introduce to cto through proxy initiatives over the last ten years and our ongoing attempts to engage with management in meaningful discussion and improving disclosure of corporate activity we now believe that the only way for cto to move forward is with significant change in board leadership to direct the company to focus on your interests as shareholders seeking valuewintergreen is committed to the success of cto and our nominees are not only qualified they will offer a fresh perspective and new ways of thinking to unlock value in contrast to the mindset presently in the boardroom we intend to focus the portfolio of investment properties embark on a meaningful buyback program and transform this company into a more transparent tax efficient shareholder focused companywintergreen believes that cto with proper management and oversight has tremendous potentialour highly qualified and experienced board nominees will do all they can to unlock itwe appreciate your supportplease vote the green proxy cardvisit httpwwwenhancectocom for more information about this proxy solicitationthe full text of the letter is included belowmarch  dear fellow consolidatedtomoka shareholdermore than  years ago wintergreen advisers llc “wintergreen” made our first investment in consolidatedtomoka land company “cto” the “company” since then we have worked diligently – both behind the scenes and through more visible proxy matters – to improve cto for all shareholdersit is time for change at ctothe current board of directors the “board” and management of cto have made it clear to us that they are neither up to the task of improving cto nor are they interested in doing so as a result we have nominated a slate of four highly qualified director candidates to begin the process of realizing cto’s true value for all shareholders the company’s ongoing narrative about us and our intentions is simply not true we believe the company is seeking to distract you from cto’s poor execution of a flawed business plan and john albright’s ongoing personal sales of his cto stock in just the past two years mr albright has sold more than  shares of cto demonstrating what we view as his lack of confidence in cto’s future the company he runs and you ownmr albright is the seller not wintergreen the records speak for themselvessince wintergreen’s initial purchase in  we have never reduced our position in cto and in november  we added  shares to our holdings the company’s narrative of any sort of a liquidity issue at wintergreen is simply false as demonstrated in our registered fund’s publiclyavailable financial statements we have ample cash on hand and we are significantly larger than cto our objective is to enhance cto’s value in a tax efficient and thoughtful manner for the benefit of all shareholders if we were interested in selling wintergreen’s common stock of the company we would have followed up on the companys repeated interest in repurchasing at a mutually agreeable price the stock held by wintergreen in december of  and again in january of  the company repeated its interest in buying all or a portion of our stake in the companyas owners of  of the outstanding shares of cto our goals are closely aligned with yours to maximize the value of cto in a tax efficient manner despite many of the actions of the company’s board and management we see great value in the company and what it can become we are ready willing and able to step up and unlock the true value of the company for all shareholderswintergreen’s plan for ctowintergreen intends to take a thoughtful longterm taxefficient approach to overseeing cto’s investments and operations our initial list of tasks will includeread more a review of assets procedures status of pending transactions outside service providers and assess the management team we believe that there are some competent and qualified employees at cto we have no present intention to remove mr albright as chief executive however like all others his performance will be reviewed review nonpublic information regarding assets and terms of transactions and investments relative strengths of existing assets and prioritize changes as necessary review role quality of performance costs etc of outside service providers and consultants implementing changes as needed conduct a thorough evaluation of other aspects of the companys business and operations  focus the  portfolio on one or two attractive real estate sectors and roll less attractive securities into better assets the focus will be on quality and not simply on churning holdings to hit compensation targets every transaction will have the objective of making cto more attractive to investors and potential acquirers wellregarded real estate investment companies with an extensive  portfolio tend to have a theme to their investments that makes them desirable to fill a precise role in investors’ portfolios and we believe that cto would benefit from this approach enhance efforts to maximize the value of cto’s historical undeveloped volusia county land assets real estate land sales run in cycles and it is important to not just sell off land but to do so thoughtfully to achieve attractive increased value for cto shareholders work with tax experts to maximize tax efficiency for shareholders endeavor to reduce dilution – good work by executives and other employees should be rewarded but we believe this should be done in a manner that does not seek to disproportionately reward management with  of the company’s earnings as the cto board proposed last year all employees including management should be paid well but in a much less dilutive and more shareholder friendly manner than the board currently proposes specifically we expect compensation plans to include an enhanced ability to claw back awards made to members of management holding them accountable for reckless actions that cause harm to the company and its shareholders in addition we expect performance metrics that are tied to real results that benefit shareholders rather than metrics such as the volume of land sales without regard to their size or the quality of the deal buy back stock at discounts to estimated net asset value for too long the company has refused to enact a meaningful share buyback program we believe the reason for this is that it would have increased wintergreen’s ownership percentage of the company when the company is trading at a meaningful discount to nav we intend to conduct meaningful share buybacks with the repurchased shares being retired although the company has recently touted a new buyback program we question the company’s commitment and ability to execute given the issues with the last buyback program in the july  press release that announced the results of deutsche bank’s evaluation of ways to maximize shareholder value through the sale of cto or through the liquidation of cto’s assets the company indicated that it had intended to complete the  million remaining on the buyback program by the end of  the company failed falling  million short despite continuing to trade at a meaningful discount to nav which raises the question whether the company intended to complete the buyback furthermore in the fourth quarter of  john albright sold cto shares in an amount equal to over  of cto’s buybacks over the same period  implement an incentive system that encourages value creation for shareholders at a reasonable cost with understandable metrics wintergreen will initiate the replacement of the compensation plan with a simplified plan that directly ties pay to stock performance and other readily measurable metrics when shareholders win only then should management win wintergreen will not endorse an executive compensation plan that issues shares to executives that are greater than what is permitted by the irs code section m the current board did just that and as a result will be causing the company to pay an unnecessarily high tax bill because of the erroneous awarding of stock in excess of what is anticipated by the tax code  perhaps most importantly wintergreen will create a culture at cto where the board and management think like owners we will create a culture that puts respect for and fair treatment of shareholders ahead of interests of management the key elements of this approach are strong disclosure thoughtful investments a meaningful share buyback program and work in the best interests of all shareholders we think like shareholders because we are shareholderswintergreen believes that cto with proper management and oversight has tremendous potentialour highly qualified and experienced board nominees will do all they can to unlock itto execute our longterm value creating plan for the company we have nominated four highly qualified director candidates who are committed to working in the best interests of all shareholders these candidates have significant experience investing in real estate companies and working with companies to rein in management and unlock shareholder

undervalued takeover offer for the issuer which resulted in an over  increase in the price offered for all shareholderscto shareholders and the investment community have already rejected cto’s business planat the  cto annual meeting of shareholders the “annual meeting” over  of the total votes cast at the meeting supported wintergreen’s proposal to maximize shareholder value including a majority of the shares voted excluding wintergreen’s position although the company hired deutsche bank to undertake this task we believe the strategic review was an unmitigated disaster and destined to fail from the start the blame for this failure including the failure to learn anything from the process falls squarely on the company’s board and managementthe company conducted their strategic review under the cloak of darkness and failed to meaningfully communicate to shareholders during and after the process after the commencement of the sales process cto management initiated a flurry of sales that included  income properties a failed attempt to sell subsurface mineral rights multiple land sales and announced a mortgage financing which we believe made it impossible for prospective buyers to understand the company’s assets in addition we believe the transactions were curiously timed to meet bonus goals at the conclusion of the process the company refused at first to disclose material details of the review including what types of offers if any were received despite repeated shareholder requests for more information management refused to provide information until  months after conclusion of the process when investors at the first annual shareholder day demanded it in person perhaps due to these transactions and what we believe is the company’s currently disorganized and unfocused  portfolio and scattered real estate holdings beyond the land bank it has been in the process of selling for years the company failed to attract bids at a meaningful premium to the stock pricewhat you need to know about ctowe believe cto management has resorted to lies distortions and misdirection to avoid discussing what is really happening at the company    let’s not forget that cto sought to avoid ever having this conversation about the future of cto it took a lawsuit to get cto to acknowledge our rights as shareholders and to allow our nominees to be voted on    john albright has been an ongoing seller of cto stock over the past two years john albright has sold over  shares of cto stock worth more than  million dollars when mr albright was hired in  he reported ownership of  shares since that time he has been granted stock and options equal to  shares worth over m at  overall since his hiring he has sold over  shares of cto stock another  shares is restricted or unvested and unable to be sold which we estimate leaves mr albright with true ownership of less than  shares of stock worth less than  million john albright’s conduct suggests that he sees the company’s stock as his own personal piggy bank – he sells shares as quickly as they vest on a quarterly earnings call when he was asked about his frequent selling of shares mr albright acknowledged that institutional shareholder services “iss” frowned on ceos leveraging their company stock and so he was eliminating the leverage to try to gain a favorable review from iss however there are many ways to satisfy this goal without such aggressive and prolonged sales in contrast wintergreen has never reduced its position in cto judge for yourself whose interests are truly aligned with shareholders    we believe cto has been structured as a compensation scheme for management – at the expense of shareholders after shareholders rejected the company’s “say on pay” vote in  by a  vote against the say on pay cto had the gall to make its compensation plan even less shareholder friendly in our eyes with an estimated  shares remaining to be issued under the  plan worth over  million it is critical that wintergreen’s nominees be elected to help prevent this transfer of shareholder wealth to management   after the rejection of the say on pay vote at the  annual meeting cto’s compensation committee comprised of members john allen laura franklin howard serkin and chairman thomas warlow are proposing shareholders vote on a compensation plan that removes metrics that tie executive bonus awards to having any shareholder outreach eliminating quarterly calls eliminating investor day etc if you had any confusion on the level of respect this board has for investors this plan should be enlightening the newly proposed plan relies on a new group of companies to compare cto against anticipates awarding  of the bonus without regard to performance and rewards a potential bonus to the ceo based almost a third on the company closing land sales that the company has already contracted to sell and for which he was already paid a bonus last year yes the current board is asking you to reward the executives twice for the same transactions even more disrespectful to shareholders the compensation committee saw fit to remove any metrics that tie executive’s bonus to share performance and removed criteria for shareholder outreach if given the opportunity wintergreen plans to remedy this failed compensation structure   cto dedicates over  pages of their  proxy to disclosure of the various compensation schemes dedicated to enriching management it is clear to us that management and this board are more focused on how to extract compensation from the company than maximizing value for all shareholders   since the company’s  executive compensation plan was approved cto has issued stock and options to management and “certain other employees” who are undisclosed in the amount of  shares – approximately  of the company that has been gifted to management and employees  shares is worth  million at today’s price  over  shares remain to be gifted to management on the  plan worth  million today voting for wintergreen’s nominees is critical to preventing this from happening   wintergreen also encourages all shareholders to vote to continue to require the company to hold “say on pay” votes annual in  wintergreen submitted a shareholder proposal to implement an annual shareholder referendum on executive compensation and we believe the company should continue to be held to this standard    we believe the board is not adequately protecting the interests of the true owners of the company – the shareholders a lack of board oversight of management and ongoing wasteful use of shareholder funds are detrimental to all shareholders and we would seek to immediately rein in management and reverse these value destroying moves   a wintergreen questions the motive behind the recent purchase of the lpga golf course the golf course purchase was described by daytona beach city commissioner rob gilliland in the daytona beach news journal as a “golden goose” for the city albright has described the golf course as a “large loser” that has cost the company over  million in golf operations since  how is it in shareholder interests to commit millions of dollars in cash and land plus additional amounts to upgrade the courses to purchase the course the city estimated m in losses over  years in the event the course reverted to city ownership this transaction clearly benefits the city of daytona but how or if it benefits shareholders of cto has never been disclosed we believe it has not been accretive to shareholder value   b we believe the company’s scattershot approach to building a portfolio of investment properties is a failed strategy recent acquisitions of properties anchored by struggling chains such as staples and outback many of which are at capitalization rates below stated guidance suggest a lack of discipline by management perhaps as they attempt to hit bonus metrics at the expense of shareholders   c in the company’s  annual report it was disclosed that the company intends to spend over  to build out a new headquarters at over  per square foot we believe this project should be immediately halted and all reasonable alternatives including extending the existing lease be investigated and considered   d in the first quarter of  the company purchased approximately  million in investment securities without disclosure of holdings by the third quarter of  this number had increased to  million and was accompanied by increased trading activity notably less than  months later and only after wintergreen highlighted its concerns that this activity was beyond the authority of management in letters to the company the company liquidated these investments at a loss to shareholders of approximately  plus costs with no apparent penalty to management if given the opportunity we would immediately analyze whether there are any lingering debts or liabilities related to this failed trading portfolio and would take steps to ensure that the company a year old land company never again engages in this type of purely speculative securities trading   e we also find it alarming that over a threeyear period grant thornton’s audit fees have more than doubled without a clear explanation to shareholders as to why this has occurred under the oversight of the current audit committee comprised of members laura franklin william olivari chester skinner and chairperson howard serkin audit fees have increased from  in  to over  in  an alarming increase for a company this size wintergreen believes that the engagement of a new audit firm that can undertake a thorough review of the company’s financial statements and disclosures would benefit all shareholders    we believe the company’s attempts at initiating a shareholder outreach program can only be described as disastrous management was hostile to shareholders at the december  investor day and has terminated investor calls when questions get difficult we also wonder why cto has not made the full recording of the investor day available online we believe the company also failed to meaningfully communicate with shareholders regarding last year’s sale process wintergreen intends to change the culture at cto so that this becomes a shareholder friendly and transparent company which actually listens to the concerns of its shareholders    the company’s independent board nominees do not own material amounts of stock based on public filings these nominees own less than  shares of stock – we believe shareholders simply cannot trust them to act in the best interests of shareholders john albright has been an ongoing seller of stock and we believe he views the company as his personal piggy bank as holders of  of outstanding shares wintergreen’s interests are directly aligned with all shareholders   shareholders don’t be distracted by ctofocus on the path forwardwintergreen is a longterm large shareholder in cto the success of this company is of great importance to us in addition to the governance improvements we have been able to introduce to cto through proxy initiatives over the last ten years and our ongoing attempts to engage with management in meaningful discussion and improving disclosure of corporate activity we now believe that the only way for cto to move forward is with significant change in board leadership to direct the company to focus on your interests as shareholders seeking value wintergreen is committed to the success of cto and our nominees are not only qualified they will offer a fresh perspective and new ways of thinking to unlock value in contrast to the mindset presently in the boardroom we intend to focus the portfolio of investment properties embark on a meaningful buyback program and transform this company into a more
