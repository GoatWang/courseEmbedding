nicesophiaantipolis pare valrose f nice cedex france as customary the idea of this meeting was born out during another one the present authors were attending some colloquium among the numerous meetings devoted to the endless discussion of the foundational problems of quantum theory when it struck their minds that physics after all was also an experimental science maybe they thought to themselves our very understanding ofquantum concepts would gain from more thoroughly taking into account the impressive accumulation of modern experimental results on the fundamental aspectsofquantum behaviour experiments once deemed as gedankenexperiments now become routinely feasible and farranging progresses in the practical mastering of quantum phenomena have been accomplished in the recent years the variety of domains where quantum phenomena are currently investigated is extending beyond expectations while their essential unity is ever more obvious as no physicist can seriously believe that quantum is the last word about nature thedrive tocheck thelimitsofvalidityofquantum ideas is a powerful motive behind the everincreasing precisionofitsexperimental tests butno experimental fact
