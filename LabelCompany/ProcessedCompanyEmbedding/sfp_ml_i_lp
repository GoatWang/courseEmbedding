with other suppliers products  it depends in general all single port sfp cages are designed to an industry standard the ganged sfp versions are not compatible with all other sources te and molex are providing dropin replacement zsfp products to the market but other sfp solutions may not be compatible please check with the local te representative for the answer on your exact part or application  are the sfp sfp and zsfp products backward compatible  yes in most cases the connector and cable assembly are all backward compatible – an sfp connector is a direct replacement for a sfp connector to ensure simple upgrade to customer systems as these are standard products the cable assembly will also be compatible between the systems – an sfp copper cable assembly can be inserted to a sfp cage and mate with a sfp connector on the board  is application tooling required  single port assemblies do not require application tooling a flat rock process can be used te does recommend an application tooling for the ganged and stacked assemblies  what are the pcb termination options  cages are offered in a pressfit and solder tail pcb termination for most styles  what is bellytobelly mounting  bellytobelly mounting allows a customer to install connectors and cages on both sides of a pcb this design reduces board space and is an alternative solution to stacked connectors  what are the performance requirements for the cable assembly  our sfp copper passive and active cable assemblies meet the signal integrity requirements defined by the industry msa sff we can custom engineer cable assemblies to meet the requirements of your specific system architecture  are passive or active cable assemblies required  passive cables have no signal amplification in the assembly and rely on host system electronic dispersion compensation edc for signal amplification and equalization active cable assemblies have signal amplification and equalization built into the assembly active cable assemblies are typically used in host systems that do not employ edc this solution can be a cost savings to you  what wire gauge is required  we offer sfp cable assemblies in wire gauges  through  to support customers’ specific cable routing requirements smaller wire gauges result in reduced weight improved airflow and a more flexible cable for ease of routing  what cable lengths are required  cable length and wire gauge are related to the performance characteristics of the cable assembly longer cable lengths require heavier wire gauge while shorter cable lengths can use a smaller gauge cable  are there any special customer requirements  examples of special customer requirements include custom cable lengths electrically erasable programmable readonly memory eeprom programming
