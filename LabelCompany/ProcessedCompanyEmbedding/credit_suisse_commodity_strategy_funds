sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next

these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high below average

to make individual commodity position changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component
