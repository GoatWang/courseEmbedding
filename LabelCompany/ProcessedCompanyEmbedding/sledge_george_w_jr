faculty  ba university of wisconsin  md tulane university  george sledge printquality photo the plaudits are many for george sledge physician and researcher at the indiana university school of medicine and the indiana university melvin and bren simon cancer center brilliant scientist caring physician successful mentor inspirational leader yet an anecdote relayed by sledges colleague hari nakshatri is perhaps the most revealing portrayal of all last summer at a scientific meeting in orlando a new york radiation oncologist described one of her patients in a presentation and then reported that she had personally undertaken a national search for the best clinical oncologist to treat that patient the physician she chose from all those she could have selected in the united states was george sledge george sledge is one of the most influential figures in breast cancer in our generation says jose baselga holder of the bruce a chabner chair in hematology and oncology at massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school he is a gifted clinician an amazing scientist and a deep and critical thinker the depth of his knowledge is legendary for countless women and their families sledge is a compassionate doctor providing expert care a physician who has given women his home phone number and encouraged them to use it george is a consummate clinician says kathy miller associate professor of medicine and sheila d ward scholar at the iu school of medicine he continues to serve a large and loyal patient population referring physicians seek his advice and counsel regularly i marvel at his ability to explain technically complicated molecular biology to patients and their families he is an active listener considering patients unique fears and goals when formulating their treatment plans importantly george cares deeply about his patients  celebrating their successes and mourning their losses miller says sledges laboratory has been continuously funded with external grants and the science that has emerged is on the leading edge generating more than  peerreviewed scientific papers he is recognized internationally for his work in developing and testing agents  notably the drug bevacizumab  to inhibit angiogenesis the process by which cancer stimulates the development of blood vessels to support the growth of cancer cells sledge was a leader in the research and clinical trials that established the medication paclitaxel as an important therapy for metastatic breast cancer his demonstration that the efficacy at much lower toxicity of sequential administration of another drug doxorubicin with paclitaxel triggered a profound revision of the therapeutic approach to women with metastatic breast cancer says luca gianni director of the department of medical oncology at milans istituto scientifico universitario san raffaele as leader of the breast cancer program at the iu simon cancer center sledge has created a multidisciplinary program of excellence in research and patient care expanding it to  members in the process sledge has served as a talented mentor inspiring young colleagues to do work that has made them national leaders in their cancer research specialties he has served tirelessly as a member or chair of numerous study groups and eastern cooperative oncology group clinical trials and as a member of key researchrelated committees at the department of defense the food and drug administration and the american association of clinical oncology his many contributions resulted in his election as president of american association of clinical oncology for  sledge has received numerous prestigious honors notably the komenbrinker award for scientific distinction from the susan g komen breast cancer foundation in  the jill rose award from the breast cancer research foundation in  and the  william l mcguire memorial lecture award at the rd annual san antonio breast cancer symposium clifford hudis chief of breast cancer medicine service and professor of medicine at the weill medical college of cornell university captures well sledges many contributions his is a career marked by service and selflessness he can be counted upon to confront difficult drug development decisions within both academia and industry he provides clarity and precision when he teaches and his specific contributions

genomic era cancer journal afghahi a sledge g w     abstract the advent of cancer genomics has led to the development of many highly successful targeted therapies primarily inhibitors of growth factor receptors and related kinases including imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia and trastuzumab for herpositive breast cancer this approach has become highly successful for certain cancers however as the list of targeted therapies expands their efficacy becomes more limited and toxicity accumulates what we have learned in the past decades is that while the targeted therapeutics approach may be highly successful in less complex tumors cancers defined by carcinogeninduced genomic chaos such a uvinduced melanoma or tobaccoinduced lung cancer are driven by a multitude of competing molecular pathways and as such are not as successfully managed by a similar approach luckily in the past years the field of cancer immunotherapy has become more fully developed with the emergence of checkpoint blockade inhibitor therapy these promising new agents are particularly well suited for tumors with a high mutational burden due to underlying genomic disarray while still in its infancy we predict that cancer immunotherapy will offer a better alternative to our current targeted approach and eagerly await the results of several ongoing clinical trials that will elucidate this new direction in

the future of breast cancer systemic therapy the next  years journal of molecular medicine berlin germany telli m l sledge g w     abstract over the past  years substantial progress has been made in the systemic treatment of earlystage and advanced breast cancer the use of chemotherapy in the adjuvant and metastatic settings has demonstrated proven efficacy and it has been clearly demonstrated that targeting the estrogen receptor and human growth factor receptor  her is efficacious in early and advanced disease despite these advances vexing clinical challenges remain particularly related to the treatment of triplenegative breast cancer tnbc estrogen receptor ernegative progesterone receptor prnegative and hernegative where little progress has been made therapeutically in more than a decade while recurrences of hormoneresponsive breast cancer are overall less common late relapses after cessation of endocrine therapy are a more frequent occurrence in modern times and reflect the problem of underlying tumor dormancy that as yet has not been overcome multiple molecular tools are now available to interrogate the biology of breast cancer though exactly how to make this information meaningful in the clinic has proven challenging and molecularly driven clinical trials have faced feasibility challenges in parallel focus has expanded from tumor to host with the ability to ascertain underlying germline alterations such as inherited brca and brca mutations which may be responsible for breast cancer carcinogenesis and importantly may have implications for treatment these clinical advances in germline genetics made possible by both scientific investigation as well as the courts still face challenges related to increasing encounters with variants of unknown significance and difficulty in predicting risks associated with less wellcharacterized inherited cancer predisposition syndromes in this paper we attempt to predict the next  years of breast cancer in

targets er pr and her microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers represents a novel comparator to reveal insights into tnbc heterogeneity and to inform drug development using rnasequencing data from our institution and the cancer genome atlas tcga we compared the transcriptomes of  tnbcs  microdissected normal breast tissues from healthy volunteers from the susan g komen for the cure tissue bank and  histologically normal tissues adjacent to tumor pathway analysis comparing tnbcs to optimized normal controls of microdissected normal epithelium versus classic controls composed of adjacent normal tissue revealed distinct molecular signatures differential gene expression of tnbc compared with normal comparators demonstrated important findings for tnbcspecific clinical trials testing targeted agents lack of overexpression for negative studies and overexpression in studies with drug activity next by comparing each individual tnbc to the set of microdissected normals we demonstrate that tnbc heterogeneity is attributable to transcriptional chaos is associated with nonsilent dna mutational load and explains transcriptional heterogeneity in addition to known molecular subtypes finally chaos analysis identified  core genes dysregulated in   of tnbcs revealing an overexpressed central network in conclusion use of microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers enables an optimized approach for studying tnbc and uncovers biological heterogeneity mediated by transcriptional chaos view details for doi sy view details for web of science id

perry reichanadter if you ask george sledge why he became an oncologist he doesn’t hesitate he can tell you exactly when he knew that’s what he wanted to do while an intern at st louis university he had to inform a young mother that she had leukemia “i’ll always remember what carmelita asked me” sledge said “she asked ‘who will take care of my children’” that had a huge emotional impact on me” after completing his residency sledge  went on to complete an oncology fellowship at the university of texas in san antonio studying for several years under nationally known breast cancer researcher bill mcguire when sledge came to iu in  he was the only oncologist with expertise in the area of breast cancer and it was under his leadership that iu opened its first breast clinic that’s where he’s made his mark in medical research developing life enhancing treatments and cancercare protocols that have improved the care and outcomes of breast cancer patients one area of research sledge is involved with is biologic treatments for breast cancer especially antiangiogenic therapies such as the drug avastin antiangiogenic therapies prevent the development of new blood vessels or stunt new blood vessel growth in cancer cells consequently starving them sledge also conducted studies involving the drug herceptin used in conjunction with chemotherapy to help prolong the lives of patients with metastatic her breast cancer perhaps sledge’s most farreaching contribution to breast cancer research was with taxol a chemotherapy treatment he led the first major trial in the use of taxol as a treatment for breast cancer the phase iii trial lasted from  to  with institutions nationwide participating as a result taxol is now commonly used by many breast cancer patients the findings from this trial also demonstrated that sequential use of chemotherapies which is much less toxic and easier for patients to tolerate was just as beneficial as using chemotherapies in tandem “drugs like avastin herceptin and taxol are valuable to the extent that they prolong women’s lives first and foremost” sledge said “so my career as a breast cancer researcher has been designed in large part to try and develop new agents that will prolong women’s lives and hopefully when applied to women with earlystage breast cancer increase their cure rate” as codirector of iu’s breast cancer program sledge leads a breast cancer research team of more than  members the program has produced several patents and two startup companies and is involved in more than  clinical trials its annual research grant funding now exceeds  million and it received a  million gift from the vera bradley foundation for breast cancer research “during the most recent review from the national cancer institute the breast cancer research program at the iu simon cancer center earned one of the national cancer institute’s highest rankings” said patrick loehrer sr director of the iu simon cancer center “this doesn’t just happen by chance it is a result of the hard work of george and his many colleagues from numerous disciplines together they continue to make a mark worldwide by improving the prognosis of breast cancer and increasing not only the duration of life but also the quality of life for women with this disease” over the years sledge has received several prestigious national awards such as the  william l mcguire memorial lecture award at the san antonio breast cancer symposium the  rose award from the breast cancer research foundation and the  brinker award from the komen foundation sledge has also provided leadership for numerous organizations including the fda’s oncology drug advisory committee hoosier oncology group the eastern cooperative oncology group’s breast cancer committee and the department of defense oncology drug advisory committee he currently serves as president of the american society of clinical oncology while awards and recognition are nice sledge considers his greatest achievement being able to help his patients and the beast cancer program is the vehicle that allows him to do it “like most doctors what drives me when i get up in the morning and what keeps me going during a very long day is my ability to help my patients” sledge said “i hope to continue to help the women of central indiana live better lives through the application of cuttingedge research so they will have a chance to be first in line for new therapies new drugs and new developments that will prolong their lives and minimize or eliminate their suffering” after all these years he’s still trying to ensure the “carmelitas” under his care will live to raise their children “in the breast cancer research world george sledge is a rock star” loehrer said “but he goes about his work in a downtoearth manner whether he’s talking with a patient teaching younger scientists or doing an interview with the national media to us at the iu simon cancer center and to his patients george is a true hero”•
