the september ’ quarter revenue is not predictable neither is income and the organization chart is confusing dual stock classes insiders have excessive voting control which suggests they do not want to be accountable to public shareholders  recent developments jgw estimates that total revenue net income and trb purchases for the quarter ended september   will be in the following ranges total revenue  million to  million as compared to  million for the quarter ended september   the estimated decline in quarterly revenue is due primarily to decreases in unrealized gains on vie and other finance receivables long term securitization debt and derivatives as a result of an increased interest rate environment as well as realized and unrealized gains losses on marketable securities net net income loss  million to  million as compared to  million for the quarter ended september   the estimated decrease in quarterly net income is due primarily to the decline in total revenue described earlier combined with increases in interest expense as a result of our  million term loan that was not outstanding in  general and administrative expense and provision for losses on finance receivables that were partially offset by a reduction in installment obligations expense and compensation and benefits expense total trb purchases  million to  million as compared to  million for the quarter ended september   the estimated increase in total trb purchases is primarily driven by an increase in securitized product purchases partially offset by a decline in other purchases adjusted net income for the quarter ended september   will be in the range of  million to  million as compared to  million for the quarter ended september   the decrease in adjusted net income is primarily due

provides liquidity to its customers by purchasing structured settlement annuity and lottery payment streams as well as interests in the proceeds of legal claims in the united states jgw does not make loans or take consumer credit risk as part of its business but instead purchases future payment streams owed to the customer by a high quality institutional counterparties in   of the counterparties to structured settlement payment streams that jgw purchased had an investment grade rating of “a” or better by moody’s a is the lowest of the a ratings ranking  of   in the investment business a is considered risky jgw acts as an intermediary that identifies underwrites and purchases individual payment streams from its customers aggregates those payment streams and then finances them in the institutional market at discount rates below its cost to purchase jgw believes its scale allows it to operate more efficiently and cost effectively than its competition generating strong profitability while offering a lowcost source of liquidity for its customers as compared to alternative sources of liquidity such as personal loans or cash advances on credit cards two brands jgw operates two market leading and highly recognizable brands jg wentworth and peachtree each of which generates a significant volume of inbound inquiries brand awareness is critical to its marketing efforts as there are no readily available lists of holders of structured settlements annuities or potential presettlement customers since  jgw has invested  million in marketing to establish its brand names and increase customer awareness through multiple media outlets according to kantar media since  both jg wentworth and peachtree have spent approximately fivetimes the amount spent by the nearest industry competitor on television advertising and together have spent over  of the total amount spent by all of the major participants in the industry as a result of its substantial marketing investment jgw believes that its core brands jg wentworth and peachtree are the  andor  most recognized brands in their product categories in addition since  jgw has been building proprietary databases of current and prospective customers which jgw continues to grow through jgw’s significant marketing efforts and which jgw considers a key differentiator from its competitors as of july   jgw’s customer databases include more than  current and prospective structured settlement customers with  billion of unpurchased structured settlement payment streams which includes all potential payment streams that customers disclosed to jgw at its initial contact with them since july   jgw has continued to add to its customer databases and to purchase structured settlement payment streams from its customers who may also sell payment streams to others and therefore the amount of unpurchased structured settlement payment streams in jgw’s databases may now be greater or smaller jgw also maintains databases of presettlement and lotteries customers the strength of jgw’s databases and the resulting predictable pipeline of opportunities is demonstrated by the level of repeat business jgw experiences with its customers of the total structured settlement customers jgw has served since  the average customer has completed two separate transactions with jgw these additional purchasing opportunities come with low incremental acquisition costs competition jgw’s main competitors in the structured settlement payments purchasing market are stone street capital imperial holdings novation
