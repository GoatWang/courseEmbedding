teens fundraisers benefit communities and the businesses that join the effort small businesses can enjoy a higher profile and a positive connection with a community cause for the effort to be successful smallbusiness owners need to create an environment that encourages all employees to participate and work toward the fundraising goal this requires regular communications defined goals and rewards for meeting or exceeding expectations a strong fundraising strategy also encourages employees to proactively participate in future fundraising events with the company  gather your employees for a meeting to explain the purpose of the fundraiser and the reason why your company has chosen to participate the likelihood of employee participation drops if you give a vague or unclear explanation for the fundraiser a clear explanation gives purpose to the effort everyone has to give and the meeting demonstrates that the fundraiser is important to the company  outline ascertainable goals to your employees such as a moneyraising goal all goals give employees a yardstick by which to measure their own performance without a goal employees cannot tell whether or not their performance meets expectations use visuals such as graphs to illustrate your companys progress toward the goal  ask employees if they have any special skills that you can use to aid the fundraising effort using an employees specialized skill can help the company reach its goals more efficiently and make employees feel essential to the effort this in turn motivates participating employees to work even harder you can also create specific ways for employees to participate and offer these options employees can then choose the option that best fits their talents and schedules  send regular emails weekly or biweekly for example with updates on your companys performance this tells employees whether or not they have met expectations or are falling behind use a positive and supportive tone in these updates so employees can also remain positive you can share the same information by updating graphs or other visuals that convey how much further the company must go to reach its fundraising goals  reward employees for reaching fundraising goals rewards can include gift certificates prizes or anything else within the companys budget the rewards not only foster positive attitude but also create healthy competition among employees things needed computer graphs prizes tip keep all communications with employees simple and clear this avoids any confusion in your messaging confusion vagueness or a

wyoming llc home  articles  how limited is limited liability how limited is limited liability one of the key advantages of a limited liability company llc over a sole proprietorship or general partnership is the fact that the owners members of the llc are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business normally that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier lender landlord or other creditor that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the llc the members may lose their entire investment in the business but their other assets  car home and personal bank accounts  are safe from the creditors of the business or are they in truth there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability many llc members will find that due to the way the business was operated the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful how personal liability arises a member of an llc can be held personally liable for many different types of claims but they typically arise under four different scenarios claims arising out of an act or omission by the member such as the members own negligence fraud or illegal act claims arising out of a contract particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member claims based on the concept of piercing the veil of the llc liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the llcs operating agreement or the applicable llc statute these claims are not a result of choosing an llc as a form of entity all of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and in fact the exceptions were developed first under corporate law actions of a member every member who actively participates in the business of the llc runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability this is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service if you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone your llc is not going to protect you similarly if you make promises about your product or service that are not true the first claim may be against the llc for breach of contract but if the llc cannot perform or pay damages the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action even if you have an employee who committed the action you may not be out of the woods if you personally hired the employee the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee a special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an llc is failure to pay payroll taxes to the irs to protect these socalled trust fund taxes any person who had the ability to prevent the nonpayment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes the irs applies this provision broadly so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didnt you are probably liable claims based on contract another and probably more common source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability usually by means of a personal guarantee for many small businesses particularly new businesses with no credit history obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible landlords too often insist on a personal guarantee particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as buildouts that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit especially after the business is up and running getting payment terms out of the gate however often requires a personal guarantee even when the creditor isnt seeking a personal guarantee a member of the llc can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role if she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the llc it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the llc full name and should indicate the role of the person who is signing member or manager piercing the veil of the llc even if a member avoids personal guarantees he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as piercing the corporate veil although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice in almost all cases of piercing the veil there is either commingling or diversion of assets some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include inadequate capitalization failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities nonpayment of dividends insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time nonfunctioning of other officers or directors absence of corporate records commingling of funds diversion of assets failure to maintain arms length relationships among related entities whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders a possible benefit of an llc over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities and absence of corporate records have no real counterparts in an llc however as case law develops the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors distributions in violation of law or agreement llc acts typically prohibit an llc from making certain distributions for example the final draft of the revised uniform limited liability company act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution  the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability companys activities or  the companys total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if the company were to be dissolved wound up and terminated at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution winding up and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution a member of a membermanaged limited liability company or manager of a managermanaged limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions in addition a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper is limited liability an illusion although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule the llc offers excellent protection from many types of liabilities for example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud the llc should shield you from personal liability if you sell a product that without your knowledge or fault is defective you should not have personal liability trade creditors who deal with the llc without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment shoring up limited liability there are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the llc business insurance carrying adequate business insurance wont change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence but it can help by providing a source for payment you might also consider a personal umbrella policy avoid personal guarantees not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee in many cases landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided learn to question the request capitalize the business adequately provide adequate capital for the entitys intended purposes and document the capital infusion keep the llc separate from your personal business no matter how small the business is it should have its own bank account dont pay personal expenses from the business account instead write yourself a check called a draw on the llc account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses likewise dont use personal checks to pay llc bills if the llc needs funds make a capital contribution or loan and account for everything act ethically dont attempt to mislead the llcs creditors about the financial condition of the business do not divert assets if the business looks like it is going down dont attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the llc that will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets if you act responsibly and take a few precautions the limited liability of the llc

document and determination letter if applicable are up to date what follows is a list of some of the more important retirement plan requirements to help employers in implementing practices procedures and internal controls to monitor plan operations your plan may have other operational requirements that need to be monitored  note that problems often arise from changes in personnel procedures payroll systems or new service providers such as accountants attorneys actuaries or thirdparty plan administrators employers that have experienced any of these changes should give special scrutiny to operational requirements affected by the change if you find you haven’t operated your plan according to the law or the plan language use our fixit guides for k plans b plans sarsep plans sepira plans

consent for distribution requirement joint and survivor annuity requirements direct rollover requirements assignment or alienation prohibition nondiscrimination requirements coverage requirements a participation requirement funding requirements exclusive benefit requirement reporting and disclosure   does your plan document satisfy the minimum participation requirements of section a check that all appropriate employees began participation on the correct date in accordance with section a and the plan document   section a of the internal revenue code code sets forth the minimum age and service requirements for a qualified retirement plan  in general a plan cannot require as a condition of participation that an employee complete a period of service with the employer extending beyond the later of the date on which the employee attains age  or the date on which the employee completes one year of service section a sets forth the rules for plan entry dates the dates when an eligible employee must begin participation  under code section a a plan is not qualified unless it provides that an employee who is otherwise eligible to participate under the terms of the plan commences participation no later than the earlier of the first day of the first plan year beginning after the date on which the employee satisfied the code section a minimum age and service requirements or the date  months after the date on which the employee satisfied the minimum age and service requirements return to list of requirements   in operation did you include in the plan all the employees described in the plan document  did you give them the benefits described in the plan   your plan document describes who is covered under your plan ie who benefits under your plan and what contributions or benefits will be provided to those covered employees your employees’ rights to contributions and benefits are derived from the plan document you must operate your plan strictly in accordance with the terms of your plan document that is you must cover the employees that your plan document describes as being covered and when the plan document says they should be covered and you must provide them the contributions or benefits set out in the plan document even if the terms of your plan do not reflect your intent you must follow the terms of your plan of course the terms of your plan may be amended by a plan amendment  but see item  below with respect to the prohibition against cutting back benefits that your employees have already accrued or to which they are already entitled under the plan   return to list of requirements   if the plan has been amended did the amendment result in a cutback of accrued benefits prohibited by section d make sure that no plan amendment reduced any participants benefit accrued before the amendment   section d prohibits the reduction of any participant’s accrued benefit by an amendment of the plan in a defined contribution plan a k profitsharing money purchase plan etc this means that no employee’s account can be reduced because of a plan amendment a plan amendment that has the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirementtype subsidy or eliminating an optional form of benefit with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment will be treated as reducing accrued benefits   return to list of requirements     if your plan is a k plan or contains a k cash or deferred arrangement coda does it comply with the requirements of k check that your k plan complies with section k including the actual deferral percentage test and the distribution requirements   under a coda participants may elect to have their employer contribute a specific amount to the plan in lieu of receiving it in cash as wages in order to satisfy the requirements of section k the plan must satisfy the actual deferral percentage adp test the adp test requires that the deferral of income into the coda by highly compensated employees be proportional to that for nonhighly compensated employees generally amounts that the participant elects to defer may only be distributed upon specific events including death disability termination of employment hardship and attainment of age  ½ the plan document must state that the actual deferral percentage adp test of code section k will be satisfied and must actually satisfy the test in operation additionally the law has changed to allow an employer not to perform an adp test if it makes a safe harbor contribution to the plan on behalf of employees in addition to the safe harbor contribution certain notice requirements are also applicable   return to list of requirements   if your plan permits employee andor matching contributions does it satisfy the nondiscrimination test for matching and employee contributions under code section m determine that your plan satisfied the actual contribution percentage test each year   if a retirement plan permits employee andor matching contributions the plan must satisfy the requirements of code section m the plan document must state that the actual contribution percentage acp test of code section m will be satisfied and must actually satisfy the test in operation the acp test requires that the employee and matching contributions provided for highly compensated employees be proportional to those for nonhighly compensated employees code section m does not apply to a defined benefit plan unless employee contributions to the plan are allocated to a separate account   similar to the adp safe harbor contribution a safe harbor exists for the acp test if the adp safe harbor contribution is made and timely notice is provided to participants additionally the level of matching contributions is limited in order for the acp safe harbor to apply   return to list of requirements   if your plan provides for elective deferrals does it limit those deferrals to the section g limit check that in operation elective deferrals made for each employee are limited to the section g limit   elective deferrals are amounts that employees elect to contribute to a retirement plan out of their compensation a plan that provides for elective deferrals for example a k plan must provide that for each participant the amount of elective deferrals under the plan and all other plans contracts or arrangements of an employer maintaining the plan may not exceed the amount of the limitation in effect under code section g code section a in addition to the plan terms providing that elective deferrals must satisfy the requirements of code section g elective deferrals must satisfy these requirements in operation this limit is  in   and  subject to costofliving adjustments in later years   the law allows participants who are age  and over to make additional elective deferrals to the plan over the statutory limit for taxable years beginning in   and  the additional elective deferrals is  subject to costofliving adjustments in later years   return to list of requirements   did your plan limit contributions or benefits so they do not exceed the limitation set forth in section  check to make sure that contributions made to any of your employees or benefits accrued by your employees if your plan is a defined benefit plan were appropriately limited by the  limitations in accordance with the plan document   the limitations on benefits and contributions for retirement plans are set forth in code section  the annual benefit limitation for a defined benefit plan is  for  and   for  subject to costofliving adjustments for later years for each employee the limitation on annual contributions to a defined contribution plan is  for  and   for  subject to costofliving adjustments for later years for each employee   return to list of requirements   was the compensation of each employee taken into account under the plan limited to the section a limitation check that for any employee only compensation up to the maximum compensation limit for the year was taken into account under the plan for purposes of computing the employees contributions and benefits   the maximum annual compensation of each employee that can be taken into account under a plan for any year must not exceed  for  and   for  and subject to costofliving adjustments in later years   return to list of requirements   does the plan comply with the topheavy requirements of section  check that your plan’s topheavy status is being determined and that if the plan is topheavy appropriate minimum vesting and contributions or benefits are being provided   a plan must satisfy certain vesting and minimum benefit requirements if the plan is topheavy in general a plan is topheavy if  percent of the aggregate accrued benefits or account balances under the plan are for the benefit of certain key employees  generally a key employee is a  percent owner of the employer a  percent owner of the employer with over  in compensation from the employer or an officer of the employer with over  in  and   in  and subject to costofliving adjustments in later years in compensation from the employer return to list of requirements   did your plan satisfy the minimum vesting requirements check that any distributions from your plan were computed by applying the vesting schedule in the plan
