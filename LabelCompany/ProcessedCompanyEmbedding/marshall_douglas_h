flaw that may be a nogo for some june   kersi quality  value  meets expectations  an exceptional bible dictionary that has loads of information beautifully written and very useful the one flaw i detect is that the font size is quite small  or  however the small font size is offset by a nice dark and clear print which makes reading a tad easier for those of us in the evening of our lives i find that after about an hour of reading i am done even if i use a page magnifier i understand that a larger font would have added to the cost i would recommend this dictionary in a heartbeat with a caveat about the font size which could be a big deal for some thank you ivp press for another great product this is a superb was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate vern
