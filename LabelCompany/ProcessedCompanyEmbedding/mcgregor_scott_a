coinventor of prescient agents and web conferencing entrepreneur and educator he is also founding member of the association for software design and world wide institute of software architects and a past president of their silicon valley chapters contents  education  plays  software and internet product designer  entrepreneurship innovation and new product design strategy  new product disruptive innovation strategist  educator  influences  see also  references  external links educationedit mcgregor has a ba in philosophy from haverford college  and a ms in industrial administration from the tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university  between  and  mcgregor received additional graduate level education in computer science at stanford university playsedit in  mcgregor wrote and produced two one act plays eggs and subplots in haverford pennsylvania and at bryn mawr pennsylvania the two one act plays were subsequently produced a second time in in pittsburgh pa after the successful debut of his musical comedy kije kije the outline for the play kije was first written up in  after the author suffered a bad case of the flu and had a fever induced dream inspired by a one paragraph description of the russian movie lieutenant kijé film on a record jacket for orchestra suite of the same name by prokofiev but the author did not begin to actively work on developing the full script until the fall of  while he was attending cmu at cmu he met collaborators arthur t benjamin lyricist and arthur darrell turner composer mcgregor transformed his earlier outline into the book for the full length musical comedy which the three submitted to an annual playwriting contest the play won and was produced in the spring of  in pittsburgh pennsylvania in addition to playwriting mcgregor has created several other less well known works of fiction including short stories and poetry as well as technical nonfiction software and internet product designeredit mcgregor has had a long career as a software developer product strategist and technologist with a broad range of inventions and applications in numerous industries and with several companies and startups he has founded several companies and held senior management roles as ceo coo cto chief product strategist vp of engineering and vp of product development early career in  mcgregor first began programming as an independent study project while a junior at darien high school this work and another independent study project he did on building a ruby laser led to his appearing on the cover of connecticut education magazine and to his receiving an all expenses paid scholarship for a summer of independent study in the sciences sponsored by yale university in the summer of  through the auspices of this program mcgregor did research in game theory and in learning theory including study of a number of computer chess programs including fox and coko supported by advisors monty newborn columbia university and ken thompson bell labs respectively in  mcgregor began working at the hewlettpackard company in palo alto california and later at their information software operation in cupertino ca in – he designed a new product known as prescient agents which facilitated both individual and team software development also over this time mcgregor began creating the swift design method for the creation of high technology disruptive innovative products prescient agents in – articles on the prescient agents software were published in the hp journal and as a cover article in the initial volume volume  of the x resource journal published by oreilly  associates entitled prescient agents a radar oreilly for your desktop through this latter publication mcgregors work came to the attention of editor david flack who in the may  edition of unixworld published an editorial entitled smarter programming bring smarter computers that recognized mcgregor for his work on more usable software and in particular singling out his work on prescient agents the prescient agents software work was notable as a very early example of software combining intelligent agents bayesian learning techniques groupware window systems and hyperlink software to improve the usability of computers in environments with many related frequently changing documents shared by many people its initial deployment was in service of distributed parallel software development at hewlettpackard merge right that same month mcgregor released an innovative new way to compare and merge branches of software developed in parallel through a product known initially as merge ahead and in subsequent releases as merge right this product received a cover notice in sun world that month along with a review from new product reviews editor david a taylor praising the products remarkable ease of learning and ease of use an unusual characteristic of this merge tool was its use of colored backgrounds and video gamelike colormatching strategies for hinting which branch to accept when merging code conflicts what was innovative about this approach was that other tools had used symbolic coding or colorcoding of text which put additional cognitive load on the symbolic and linear processing centers of the brain whereas the color matching utilized graphical and parallel processing centers the result verified by product reviewers was a reduction in undetected user errors during the merge task and an improvement in task performance times swift design method also in may  the practical programmer column in communications of the acm described elements of mcgregors swift design method process that improved the ease of learning and ease of use of software created with this process as well as reducing internal complexity time to develop and post release quality defects reported in a section entitled design from a dramatic perspective the article describes how the method builds upon many techniques commonly used in the writing of dramatic plays which mcgregor had mastered through his work as a playwright web conferencing in – while at teknowledge mcgregor designed the briefing associate for darpa and the ecommerceoriented sales associate—some of the earliest ai and browserbased systems to be designed for use over the fledgling world wide web the briefing associate was designed to enable delivery of presentations over the web and is notable as a precursor to web conferencing which mcgregor subsequently contributed to creating in  when at placeware as product manager and experience designer he helped restructure a collaborative tools software development kit sdk created at xerox palo alto research center parc into the placeware web conferencing center pioneering this new market the company was subsequently acquired by microsoft in  and the product was renamed microsoft live meeting bayesian networks and predictive analytics in  mcgregor joined data digest where he led the engineering team developing of an bayesian network predictive analytic engine which analyzed arbitrary databases or tables of transactional data to find hidden predictive relationships initially named business navigator  bn the product was later sold to decisionq corporation who renamed it fasteranalytics the analytic engine is general purpose and was initially used to for analyze data for a wide range of problems from predicting response levels to offers for a mail order record and video club to predicting proteinfolding in drug discovery research it is notable that with this work mcgregor returned to the roots of his earlier prescient agent work of a decade earlier which also relied on bayesian prediction however a decade of computer performance improvements now made technology that had once challenged  workstations well within the capabilities of desktop office machines streaming video at seeitfirst in  mcgregor returned to conferencing applications and led the team developing seeitfirst live a realtime streaming video technology which enabled synchronization of high resolution jpg images with individual frames of compressed video suitable for use even over low speed communications lines using such technology remote diagnosis that combined the motion detection of video with high precision photographs became possible software authoring technology for nonprogrammers in  mcgregor headed up a newly formed innovation lab set up by intuits consumer tax group to develop a new descriptive programming excellike technology to enable tax accountants to quickly become skilled in authoring intuits annual federal and state tax products without the long learning curve that existed with its previous procedural programming pascallike language digital photo editing in  mcgregor became coo of light crafts inc a maker of digital photo editing products in that role he achieved new growth in the existing lightzone product line aimed at professionals and serious amateurs and initiated the development of the aurora photo editor aimed at point and shoot consumers who wanted to share images via social networks web and mobile advertising and payments in  mcgregor founded xooxoox invented a new form of web advertising in which the user can choose product searches that they would like appear in the dedicated ad space of ad supported web pages they visited allowing the user to choose the ads they saw instead of having the ad network predict what would interest them based on cookies etc in  he turned his attention to mobile apps that combines instore product price comparison with realtime special offers that respond to current competitive prices and with a mobile device based payment system and founded the mobillions open source project and the purchasetime network company to commercialize the work point of sale d custom manufacturing in  mcgregor became interested in recent advances in d scanning and d printing additive manufacturing technologies and the possibility of using them to manufacture custom fit products in stores articles in popular magazines such as the economist predict that this will be a third industrial revolution while many d printing proponents have predicted these advances would transform commerce for years these technologies have yet to reach stores partly due to the lengthy print times to manufacture large objects in  mcgregor cofounded soundfit to apply these emerging d manufacturing technologies to the making of custom fit earpieces for music and communications headsets in stores because of their small size soundfit believes these items can be produced on demand in stores in under an hour and that its technologies can thus pioneer the introduction of these on demand technologies to point of sales locations entrepreneurship innovation and new product design strategyedit mcgregors first entrepreneurial experience came early in his life when in  when he became the number  employee at financial computer systems in stamford connecticut two years later he founded his own venture graphic magic a graphic design and printing firm in haverford pennsylvania prescient software mcgregors next entrepreneurial venture came as a result of his work on merge ahead at atherton technologies this work resulted in the division he had been heading being spun out as an independent firm named prescient software which continued development of the merge application as merge right this software was licensed for several years by bell labs for use with its sablime software configuration management system and ultimately the software was made available for open source use through source forge entrepreneur of the year award in  largely because of his  major contributions recognized that year unixworld editor david flack selected mcgregor as entrepreneur of the year at the annual silicon valley association of startup entrepreneurs svase year end meeting new product disruptive innovation strategistedit swift design group initially prescient software also provided innovation and new product design and new product strategy consulting based on the swift method when prescient software released mergeright as open source and wound down its software sales side the remaining consulting business was renamed the swift design group this consulting practice grew to also include interim and parttime executive management service to several early stage silicon valley startups and led to early employee or founder roles at several of these companies including data digest predictive analytics seeitfirst streaming video mobile anywhere wired wifi and cellular mobile device network management immunet distributed network security light crafts distributed photography and xooxoox web advertising educatoredit in addition to consulting on innovation strategy mcgregor has also been an educator having taught the elements of the swift design method for disruptive innovation new product design and innovative new product strategy through several professional organizations major universities and at corporations including hewlettpackard sybase and intuit these professional organizations include the association for software design and worldwide institute of software architects both of which mcgregor was a founding member of and where he has served as president of their silicon valley chapters he has also taught courses on this method through the university of california at berkeley the university of california at santa cruz and the university of phoenix  online campus influencesedit in addition to the early influence of advisors monty newborn and ken thompson mcgregor has been influenced by many other industry luminaries many of the techniques used in the swift design method can be traced to scotts work and professional activities with several other notable product designers usability consultants market consultants authors and editors among these the most notable influences include jef raskin the humane interface geoffrey moore crossing the chasm inside the tornado and gorilla game clayton christensen the innovators dilemma the innovators solution and seeing whats next donald norman the design of everyday things and things that make us smart and alan cooper about face and the inmates are running the asylum mcgregor authored an online training
