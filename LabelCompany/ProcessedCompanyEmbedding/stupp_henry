stupp henry stupp good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today ill start with an overview of our acquisition of hitec sports international holdings a global leader in the footwear market which we announced last week and are pleased to confirm we closed yesterday december  jason will then briefly walk you through our fiscal third quarter financial results and outlook for  and fiscal  and then ill provide further detail about the operational highlights for our brands including retailer and wholesaler updates before turning it over to qa so ill start with hitec hitec sports international maintains distribution across multiple retail channels and manages a diverse portfolio of high equity brands including its namesake hitec brand in addition to magnum peaks and its interceptor brand currently hitec products are sold predominately under the hitec and magnum brands in over  countries throughout the united kingdom continental europe united states canada south and central america and asia and are distributed through major retailers independent distributors licensees and direct to consumer by ecommerce in their own dot com platform in  hitecs brand generated an estimated  million in worldwide wholesale sales cherokee global brands has established a solid track record of identifying brands with strong growth potential and we are excited and confident in our strategic decision to acquire this high equity brand portfolio and i am very pleased to share a few details with you about the value that the hitec magnum peaks and interceptor brands brings to our portfolio hitec immediately enhances our leadership in key categories including footwear apparel accessories and outdoor products while driving longterm growth and creating new revenue streams in numerous markets upon closing we immediately transitioned hitec from a wholesale business to a branded licensing model while maintaining our global distribution partnerships which will eliminate our inventory and manufacturing risk while accelerating expansion opportunities into new markets and new product categories we have already executed license agreements for the core hitec magnum and related brands for the footwear category that will strengthen and expand our presence in united kingdom continental europe united states canada and africa with significant experienced growthoriented wholesale operating partner licensees in addition we have entered a master license agreement for the united kingdom and select countries in continental europe for apparel and accessories these new licensees join our existing licensees for other european countries and separate license agreements for the interceptor brand which is sold exclusively at walmart us and other territories including africa our existing platform of relationships and capabilities is key to our growth strategy as we intend to secure additional wholesale distribution and retail licensing partners for the hitec brands that allows to quickly expand into new categories and into new markets working in tandem with hitecs exceptional senior management team the sales marketing and licensing integration process has been initiated and we currently estimate that it will take approximately  to  months to complete throughout the integration process we will work alongside the hitec team and our new operating partner licensees to ensure a seamless transition at retail hitecs existing people and processes will remain largely in place and existing hitec customers and distributors should experience no disruption to their business in addition we shall maintain existing distribution agreements for the core brands throughout the globe including south and central america the middle east and asia in total hitec expands a global retail base to over  countries and offers additional strategic wholesale and retail relationships that present attractive crossselling opportunities between our existing brands such as cherokee and tony hawk with the hitec brand portfolios including rapid expansion into new categories and distribution channels hitecs portfolio of high equity brands synergizes perfectly with our existing portfolio while allowing us to further build our presence in the active outdoor markets currently hitecs core footwear portfolio is predominately sold in the athletic active and outdoor retail space through new licensing partnerships we will be able to efficiently expand hitecs brands into additional categories including apparel accessories wearables outdoor products and more beyond our licensee efforts our º capabilities platform is a powerful brand accelerator and a key differentiator that enables our licensing partners to expand wholesale retail relationships and enter markets more quickly than ever before we are excited about deploying these resources behind new growth opportunities with hitecs brands to ensure that they realize their full global potential our combined strengths will position cherokee global brands to further expand our vision agility and scale across the globe and in multiple channels categories and formats platform and portfolio synergies are central to all of our acquisitions and hitec will support both in very powerful ways so these are just a few initial highlights of the great things we are looking forward to through this important acquisition and we know there will be many more to come in a minute jason will review the economics of the transaction in greater detail including the international tax advantages associated with our new netherlandsbased operations but ill highlight the favorable economics we expect hitec will contribute approximately  million of revenue and  million of adjusted ebitda respectively in the first full fiscal year postacquisition as detailed in the press release the transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand debt equity and proceeds received from the sale of assets and prepayment of minimum royalty guarantees maintaining a healthy relatively unlevered balance sheet and a healthy capital structure is of utmost importance to cherokee global brands and we believe we funded the transaction in accordance with these objectives through the equity offering we not only grew our relationships with several of our existing shareholders we also diversified our shareholder base enabled us to accomplish another important objective and that is increasing shareholder liquidity as a result of the transaction we have provided updated annual guidance for fiscal year  for our existing business and fiscal year  for the combined cherokee global brands and hitec businesses jason will cover our outlook in greater detail momentarily its worth emphasizing that posthitec cherokee global brands will be more diversified than ever before across geographies retailers brands and product categories performance in fiscal  will be more balanced across each of these facets and we expect to see strong contributions from both our organic and acquired growth initiatives including hitec over the last five years we have grown from approximately  countries to over  from approximately  doors to over  plus of course an everexpanding ecommerce business as is evident we are excited about the future of cherokee global brands ill be back to talk about our brand performance in greater detail but first ill turn the call over to jason to discuss our fiscal  third quarter financial results in greater detail jason jason boling thank you henry and good morning everyone ill start todays discussion with a recap of our third quarter and nine month financial results followed by a review with the financial impacts of the hitec acquisition i will then elaborate on our recently issued outlook for fiscal  and fiscal  turning to our results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal  gaap revenues for the third quarter were  million compared with  million in the prioryear period this decrease is largely due to the expected decrease in north america revenues relating to the cherokee brand as we continue to transition away from target and to our new wholesale licensees during the quarter some of the decrease was offset by revenue increases globally particularly in south america india the middle east south africa and asia as the demand for cherokee brand products continues to grow we recognized an additional  of revenues over prior years quarter relating to the acquisition of the franchise flip flop shops during the third fiscal quarter we also recognized revenue from the launch of our tony hawk signature collection at walmart canada for the ninemonth period of fiscal  gaap revenues were  million compared to  million in the prior year period revenues were not materially affected by devaluations in foreign currencies cherokeebrand royalties earned by target during the ninemonth period were  million a decrease of  million over the same prior year period with an annual minimum guarantee of  million we expect the balance of  million will be recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal  furthermore we anticipate that we will also begin to record our first revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  from our new wholesale license agreements with domestic licensees for cherokee branded products with deliveries to retailers occurring during the last portion of the fourth quarter and product sales commencing in early fiscal  gaap selling general and administrative expenses were  million compared to  million in the prioryear period the increase in sga was primarily related to an increase in professional fees from legal and due diligence expenses associated with the hitec acquisition our q filing which will be filed later today includes details relating to these expenses sga expenses for the ninemonth period totaled  million compared with  million in the prior year period as weve noted throughout fiscal year our sga expenses have been elevated relative to historical periods as a result of our increased business development activities while we expect to see reduced business development expenses starting next year following the closing of the hitec acquisition from the fourth fiscal quarter we do expect increased integration costs throughout fiscal  as henry noted we expect the sales marketing and licensing integration to take between  to  months to complete with no disruption to our customers and distributors nongaap sga which excludes the aforementioned legal and professional due diligence fees totaled  million for the third quarter this compares to  million in the prioryear period for the ninemonth period nongaap sga totaled  million compared to  million in the prioryear period for the third quarter gaap operating loss was  million compared to operating income of  million in the prioryear period operating income for the ninemonth period totaled  million compared with  million in the prior year period nongaap operating income excluding the aforementioned fees totaled  million for the third quarter of fiscal  this compares to  million in the prior year period for the nine month period nongaap operating income totaled  million compared to  million in the prior year period gaap net loss totaled  or a loss of  per diluted share compared to gaap net income of  million or  per diluted share in the prioryear period for the ninemonth period gaap net income totaled  million or  per diluted share this compares to  million or  per diluted share in the prioryear period excluding the legal and professional due diligence fees nongaap net income totaled  or  per diluted share this compares to  million or  per diluted share in the prioryear period for the ninemonth period nongaap net income totaled  million or  per diluted share this compares to  million or  per diluted share in the prioryear period nongaap ebitda for the third quarter totaled  million as compared to  million in the prior year period for the ninemonth period nongaap ebitda totaled  million from  million in the prioryear period we recorded a tax benefit of  in the third quarter this compares to a tax provision of  or an effective tax rate of  in the prioryear period at october   our cash and cash equivalents were  million compared to  million at january   net debt for the quarter was  million and our leverage ratio was  times for the trailing  month period cash flow from operations for the ninemonth period was  million compared to  million in the prioryear period ill now turn to the hitec acquisition as henry mentioned earlier subsequent to quarter end we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all issued and outstanding share capital of hitec sports international holdings for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately  million on a cash free debtfree basis based upon normalized working capital upon closing of the transaction which occurred on december  we have sold substantially all the operating assets related to the hitecs wholesale operations to new operating and licensing partners with the proceeds of approximately  million funding a portion of the hitec acquisition purchase price net of these proceeds and other postclosing adjustments of  million we expect that the value paid for the hitec intellectual property assets to be approximately  million we are performing the full accounting valuation work necessary to appropriately value the hitec intellectual property assets in relation to authoritative accounting guidance and expect to provide that information with our next k filing we estimate sales and adjusted ebitda from hitec in the first full fiscal year of approximately  million and  million respectively which translates to an acquisition multiple of approximately  times revenue and  times ebitda using estimated value of the it purchased above in addition our new hitec licensing partners have  million in annual minimum guaranteed royalties each year for the first five years post acquisition which equates to over  million we have funded the purchase of the hitec acquisition through cash on hand proceeds from the sale of assets the prepayment of the first year of guaranteed minimum royalties under license agreements with certain operating partners and distributors of hitec net proceeds of a public offering of the companys common stock proceeds from a new credit facility with cerberus and proceeds from a receivables funding loan extended by one of the companys directors each of which is described more fully in the form q which will be filed later today importantly hitec builds upon our track record of highly strategic and disciplined acquisitions historically we have avoided high levered deals at unattractive multiples and hitec is no different post transaction we are pleased with our capital structure we evaluated many different financing alternatives and decided to keep our debt to ebitda ratio low while also increasing our liquidity importantly we believe we have the financial flexibility and cash flow to continue to invest in our growth initiatives from a strategic perspective we furthered our goal of diversifying our revenue streams across product categories points of distribution and geographies now lets discuss our guidance for the fiscal  year it is important to note that the guidance does not include any potential impact of the hitec acquisition for the remainder of this fiscal year or the additional shares issued relating to the equity raise in addition these measures of the ebitda and eps are presented on a nongaap basis as they exclude any transaction and integration costs associated with the hitec acquisition as outlined in our earnings release we are currently expecting the following for fiscal  revenues are anticipated to be approximately  million nongaap ebitda is approximately  is anticipated to be approximately  million nongaap eps is anticipated to be approximately  reflecting our fullyear  revenue guidance is organic growth in our tony hawk brand increased international licensing revenues for the cherokee brand and the revenue contribution from flip flop shops which we are expected to be offset by the anticipated decline in royalty revenues from the cherokee brand as we transition to our us wholesale partners as outlined previously our fiscal  guidance reflects the recognition of annual minimum guarantees from target which equates to a yearoveryear decline of approximately  million turning our attention now to fiscal  it is important to note that the guidance does include the impact of the hitec acquisition for this fiscal year once again the measure of ebit da is presented on a nongaap basis as they exclude any transaction and integration costs associated with the hitec acquisition with that said we currently expect the following for fiscal  revenues are anticipated to be in the range of  million to  million nongaap ebitda is anticipated to be in the range of  million to  million as highlighted hitec is expected to contribute approximately  million in revenue and  million in adjusted ebit da for the first full fiscal year post close we also believe there will be a significant tax benefit to having the licensing business headquartered in the netherlands with the statutory corporate tax rate of approximately  this should reduce our consolidated effective tax rate going forward also reducing tax rate we have acquired as part of the transaction approximately  million of netherlands tax benefits relating to the amortization of intangibles previously transferred to the netherlands as such we expect a consolidated effective tax rate in the mids we have historically discussed transitioning to an international tax structure and have found setting this structure out to be costlier than the immediate benefits but with this acquisition we are wellpositioned to transition from existing some ip rights to the netherlands to further benefit from lower corporate tax rates after the issuance of  million shares which includes the exercise of the underwriter option relating to our secondary offering we now have  shares outstanding thank you for your time i will now turn the call back over to henry henry stupp thank you jason last september we begin to outline our plans for the

letter of intent for master franchise agreements with australian based the product group to expand flip flop shops into two strategically important markets australia and new zealand with a focus on

growing our global points of distribution we are driving organic growth with our brands at a time when retail is moving faster as never before and operating with unprecedented complexity retailers today are having to do more than ever before but with far fewer resources they are having to make ongoing investments in technology digital supply chain upgrades even as they reinvent their brickandmortar locations they simply cannot do all the heavy listening nor do they want to and that will continue to work to our advantage now more than ever retailers need the vision agility and scale that we deliver through our high equity brands and our powerful platform of capabilities retailers count on our brand vision to bring excitement and relevance to the customers they depend on the agility of our platform to quickly seize opportunities and ramp up programs in record time and they love the scalability of our brands and how they are relevant in multiple categories how they translate globally and across innumerable digital and physical touch points in short everything we do is guided from the retailer’s point of view our mantra think like a retailer has served us well and will continue to do so as we identify and integrate new partnerships and as we expand into new channels new categories and new formats in closing were excited about the direction of cherokee global brands were confident in our strategies and believe that a global operating platform and strong portfolio of brands will drive robust topline growth in fiscal  we look forward to executing on our organic initiatives and further strategic acquisitions in order to deliver strong growth and value to our shareholders for the quarters and years to come thank you all for listening this afternoon for your continued support and with that well open up the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of dave king with roth capital partners please proceed with your question nick meyers good afternoon guys this is nick meyers on for dave king how are you doing henry stupp good good morning jason boling good morning nick meyers good morning yes first of hitec so between the various growth drivers for the brand i think it’s including international gains category expansion and growth into the domestic mass retail channel what do you see as the biggest nearterm opportunity and which of these is included in the  million of revenue you guided to jason boling well the category expansion we intend to introduce a very small capsule going into the q of fiscal  really the focus for the upcoming year is to continue to introduce the current product portfolio into new markets the cherokee global brands already services and then to ensure a successful transition to the new operating partner licensees the future of the brand especially as we move in fiscal  will be the introduction of new categories for the full family and that will include apparel accessories wearables and outdoor products that will apply not only to the hitec brand but to the other brands in the portfolio including magnum peaks and the interceptor brand which is sold at walmart in the united states and several other territories around the world nick meyers all right perfect good color thank you and then on in the  ebitda margin you guided to is below your legacy rate whats the amount of incremental investment you are expecting for hitec and do you see the margins on the business – and where do you see the margins on business going over the next couple of years jason boling yes we baked into the first year you know certain transition costs and infrastructure cost to make sure that we set the table for the future category introductions so traditionally we expect their margins to grow in the next couple of years into mids over time we do see our operating margins grow for each of our brands and thats before we calculate into the synergy opportunities with respect to having a european based operation and how we could service our partners better in europe using the leveraging facility in amsterdam and then conversely having an operation here in the united states that can help support all of our domestic licensee so we do believe that margins would grow it’s generally being our track record nick meyers all right perfect thank you all right and then lastly it sound like hitec should generates some meaningful tax advantages from keeping ip overseas i know you mentioned already but how should we be thinking about the blended tax rate for fiscal  and what are the implications for amortization jason boling yes so the blended tax rate were talking about is going to be in the mids and thats largely due to the fact that the corporate tax rate in the netherlands is a about  and then we have the ip amortization which was part of the acquisition which allows us to further reduce our effective tax rate in the netherlands nick meyers okay perfect thank you ill step back for now and good luck for the rest of the year jason boling thank you henry stupp thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jeff van sinderen with b riley and company please proceed with your question jeff van sinderen good morning and let me add my congratulations on the hitec acquisition jason boling thank you henry stupp thank you jeff jeff van sinderen look i know you guys spoke a lot in your prepared comments but just a couple of points of clarification given that youve been working on the hitec acquisition i think for a while and youve gotten to know that business a little bit maybe you can speak a little bit more about which opportunities for growth at hitec you think hold the most promise longerterm i know you spoke about getting into apparel and accessories that kind of thing maybe you can touch on that and maybe you can give us i guess your early sense of which opportunities you think are likely to bear fruit first with hitec and then any sense of that you can give us about the royalty rates for hitec if those are sort of industrystandard and if there is anything we should be aware of there that would be a good place to start thanks henry stupp all right so lets start first by talking about category expansion we have already secured a broad united kingdom continental european licensee for the apparel and accessory category well be announcing our strategic operating partner licensees early next week that company has a lot of experience with some exception wellknown brands not only for distribution throughout europe middle east and africa but is also global supplier to the world for several wellknown brands so weve already been working behind the scenes to develop the infrastructure the design direction not only for the hitec but also for the magnum brands and we will then be able to leverage that design infrastructure similar to how we work with our ° model with other licensees that weve already identified and weve initiated discussions with both domestically and internationally no surprise to us but as soon as the announcement was made we started to receive inbound calls from existing partners that we have globally and domestically but also from new largescale manufacturers who were interested in getting into this highgrowth category the active outdoor we like to say internally that walking is a new running and its very democratic and it works for the whole family so were very excited about the full family category expansion opportunities associated with it as a result of that answering your question the introduction of these new categories will naturally drive increased distribution from the footwear which is today heavily concentrated on sports specialty and specialty channel the broadening of the categories will allow us to introduce hitec footwear and the full family offering into broader retail channels and thats something that we had done the work on behindthescenes prior to the acquisition and that’s something that were most excited about from the royalty rate standpoint its very consistent with the rates that weve been working on with our cherokee brand they are you know in the  we haven’t disclosed the rates but they are in the mid to high single digit rates on a wholesale basis and we are very pleased with the  obviously significant financial support that weve garnered upfront from the new operating partner licensees that have already signed on jeff van sinderen okay good that’s really helpful and then because i know you guys have given guidance for next year anything else you can help us with as far as some of the assumptions that are baked into that for next year i guess in other words what im trying to get is a sense you know what you baked in for the legacy brands obviously there is a lot of moving parts i understand that so you may not want to speak too much about that but  and then also do you plan to give quarterly guidance or should we assume that youll pretty much be on track to give annual guidance going forward as the year unfolds and then anything you can give us on what adjustments to ebitda are baked into the hitec i know obviously you have transitional things and integration things but anything you can give us that’s baked into that  million figure thanks jason boling all right so at present we don’t plan on giving quarterly guidance we plan on giving annual guidance we plan to take the next  to  months to completely integrate the new opportunities with our existing platform and we very much look forward as a company to going back to straight gaap reporting i think historically you know that we would prefer to report in gaap numbers however listening to the street and some of our larger shareholders we felt that it was important through an acquisition cycle like the one we just concluded that we do break down the onetime costs particularly with respect to the significant costs that we incurred while we went through the integration and the acquisition of hitec in terms of the cherokee business we  at this stage weve given our high level guidance and specifically with request to the hitec business and i mentioned earlier in one of the remarks we have baked in transition costs and infrastructure build out to ensure that we set the table correctly for the future so we are comfortable with our guidance it’s the first time as you know that weve issued guidance and we will update any material changes as the year progresses jeff van sinderen okay thank for that and best of luck of holiday jason boling thank you very much jeff henry stupp thanks jeff operator thank you mr stupp – i am sorry… henry stupp yes i just want to thank everyone for their support our team is working very hard i do want to complement the exceptional management team at hitec i believe on behalf of our team at cherokee global brands the first step for us when reviewing an acquisition opportunity is to get to know the management team and our decision was driven largely by the exceptional team thats in place theres a lot of very young intelligent management that are going to bring a lot to the cherokee brand portfolio we have a lot to learn from them and we are very excited to work with ed and martin and the entire team over at hitec we couldnt be happier with the relationship that’s been forged over the last  months as we got to know each other and look very forward to a bright future on that note id like to wish

call over to cherokee’s chief executive officer henry stupp henry stupp good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us before we begin i’d like to take the opportunity to welcome carol baiocchi and susan engel both of whom joined cherokee global brands as independent directors this past february as we celebrate the global expansion of our highequity lifestyle brand portfolio carol’s track record of successfully growing consumer products and retail businesses and susans private label and brand development experience will prove invaluable we look forward to adding their extensive and diverse expertise to our board and their many future contributions in my remarks today i will start with an update on our acquisition of hitec and the entire portfolio of brands where early performance is encouraging jason with then briefly walk you through our fiscal fourth quarter and  financial results i will then provide additional brand highlights including retailer and wholesaler updates before turning it over to qa so starting with hitec i’m pleased to report that we are running slightly ahead of the sixmonth integration timeline previously communicated working closely with the hitec team and our operating partners were delivering a seamless retail transition to our branded licensing model as jason will detail further in certain territories we continue to operate through thirdparty distributors as preexisting contracts dictate the timing of conversion to our brand licensing structure we plan to convert the vast majority of distribution deals to license deals over a multiyear period postacquisition the early read from retailers and our new wholesale licensing partners and legacy distributors for our licensing model has been very positive weve executed global license agreements for the core hitec magnum and related brands for the footwear category allowing us to greatly expand our presence in the united states and canada the united kingdom and across continental europe and south africa product sales were strong and yeartodate licensing revenue for the hitec magnum and interceptor brands are in line with our expectations we’re particularly encouraged by the interest weve received among retailers seeking to expand the hitec magnum and interceptor brands into new nonfootwear categories including apparel accessories and outdoor equipment and keeping with that we are particularly pleased with the inroads our paneuropean licensee is making apparel and accessories for the hitec portfolio of brands we feel very fortunate to have partners like the batra group onboard that embody the best in class standard weve established for our licensee partnerships batra brings immense direct expertise in launching marquee brands in europe and in fact around the world and we look forward to introducing our first nonfootwear categories such as apparel and accessories to specialty and department store retailers throughout europe beginning late q of fiscal  were also pleased to announce that we are in the process of finalizing additional master licensees for the hitec magnum and interceptor brands in the us across multiple categories apparel and warm weather and cold weather accessories are in process and near final and other categories including outdoor equipment wearable electronics and essentials including hosiery underwear and base layer categories will follow we’re also hard at work expanding our product offering to our existing distribution networks in the middle east asia and latin america and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the near future hitec acquisition represents a major strategic milestone in cherokee global brands growth trajectory moreover it is a powerful example of our dual approach to acquisitions whereby we acquire both brand assets and platform capabilities in the case of hitec for example we not only gained access to multiple highequity brands but also category expertise in product development management and sales talent and an established global supply chain this approach not only brings benefits to the hitec business but also drives efficiency of scale and global expansion opportunities for all our brands across the entire cherokee global brands global enterprise this acquisition marks one of many ways in which we are aligning our vision with that of our retail partners and this too will drive greater efficiencies and scale for our business in the coming years even if the overall retailer pool does shrink as retailers increasingly look to partner as a means of enhancing their portfolios and platform capabilities we will be able to build our business by going deeper and wider without retailers across multiple consumer touch points we expected this consolidated multiplatform model to accelerate over the next few years on the retailer side and our model is uniquely suited to benefit i look forward to sharing ongoing examples of this as we move forward through hitec we also gained a strategic brand headquarters and event hub in europe under a very favorable tax structure last month we leveraged this facility to host our global brand vision summit where we showcased an immersive multibrand multicategory experience that included our newly acquired hitec magnum interceptor and  peaks brands along with a showcase for our cherokee tony hawk everyday california point cove and flip flop shop brand opportunities ill provide additional details on this exciting event later in our prepared remarks following the hitec acquisition we expect our financial performance to be more balanced across geographies retailers brands and product categories including hitec we now have  continuing licensing agreements worldwide plus distribution agreements in  countries that service over  doors plus an ever expanding ecommerce business looking ahead we will continue to explore additional scalable acquisitions that leverage and expand upon our existing platform and our portfolio of high equity brands were pleased that we maintain a leverage ratio that is amongst the lowest in the industry at approximately  times our estimated fiscal  adjusted ebitda compared to a peer group that is leveraged at a greater than  times in many cases this provides us clearly with the financial flexibility to pursue both our organic and acquisition initiatives with that ill be back to talk about our brand performance in greater detail but first im pleased to turn the call over to jason to discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and  financial results in greater detail jason boling thank you henry and good afternoon everyone ill start todays discussion with a recap of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year  financial results consolidated gaap revenues for the fourth quarter which includes the revenue from hitec were  million on a yearoveryear comparable basis cherokee global brands revenues excluding hitec was  million a decrease of  from  million in the prior year period the yearoveryear decrease of  in cherokee global brands revenue is largely due to the expected decrease in north american revenues relating to the cherokee brand as we transition from our legacy partner to our new wholesale licensees during the quarter some of the decrease was offset by revenue increases globally particularly in south america india south africa and asia as the demand for cherokee branded product continues to grow hitec revenue for the quarter was  million and is comprised of two components indirect product sales and licensed revenue indirect product sales which carry a cost of goods sold were  million and represent sales to certain distributors and government contracts all in the hitec acquisition license revenues stemming from new and existing license deals for the hitec portfolio of brands includes hitec magnum and interceptor were  million in the fourth quarter and henry noted we plan to transition our distributor agreements to territorial license agreements with the timing to be dictated by the nature of the individual contracts the remaining portion of indirect product sales that we do not expect a transition results from government contracts that are highly specialized hence falls out of the traditional scope of our licensed relationships fiscal  consolidated gaap revenues were  million and includes hitec revenues on a yearoveryear comparable basis cherokee global brands revenues were  million which compares to  million in the prior year and surpasses our guidance of  million this increase over our guidance is attributable to higher license revenues from international territories for our cherokee and tony hawk brands it bears mentioning that our guidance for fiscal  was not inclusive of hitec revenues expenses or stock dilution associated with it hitec had revenues of  million for the year and were the same as the fourth quarter given the timing of the acquisition gaap selling general and administrative expenses for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the prior year period gaap sga expenses for fiscal  totaled  million compared to  million in the prior year the yearoveryear increase for both the fourth quarter and full year reflects legal due diligence and integration expenses associated with the hitec acquisition of  million and  million respectively and includes  million in restructuring costs associated with the acquisition of hitec as weve noted throughout the fiscal year our sga expenses have been elevated relative to historical periods as a result of our increased business development activities we expect to see a reduction of the aforementioned expenses during fiscal  as we focus on growing our brands including the recently acquired hitec magnum and related brands in our portfolio nongaap sga which excludes the aforementioned legal due diligence integration and restructure costs totaled  million for the fourth quarter compares to  million in the prior year period for the full year nongaap sga totaled  million compared to  million in the prior year the majority of the increase in nongaap sga relates to the business operations for hitec for the fourth quarter and full year results for business operations related to flip flop shops for the fourth quarter gaap operating loss was  million compared to operating income of  million in the prior year period operating loss for the full year totaled  million compared with operating income of  million in the prior year nongaap operating income excluding the aforementioned costs totaled  million or  of revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal  this compares to  million or  of revenues in the prior year period full year nongaap operating income totaled  million compared to  million in the prior year adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of fiscal  was  million compared to  million in the prior year period adjusted ebitda for fiscal  was  million compared to  million in the prior year adjusted ebitda also excludes the aforementioned legal due diligence integration and restructuring costs gaap net loss for the quarter was  million or a loss of  per share compared to gaap net income of  million or  per share in the prior year period for the full year gaap net loss totaled  million a loss of  per share this compares to gaap net income of  million  per diluted share in the prior year including the legal due diligence integration and restructuring costs nongaap net income for the quarter totaled  million or  per diluted share this compares to  million or  per diluted share in the prior year for the full year nongaap net income totaled  million or  per diluted share this compares to  million or  per diluted share in the prior year we recorded a tax provision of  million in fiscal  this compares to a tax provision of  million in the prior year at january   our cash and cash equivalents were  million compared to  million at january   net debt for the quarter was  million before i turn the call over to henry i want to briefly touch on our  guidance which we issued at the time of our hitec acquisition in december we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal  as gross profit is anticipated to be in the range of  million to  million with adjusted ebitda is anticipated to be in the range of  million to  million it’s important to note that this guidance reflects full year of hitec – whole year of hitec acquisition with hitec expected to contribute approximately  million in gross profit and  million adjusted ebitda in the first fiscal year post closing the measure of ebitda is presented on a nongaap basis as it excludes the transaction integration restructuring costs associated with the acquisition thank you for your time i will now turn the call back over to henry henry stupp thanks jason i will now provide additional highlights its been widely reported that us mallbased retail continues to face challenges largely stemming from shifting buying patterns among consumers as noted previously however our platform portfolio business model and the vision agility and scale that we bring to all our partners domestically and internationally uniquely prepares us and defines our purpose as we navigate the fast evolving retail environment and to succeed despite or even because of these shift never have we been more aligned with where retail is going next as we focus on how to support our partners by thinking as they do so starting with the cherokee brand revenues for q were  million a decrease of  million over the same period last year revenues for the full year of fiscal  were  million a decrease of  this decrease was entirely due to the wind down of our relationship with target stores in the us partially offset by revenue increases as the global demand for cherokee branded products continues to grow on regional basis starting with the americas it’s a time of transition and expansion for cherokee in the us with our spring  multicategory launch now underway through our greatly expanded relationships with bestinclass licensees our most comprehensive assortment of cherokee branded products has started hitting retail shelves and ecommerce sites with national and regional retailers we are pleased that a full assortment of cherokee branded products will be available to cherokee loving consumers across the us satisfying continued strong demand in fact recent npd data confirms that cherokee brand enjoys over  domestic awareness placing it among the top  apparel brands in the us it is the strength and reputation of cherokee that has and continues to secure new distribution among leading national retailers including amongst others amazoncom walmartcom jetcom babiesrus buy buy baby and as i said other through new channels of distribution including amazon and walmartcom we are also attracting new audience and drive even greater awareness to authentic highquality and affordable family lifestyle brand while its still very early in the launch with product hitting the shelves of select retailers as we speak response among our retail partners is already very positive and we are very encouraged by initial sellthroughs and multiple reorders over the next  months we expect to aggressively grow the number of distribution points for cherokee domestically and we’ve set a target of  locations plus continued online expansion at the same time our fall and holiday launches for cherokee will be supported by a robust fully integrated marketing campaign and i look forward to providing additional details in the coming weeks i reiterate that we are confident in the prospects of the cherokee brand in the us and we’re taking a thoughtful multiyear approach to fully replacing our legacy relationship cherokee really is the jewel in our crown and its important that we secure longterm partners who are capable of helping strategically grow the business across multiple categories and channels outside of us we continue to build our dtr partnerships with retailers such as albert stores in czech republic a relationship that is generating additional product expansion and marketing opportunities across europe for the year we saw retail sales growth with nishimatsuya which was up  in japan pick n pay which was up  in south africa and a strong merger between comercial mexicana and soriana which will allow us to grow from a current  locations to over  locations in next three years in what is quite simply a very important market for us overall we continue to be very pleased with the growing consumer awareness and demand for cherokee’s iconic lifestyle products across the globe i’ll now turn to our tony hawk brand where strong brand awareness and global demand continues to fuel our expansion efforts revenues for q were  million an increase of  over the same period last year revenues for the full year fiscal  were  million an increase of  starting with the americans the performance within walmart canada has been strong and we are increasing the category offerings with the launch of our hawk girls ph program in canada later this year in the meantime our new spring collection is garnering favorable reaction and positive initial sellthroughs we are pleased that our performance in canada has led to an expansion of our business with walmart in other regions including south america and argentina us demand for hawk product is strong consumers seeking an expanded assortment of hawk product beyond what is currently available at kohls stores based on this demand and in partnership with kohls weve recently converted our agreement to a not exclusive relationship which sets the stage for an immediate expanded distribution of hawk products throughout the united states further driving expansion for tony hawk will be our new us wholesale licensee relationships which have already secured orders for an expanded distribution of hawk products hitting the floors this july were especially excited by expanding into additional distribution channels in us which include specialty retail ecommerce platforms such as amazoncom walmartcom and with additional national and regional retailers with a brand who has historically being underrepresented and in europe our recently expanded agreement with sports direct provides for broader assortment of tony hawk which will be available in their stores throughout the uk as well as online and through our partnership with fashion uk we will launch the tony hawk brand in over  ca locations this november as you know ca is the leading fashion retail business with approximately  stores in  countries worldwide along with it a growing online presence we continue to advance discussions regarding new partnership for the tony hawk brand in asia and we look forward to make an announcement on this front in the very short future i’d like to now turn to the performance of flip flop shops where we continue to drive productivity and deploy multipronged approach to grow revenue for q was  an increase of  over the same period last year revenues for the full year fiscal  were  million a yearoveryear increase of  during the year we made a strategic decision to close a handful of underperforming franchise locations in order to drive greater overall productivity and make way for innovative format launches were pleased with the overall quality of the retail portfolio and yeartodate performance where we have experienced  samestore sales growth domestically we expect future performance to continue to benefit from these and other refinements that will allow us to more efficiently scale the concept both domestically and internationally were excited to launch our first fully owned ecommerce platform flipflopshopscom late in the fourth quarter post launch traffic to the site has built steadily as should only continue to do so as we head into the important summer season currently the site is generating over  page views monthly we’re very excited to also announce the debut of flip flop shops’ first floating retail concept at the stonebriar mall just outside of dallas texas which is off to a very strong encouraging start the new floating retail concept is situated in one of the most highly trafficked common areas and incorporates many of the recognizable features of the traditional flip flop shop while offering even more compelling financial economics to our franchisee partners we have commitments from our franchisees to open additional five to eight floating stores during fiscal  and we will grow our flip flop shops footprint through other large scale franchisee partners around the world with announcements in the us and canada forthcoming on the international front and through our future master franchisee in australia and new zealand we plan to open two retail locations this fall with an additional two to three stores planned for  new distribution channels and format innovations including freestanding stores floating retail and shop in shops with specialty retailers will continue to driver our growth plans for flip flop shops at the same time we will continue to leverage the flip flop shops’ platform to expand the reach of our brand portfolio with our everyday california brand serving as a recent example everyday california just debuted in our flip flop shop locations across the us and internationally and we are exploring additional synergies between our portfolio of highequity brand and our platform turning our attention to the hitec brand portfolio revenues for q and year were  million consisting of  million in licensing revenue from our licensees and  million of indirect product sales from our distributors through our new licensing arrangement with the batra group in the uk weve been able to immediately establish a londonbased design team to design and create the multicategory product expansion opportunity for the hitec magnum  peaks and interceptor brands the batra group is a very established ukbased branded apparel and accessory supplier that services the paneuropean community with stable of bluechip brands including fila russell athletic and sergio tacchini amongst others and partnering with batra group cherokee global brands set up a global design development center for apparel and accessories to service all of our global partners in fact in a mere two months we are able to create and sample the spring and summer  apparel and accessory offering which is a fantastic example of the core capabilities that form the infrastructure associated with our forward thinking pillars and platforms in addition to the quick multicategory product expansion our new licensing partners including batra and carolina footwear have been able to expand the current distribution of the core footwear programs for the entire family in short as we transition from the old operating model to a new more agile licensing model the strength of our new licensing partners is bearing a very quick positive results on the domestic front we expect to announce our master apparel accessory and outdoor equipment licensees in the coming weeks if not sooner we have already started meeting with national and regional department stores marketleading retailers in the sports specialty channel plus every major ecommerce retailer to introduce them to the expanded hitec magnum interceptor and  peaks brand opportunities and we look forward to sharing our results in the coming weeks given the speed in which weve been able to develop the apparel and accessory ranges were announcing today that we have begun retail placement in certain key markets for our late q fiscal  program several months ahead of schedule i want to thank our licensees dearly for their incredible efforts in securing such wonderful results in these very early stages of our new relationship one other important note related to the hitec brand portfolio is the incredible performance of our interceptor brand at walmart which has recently been expanded to include walmartcom jetcom searscom and indiscernible sales have picked up significantly with unit volumes increasing from approximately  pairs per week during fiscal  to over  pairs per week thus far in fiscal  these strong results bode well for future category expansion of the interceptor brand specifically as it relates to apparel cold and warm weather accessories base layers hosiery and underwear we’re also working to globalize the interceptor with walmart into additional countries with the first expansion slated for early q of fiscal  with respect to the magnum brands our government contract business continues to build and we expect our expansion into new categories will lead to additional expansion opportunities on the retail front magnum continues to perform with increased bookings in many territories and we are hard at work preparing the autumn winter  launch of apparel warm and cold weather accessories hosiery underwear and base layers in summary were excited about our future direction through our track record of successful acquisitions and organic growth initiatives – proven organic growth initiatives we have transformed cherokee global brands into a global diversified enterprise with a vastly expanded brand portfolio and diversified multicategory product assortments for the entire family that today are operating in more than  retail locations and a growing number of digital platforms in over  countries worldwide we expect our performance in fiscal  to reflect this diversity with greater balance across geographies retailers brands and product categories and we expect to see strong contribution from both organic and acquired growth initiatives our global perspective has always been one of our greatest strengths and as i alluded to earlier we shared our vision with our valued partners at our global brand vision summit which was held this year at our new european brand headquarters in amsterdam april  through april  this years theme think outside speaks to our forward looking opportunities on multiple fronts we retrofitted the event venue to provide an immersive multibrand showcase for our growing portfolio including of course our newly acquired hitec magnum interceptor and  peaks brands in addition to name sic cherokee tony hawk everyday california point cove and flip flop shop retail concept over  retailers licensees distributors and media representatives joined us for the semiannual three day event during the summit we provided our partners a glimpse into the evolution of our capabilities platform and brand portfolio including a preview of our grand vision and a showcase of the latest in store in digital innovation attendees gained insight into shifting consumer purchasing behavior the trends in technologies that we expect will change the game in  and beyond and we presented for the first time the full spectrum of categories that will continue to support enhance our global expansion including apparel accessories footwear and home products across our company’s entire brand portfolio for spring and summer  summit embodied the spirit of collaboration that defines our global partnerships and the value we place on aligning with retailers’ future it exemplified the many reasons why this is a truly exciting time at cherokee global brands i thank you for joining us today and for your continued support and i will now open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from eric beder of wunderlich please proceed with your question eric beder good afternoon and congratulations on a strong end to the year and appreciate the commentary henry stupp thank you eric eric beder could you talk a little – so i want to have a few things one is that hitec has materially more country focus than you guys do in terms of just diversity in countries how are you going to bring – how are you looking to leverage that going forward with some of your core brands before hitec henry stupp well we had our vision summit and we leveraged it we moved up our calendar our original goal was to bring all of our partners together in june and when we looked at the calendar and we saw that hitec already had a global sales meeting planned for their licensees and distributors and the new operating partners we moved our calendar up retrofitted the brand headquarters in amsterdam and we were able to walk our partners both existing and some future partners through an entire showcase – an immersive showcase of all of our brands there is a thread that connects the brands that we bring into our portfolio so if i may use an example if we look at the global distribution for the hitec brand there is a great synergy that exists between the distribution of hitec products and the opportunity to distribute the tony hawk brand – the same retail channels same retail opportunities as a result of bringing in all of the  representatives – representative countries for hitec we were able to immediately introduce through the platform that existed with cherokee global brands new distributors and potential licensees to brands such tony hawk now not every brand has to be done through a license agreement in fact some of the existing hitec distributors are able to immediately tap in to our platform specifically our supply chain and bring brands such as tony hawk into new markets faster than ever before in the past where it could take as long as  months to  months to introduce a brand into a country we are now looking to bring it down into  days or less because we have ready to go product thats already approved from bestinclass fully compliant supply chain so weve had incredible interest our guys are already in contract with multiple countries to leverage the hitec relationships for many of our existing brands and you could also expect that our footwear opportunity will be magnified significantly across all brands in our portfolio given the design talent that exists for footwear over in amsterdam eric beder great i’m kind of switching gears here in terms of cherokee in the us so youve been out there for about four months what are kind of the takeaways you are getting and how do you see it starting to ramp as we go through the year henry stupp well we found that it was definitely a challenge at the onset moving from a legacy partner convincing new retailers to buy the cherokee brand when we still had incredible placement through significant part of q with target now that target has wound up and product has started to – retails were finding that the retail base domestically is growing more interested so thats one facet thats very positive the second is our licensee base was very carefully vetted and selected and very supportive they have built incredible product which was our first priority value driven product and in simple terms every retailer that has acquired it has performed extremely well with multiple reorders coming in and in fact some retailers coming in and buying all the stock that’s on the floor so the good news is were chasing orders now from an inventory standpoint weve set a new goal of door placement towards the end of the year our ecommerce platform has grown significantly since our last call the product is compelling indiscernible cherokee is a great brand and we have fantastic licensees who are in it for the long haul and we expect as quarter after quarter passes we will see continued growth continued success with our brand eric beder fantastic and finally tony hawk and kohls i assume you went to the nonexclusive agreement how do you think thats going to affect the overall results in terms of – we know the minimums were for kohls how do you look upon seeing that flows through and i assume when do you think that becomes a netnet positive in terms of revenues for you henry stupp well we had immediate interest from numerous retailers so we openly candidly transparently had conversations with kohls they recognize that we should not be restricted under a license agreement it’s not good for the brand we also behind the scenes prepared a free robust research survey which showed kohls that the expansion of the brand into multiple channels would only elevate the profile of tony hawk in all likelihood would increase the business at kohls the fact is is that the opportunity based on orders that are already coming in from some pretty significant scale retail partners leads us to believe that hawk will grow beyond its current sales level and there are other factors that will increase the profitability specifically the royalty rate that we get on the wholesale business is very positive and the structure of the present deal with kohls had commissions tied in to thirdparty agents when we acquired the brand from quicksilver which will go away so the netnet is it immediately becomes a more positive business every dollar generated is significantly more positive for us and the category skateboarding is hitting a tremendous growth curve so were quite excited there are some very large scale retailers that have already picked it up we will only name them – in our next quarter we will begin to name them as goods start – being planned to hit the retail shelves we do have orders secured in new merchandise for an expanded distribution will hit stores as of august  of this year this is the first time we’re publicly announcing that eric beder great congratulations good luck in  henry stupp thank you very much eric operator our next question comes from jeff van sinderen of b riley  company please proceed with your question jeff van sinderen let me add my congratulations it sounds like everything is going great henry maybe you could just walk us a little bit more through spring  obviously youre still sort of in process it sounds like with the launch just wondering where the product has the biggest presence to retail or where its going to have the biggest presence to retail talking about the cherokee brand product what categories are the broadest array of product and also whats selling through the best and then conversely are there any areas where you feel like product needs more work or you maybe need to focus more and what sort of sales volume should we be thinking about for the first half of the calendar year in that brand henry stupp so we’ve only given top line guidance in terms of sales volume with respect to the cherokee brand we have stated were looking at a  to year period to replace the revenue basis that we had it may happen quicker based on the speed in which retailers are starting to come on board with respect to the categories that are performing best the newborns infant and toddlers and the little boylittle girl business which has the widest placement thus far is performing the best there have been some lessons that we’ve learned cherokee at target was not a highlow price point so the retailers that have followed an everyday low price have set price on the brands have immediate positive returns retailers that traditionally use a highlow pricing confused the legacy cherokee customers so were able to immediately insert ourselves and fix that because we’re aware i think that the biggest future potential no surprise domestically is the dot com platform we’ve been significantly embraced by walmartcom jetcom searscom and their portfolio there plus amazoncom so the combination of that plus the marketing plan that we will be introducing as we head into the latter half of this year i think will all be significant drivers its a first for us in how were going to communicate directly with the consumer channel to support our retail partners we have a multiintegrated approach so we’ll really go in here and were pleased with the results we’re working hard i will say from a product standpoint we are very delighted with the returns and the results most importantly and we only are mentioning it today weve recently concluded our ladies license agreement with a bestinclass license partner it was a company that we had wanted to work with for quite some time and we finally came to an agreement a few weeks back theyve immediately started to secure placement as well thats very exciting for us that as the quarters and months progress we will be a full family lifestyle brand much in a way we were a decade ago so i’m very pleased we are going to take it slow and steady and were going to win this race jeff van sinderen thats great and then just maybe if we can shift over to hitec for a minute it sounds like that a little bit of a transitional thing as far as booking direct and getting the new licensees all signed up i guess is – i will look at it so thinking about that given i guess the nature of it as a stand is there anything you can give us in terms of fall order book from retailers that are buying hitec or they planning hitec up kind of where do we stand at this point in that henry stupp generally bookings are up were sticking with our guidance for right now booking are up sellthrough is up we are transitioning from an old operating model that was more inventory in hands and less prebooking to new licensees which are attacking the market frankly the way the market needs to be attacked which is more prebookings and less immediate at once delivery so our goal was to not be the last supplier because we have goods and retailer x wants to buy something they will call hitec our partners like caroline and batra are negotiating significant upfront commitments and i will tell you that carolina footwear for example has had an immediate positive impact in terms of door count here which for fall of this year which is a very positive result in early stages that combined with some pretty impressive growth that were planning with the ecommerce business is exciting if i look at my interceptor business at walmart it’s off the chart so that’s leading to new product opportunities it lead to an immediate expansion with jetcom searscom walmartcom it led to an expanded side range so well be able to service a broader consumer audience so were delighted the one thing i do want to point out also was – and it bears noting why don’t we – listening into a lot of the peer group calls a lot of the domestic fashion guys a lot of the domestic retailers the global nature of our business today is release something that we’re most proud of we frankly felt several years ago we identified that the us market was going to hit a bit of a rough patch given the fact that there is double the retail square footage per capita here than the next closest country the globalization of our brands not simply buying a brand in a foreign market and saying were global but actually taking a brand and selling it in multiple countries for us it was very important were able to sit here today despite the fact that there is some weakness in the us market and well get through it and all of us get through it were very excited about the fact that were global and thats been a very important transition and shift in our business and so i just wanted to make that one comment as well jeff van sinderen okay but just to clarify that youre still saying that the domestic order book for hitec is up correct henry stupp correct correct jeff van sinderen okay henry stupp also the retail partners have already expressed inbound interest in expanding the assortment beyond the legacy footwear business so were actually meeting with some of the larger retailers have been for several weeks now about introducing late q or q of next year a hitec magnum full assortment of products so that’s a key material plus for us jeff van sinderen okay and then can you help us understand the split between hitec direct and licensed how we should think about that for this year jason boling yeah so right now when we gave our guidance the guidance is given to you based upon the gross profit number so we didnt want to confuse anybody with breaking out the distributor sales versus licensing jeff van sinderen okay and then i didnt see a balance sheet im sure thats going to be in your filing jason boling correct jeff van sinderen but are you – can you give us a sense or maybe you already said this and i missed it but your inventory level at this point jason boling well we didn’t discuss inventory and that will be on the filing when we file it jeff van sinderen okay and when is that due jason boling well it was due a while ago jeff van sinderen right right i’m sorry but i mean given the extension that you got when do you expect to actually file it jason boling we will be filing it soon henry stupp yeah jeff van sinderen okay great thanks for taking my questions jason boling thank you henry stupp thank you very much jeff operator ladies and gentlemen we have time for one final question our final question will come from dave king of roth capital please proceed with your question dave king afternoon guys jason boling hi dave dave king unfortunately it won’t be one final question i’ve got several but i guess first off on the hitec distribution contracts it seems to me that the wholesale equivalent fees youre capturing on those are i don’t know several multiples higher than the license percentage versions i guess if you convert those can you talk about the ability to capture similar percentages there and then i guess more broadly is there a potential to grow with similar kind a high fee relationships going forward henry stupp yeah i think what were seeing dave is an evolution of the model right i think that when – cherokee which has been really – when bobby introduced the direct to retail concept it was pioneering it was innovative it was very smart it was a great reaction to how the licensing model should evolve and that really forms the foundation of what cherokee global brands is about pioneering and being innovative when we introduced the  degrees platform that was next evolution of demonstrating innovation by us taking cues back focusing on organic growth focusing on globalization of our brands and being able to deliver a clear vision more speed to all of our partners whether they are licensees wholesalers or retailers to answer your question about distributors you are again seeing a further evolution of the business were able to monetize the supply chain work and the infrastructure thats been put in place over the last few years to answer your question we do believe that there are many opportunities for us to drive higher margins as we move into the future for all of our brands as we continue to centralize and globalize our supply chain and have better product at our prices in all major markets dave king okay okay that helps it’s great color and i guess congrats on getting cherokee and hawk on the walmartcom i guess when do you expect to get cherokee to launch on the site and i guess how many categories do you expect and then i guess for hawk if we include walmartcom maybe a followup to eric’s final question if we include walmartcom but then assuming kohls maybe is lower i guess how should we be thinking about the full economics relative to i think the  million i think you’re getting on an annual basis previously henry stupp well the expansion is already underway weve already started to get commitments from multiple retailers we use walmart and amazon as examples for tony hawk and cherokee so we’ve got three licensees theyre all bestinclass partners who do significant business with all retailers we are in negotiation for some pretty sizeable commit outside of kohls which is why we believe that the guidance we provided is solid for this year and as we move into the fall we will of course issue guidance for subsequent periods so we are – we think that we are taking the necessary steps to not have our brands captive because weve certainly seen what happened in that scenario and i think that we had to take a cold hard look at our business and how difficult it was to transition from our legacy relationship particularly – specifically with the cherokee brand we are thankful that we had a platform that was able to do it we’re thankful that we have licensees who were able to swiftly pick up the ball and i think we went back and looked at where are we exposed what should we do what actions should we take right now and that lead to fruitful discussions with kohls and new wholesale partners for us to immediately expand so that we do not find ourselves in a position where we have to experience what we went through in  dave king okay that helps and then maybe on – i guess since were in early may now any color on april that you can provide at this point on the april quarter anything worse or better than expected on any fronts henry stupp were going to be reporting in a few weeks so we’ll go through everything right then and there were kind of back to back right now but were planning on reporting early june q dave king okay okay thats helps there and then i guess one more for me if i look at the nongaap tax rate it look like it was about  jason is that the right number for the quarter and then is that how we should be thinking about that on a goforward basis jason boling so the nongaap tax rate is going to be its hitec in amsterdam at  and the rest of cherokee right now at roughly  something so you would still based upon that the guidance that we gave included some benefit to the tax rate i do expect it to improve i dont expect it to be in the lows at this point dave king okay okay perfect nice quarter guys good success on a lot of fronts and good luck with the rest of this year thanks henry stupp thank you very much jason boling thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this
