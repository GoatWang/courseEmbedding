congress granted national banks the power to exercise  all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking act of june   ch  s   stat   codified at  usc s  seventh  fiftytwo years later congress enlarged that grant by conferring the power to act as general insurance agents to national banks located in towns with a population not in excess of five thousand see act of sept   ch   stat   codified at  usc s   in  congress further enlarged bank powers by allowing financial subsidiaries of well capitalized and well managed national banks to engage in a wide variety of insurance activities both as an agent and broker grammleachblileyact pub l no  ss a   stat      the officer of the comptroller of the currency comptroller or occ defendantappellant here determined

order signed march   see independent ins agents of am inc v hawke  f supp d  ddc  the comptroller appeals joined by two associations representing banking interests as amici curiae we affirm i background a history  national banks being creatures of statute possess only those powers conferred upon them by congress see texas  pac ry co v pottorff  us    first natl bank of charlotte v national exch bank of baltimore  us    the national bank act of  act of june   ch   stat  codified as amended in scattered sections of  usc as amended provides for the chartering of national banks as part of this statutory regime  usc s  seventh confers the following powers upon national banks  national banks shall have the power to exercise all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking by discounting and negotiating promissory notes drafts bills of exchange and other evidences of debt by receiving deposits by buying and selling exchange coin and bullion by loaning money on personal security and by obtaining issuing and circulating notes   usc s  seventh  the most pertinent phrase to this case is all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking the following enumeration of powers is only illustrative and the comptroller may authorize additional activities if encompassed by a reasonable interpretation s  seventh see nations bank v variable annuity life ins co  us   n  valic american ins assn v clarke  fd   dc cir   the comptrollers authority to confer all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking has been interpreted to mean powers convenient or useful in connection with the performance of one of the banks established activities pursuant to its express powersarnold tours inc v camp  fd   st cir whether a particular banking devices nomenclature harkens to traditional banking activities is not dispositive instead the powers of national banks must be construed so as to permit the use of new ways of conducting the very old business of banking mm leasing corp v seattle first national bank  fd   th cir   for example in mm leasing the ninth circuit upheld the comptrollers determination that national banks may lease personal property when the transaction is functionally identical to a secured loan see id at   similarly in american insurance association we held that national banks may offer municipal bond insurance which was actually the functional equivalent of a standby letter ofcredit a traditional banking device see  fd at   in independent bankers assn of america v heimann  fd  dc cir  we recognized the right of national banks to offer credit life insurance that product names the bank as beneficiary not the bank customer and is a principal form of security for consumer loans we noted that unlike other forms of insurance coverage  credit life insurance is a limited special type of coverage written to protect loans id at  because credit life insurance is essential where ordinary loans on personal security are involved and does not involve the operations of a general life insurance business we approved of the activity id see also first natl bank of eastern arkansas v taylor  fd  th cir  upholding authority of banks to sell debt cancellation contracts to extinguish loan debts in the event of death  even in light of the interpretations of s  seventh upheld in the above cases however when the occ has undertaken to authorize national banks to sell general forms of insurance it has run into trouble in  comptroller john skelton williams asked congress to augment the powers of national banks to offer insurance in his view national banks located in country towns and villages were in need of additional sources of revenue and should be allowed to more fully compete with state chartered banks citing §  seventh the comptroller noted a hurdle to his goal national banks are not given either expressly nor by necessary implication the power to act as agents for insurance companies to resolve this situation the comptroller asked congress to grant insurance agency power to national banks but only those located in small towns in his view it would be unwise and therefore undesirable to confer this privilege generally upon banks in large cities where the legitimate business of banking affords ample scope for the energies of trained and expert bankers  cong rec    congress acted on the comptrollers request it passed an amendment to the federal reserve act act of sept   ch   stat  codified at  usc s   which provides  in addition to the powers now vested by law in the national banking associations organized under the law of the united states any such association located and doing business in any place the population of which does not exceed five thousand inhabitants  may under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the comptroller of the currency act as the agent for any fire life or other insurance company authorized by the authorities of the state in which said bank is located to do business in said state by soliciting and selling insurance and collecting premiums on policies issued by such company   usc s  briefly put this statute authorizes only those national banks located in towns of  or less to sell insurance as an agent  in light of this statutory framework both the fifth and second circuits have rejected attempts by the comptroller to authorize all national banks to sell insurance purportedly under the authority of the incidental powers clause of §  seventh see saxon v georgia assn of indep ins agents inc  fd  th cir  american land title assn v clarke  fd  d cir  alta  in saxon the comptroller decided without further congressional authorization that  incidental to the powers vested in them under  usc section    national banks have the authority to act as agent in the issuance of insurance which is incident to banking transactions  saxon  fd at  quoting occ ruling no  the ruling was not limited to locales of less than  persons a group of insurance agents brought a declaratory judgment action asking the court to hold the comptrollers ruling unlawful on appellate review the fifth circuit held that s  seventh could not confer general insurance powers when considered in conjunction with the implications of s see id at  judge thornberrys concurrence shed light on the basic dilemma from an economic standpoint it may be unfortunate that this court is interfering with the expansion of national banks  but the banks should look to congress not the comptroller id at  thornberry j concurring specially  the scenario was similar in the second circuit alta case there the occ issued an interpretative letter in  allowing any national bank to act as agent in the general sale of title insurance see alta  fd at  relying on this interpretation the comptroller authorized a national bank to sell title insurance as agent to borrowers and lenders in connection with real estate loans made by the bank the comptroller attempted to distinguish saxon on the grounds that title insurance unlike the broader range of activities authorized in saxon was essential to a banks ability to provide financing the second circuit rejected this interpretation noting that the saxon court did not look to the nature of the insurance activity authorized see id at rather the alta court recognized that §  applies to any  insurance company and that a title insurance company is surely an insurance company id at  internal quotation marks omitted the court held that even if s  seventh could be read to encompass the general sale of title insurance s  precluded such a reading b the present controversy  the facts of this case are a rerun of those in saxon and alta though the occ is surely familiar with its past defeats it seems determined to repeat them  on december   the occ issued a letter ruling that a national bank may offer as agent multiple peril crop insurance and hailfire insurance collectively crop insurance footnotes omitted the product insures against unavoidable losses on crops including losses due to drought excess moisture insects disease flood hail wind and frost if a farmers average yield drops below the insured level the insurance company pays the difference directly to the farmer  the comptroller ruled that the sale of crop insurance was within the business of banking for three reasons  crop insurance is similar to creditrelated insurance which banks may offer and is a logical outgrowth of the banks power to make loans because it assists banks in making recovery from borrowers  crop insurance is something that benefits farmers and banks by protecting against risks and  the risks are similar to those already borne by national banks in the sale of insurance authorized under  usc s  or elsewhere the comptroller further concluded that even if the sale of crop insurance was not part of the business of banking it was incidental to that business in a footnote the agency stated that the prior circuit decisions in saxon and alta were not applicable because those decisions were only concerned with broad forms of insurance  the district court rejected the comptrollers interpretation citing saxon andalta approvingly and relying on the interpretative cannons of giving each provision of a statute meaning and expressio unius est exclusio alterius the court reasoned that s  was intended to remedy what congress saw to be the limited powers of section  seventh and thus compelled the conclusion that all national banks did not have general insurance powers iiaa  f supp d at the court rejected the suggestion that crop insurance is actually a creditrelated product like the creditlife insurance approved in heimann see id at  unlike the product in heimann payable to the bank crop insurance protects farmers and does not guarantee repayment to lenders like a traditional security device ii analysis  when interpreting the meaning of a federal statute administered by a single agency we engage in the twostep inquiry of chevron usa inc v nrdc  us   at the first step we inquire into whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue if it has we must give effect to that express intent when performing this first step we employ traditional tools of statutory construction see id at  n ins v cardozafonseca  us    if the statute before us is silent or ambiguous on the precise issue we proceed to the second step where we will defer to the agencys interpretation of the statute if it is reasonable and consistent with the statutes purpose see eg nuclear info resource serv v nuclear regulatory commn  fd   dc cir  en banc  in this case our inquiry is whether the all such incidental powers language of s  seventh includes the power of banks to sell crop insurance while the word incidental may be a poster child for ambiguity we find that it is not ambiguous in the context of general insurance activities a broad statute when passed may have a range of plausible meanings but subsequent acts can narrow those meanings where the scope of the earlier statute is broad but the subsequent statutes more specifically address the topic at hand fda v brown  williamson tobacco corp  s ct    see also ga endlich a commentary on the interpretation of statutes s   the special mention of one thing indicates that it was not intended to be covered by a general provision which would otherwise include it just so here because s  expressly grants national banks located in small towns the general power to sell insurance as agent reading s  seventh to authorize the sale of insurance by all national banks transgresses both common sense and two traditional rules of statutory interpretation the presumption against surplusage and expressio unius est exclusio alterius  a broad reading of s  seventh to allow the general sale of insurance by national banks would render at least two other related statutes meaningless in violationof the endlessly reiterated principle of statutory construction  that all words in a statute are to be assigned meaning and that nothing therein is to be construed as surplusage qizhuo v meissner  fd   dc cir  see also halverson v slater  fd   dc cir  congress cannot be presumed to do a futile thing why would congress have passed s  to confer insurance authority to some national banks if all national banks already had that power pursuant to s  seventh it would have been completely useless see alta  fd at  likewise the grammleachbliley act authorizes financial subsidiaries established by well capitalized and well managed national banks to insure  against loss harm damage illness disability or death as agent or broker pub l no  ss a listing activities that financial holding companies may engage in  authorizing financial subsidiaries of national banks to engage in some of these activities  stat    if national banks could already sell insurance under s  seventh congress would have no reason to pass a statute limiting that power to financial subsidiaries of only well capitalized and well managed national banks  in addition to the canon of avoiding surplusage expressio unius est exclusio alterius also points to the conclusion that congress did not intend for all national banks to have insurance powers under s  seventh see ethyl corp v epa  fd   dc cir  mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another thing quoting american methyl corp v epa  fd   dc cir in context because s  only confers the authority to sell insurance on banks in smaller locales and because national banks only have the powers granted to them by statute s  strongly confirms the view that the more general grant in s  seventh did not include broad insurance powers see alta  fd at  saxon  fd at   the comptroller argues that the expressio unius maxim cannot preclude an otherwise reasonable agency interpretation this is not entirely correct true we have rejected the canon in some administrative law cases but only where the logic of the maximthat the special mention of one thing indicates an intent for another thing not be included elsewheresimply did not hold up in the statutory context see texas rural legal aid inc v legal servs corp  fd   dc cir  clinchfield coal co v fmshrc  fd   dc cir  cheney rr co v icc  fd   dc cir  as we have noted if there are other reasonable explanations for an omission in a statute expressio unius may not be a useful tool see clinch field  fd at  see also carter v director office of workers compensation programs  fd   dc cir  but where the context shows that the draftsmens mention of one thing like a grant of authority does really necessarily or at least reasonably imply the preclusion of alternatives the canon is a useful aid shook v district of columbia finan responsibility and management assistance auth  fd   dc cir  see also halverson  fd at  michigan citizens for an indep press v thornburgh  fd   dc cir affd by an equally divided court  us    in this case the two canons upon which we rely inarguably compel our holding that s  seventh unambiguously does not authorize national banks to engage in the general sale of insurance as incidental to the business of banking the supreme court employed reasoning identical to ours in texas  pacific railway co v pottorff  us  there the court considered whether a national bank has the incidental power under s  seventh to pledge its assets to secure a private deposit thecourt found no evidence that such a pledge was in any way incidental to banking and furthermore reasoned that if this power was authorized there would have been no need to later alter  usc s  to provide a limited power to pledge see id at  the prechevron vintage of pottorff is irrelevant the high court had already made clear by that time that interpretations of the comptroller merit deference see first natl bank in st louis v missouri  us     even in light of the inherent ambiguity of the incidental phrase of s  seventh we nonetheless do not find that the statute is ambiguous here within the meaning of chevron to the contrary the instant case and pottorff both suggest that the cannons of avoiding surplusage and expressio unius are at their zenith when they apply in tandem cf halverson  fd at  endlich supra at s  under the first step of chevron we hold that congress has not authorized the comptroller to permit the sale of crop insurance solely under the authority of s  seventh  to the extent any ambiguity remains on the issue we conclude that the comptrollers interpretation of s  seventh is not reasonable crop insurance is a general form of property or casualty insurance protecting farmers against many potential disasters it falls squarely within the types of insurance held unauthorized in saxon and alta unlike the special creditlife product which we approved in heimann the beneficiary of crop insurance is the farmerinsured not the bank if the sale of crop insurance is incidental to banking under s  seventh there would no way of distinguishing other general forms of insurance agriculturalists undoubtedly rely on banks to obtain loans but so do other individual and corporate borrowers who may also wish to purchase property or casualty insurance to protect their interests nothing about crop insurance leads to a conclusion that it can be treated differently than other general forms of insurance under national banking laws just because its coverage is limited to farmers  the occ supports its interpretation on the grounds that the sale of crop insurance involves risks similar to those already assumed by banks would benefit customers and would be a logical outgrowth of current bank activities the comptroller cites as support for example the experience of national banks in small locales in selling all types of insurance under  usc s  however that activity is statutorily authorized while the sale of crop insurance may be a logical outgrowth that national banks could apply their prior experience to that alone cannot constitute legal authorization if it did national banks would be able to constantly expand their field of operations on an incremental basis without congressional action first would be the authority to sell crop insurance followed by whatever insurance against business risks of a bank customer is the next logical outgrowth there would be no logical stopping point section  seventh cannot bear the weight the comptroller proposes to place on it under its test the comptroller may of course authorize activities under s  seventh within reasonable bounds but todays interpretation is not within such bounds valic  us at  n iii conclusion  in the end this case may have little practical effect national banks have the power to sell insurance including crop insurance if they meet the requirements of the grammleachbliley act however they do not have the power to sell cropinsurance solely under the authority of  usc s  seventh the judgment of the district court is  affirmed notes  two other circuits have embraced the same reading of national banking statutes as saxon and alta without discussion see commissioner v morris trust  fd   th cir  a national bank is prohibited from operating an insurance department except in towns having a population of not more than  inhabitants first sec bank of utah na v commissioner  fd   th cir  citing saxon and morris trust affd  us   the supreme court has recognized this case law but has had no occasion to pass on the issue see valic  us at  commissioner v first sec bank of utah na  us     in christensen v harris county us  s ct  ledd us may   decided after oral argument in this case the supreme court held that agency interpretations voiced in opinion letters do not warrant chevronstyle deference id at  instead they are entitled to respect under skidmore v swift  co  us    but only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade  christensen at  quoting arabian american oil co  us    all parties in this case assumed that the normal chevron framework applied to the comptrollers interpretation of §  seventh contained in a letter see independent ins agents of am inc v ludwig  fd  dc cir  applying chevron step two to a comptroller letter we frame part of our analysis in terms of whether the comptrollers decision is reasonable infra at  and our conclusions are equally applicable under the lessdeferential standard of skidmore as under chevron step two  there is a pending motion by appellees to strike supplemental exhibits of amici curiae that motion is hereby denied microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized
