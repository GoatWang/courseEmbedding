our holistic approach to investing allowing us to spot opportunities that others may overlook clients come first we actively engage with our clients in a strategic partnership we fundamentally believe that the risks of not sharing significantly exceed the risks of sharing as such we establish an ongoing dialogue with our investors and strive to exceed expectations by providing outstanding levels of client service and transparency we are passionate about our strategies and believe they can provide significant value to our clients over the longterm we are dedicated to delivering the optimal solution in everything we do whether it is research technology or trading based  any market any model we believe that no dataset market or model is out of bounds we are constantly looking for systematic trading opportunities across the globe and actively encourage our people to find alpha in new places the process that turns an idea into a trading strategy is a very systematic and measured one we start with a large number of ideas and we need to work out which of these has the potential to produce sustainable returns for our investors we do that in a twostage process the first is simulation where we take ideas build strategies out of these ideas and see how they would have behaved over a long period of time and through many different environments if we are satisfied with this we move to the second stage of the process where we paper trade the idea we trade it live but on paper so no money is used in the trading but we simulate live trading through the process of time to make sure that this strategy is robust during this live period unconventional and unconstrained thinking we bring a scientific empirical mindset to investing we only trade ideas and theories that we can test and prove we act on evidence and strive to model and understand all aspects of the investment universe but we are not academic theorists we are practical scientists who apply our knowledge to producing something of financial value our unique partnership with the university of oxford the oxfordman institute highlights this the oxfordman institute is a research institute which brings together faculty postdocs and students who are interested in quantitative finance particularly machine learning techniques and data analytics man ahl’s researchers work alongside omi academics and this collaborative approach yields deep academic insight into practical commercial research stateoftheart technology we truly believe that stateofthe art quantitative trading strategies necessitate stateofthe art technology at all stages from market data acquisition and initial research through to model implementation and trade execution this primary focus enables our scientific models to move from concept through backtesting and into production trading with minimum overhead and maximum efficiency having a common programming language and unified codebase promotes collaborative and stimulating working practices where researchers and technologists naturally exchange ideas in an open environment our bestofbreed hardware tools and software engineering practices ensure high levels of productivity quality and the necessary agility to quickly meet the needs of a dynamic business in execution technology our core goal is to ensure best execution for our clients  as we fundamentally consider that competition is key to this we have multiple trading routes ahldeveloped algorithms bestofbreed thirdparty algorithms and a manual trading desk  we continually enforce rigorous competition between these routes to ensure we are always trading optimally follow our tech team on twitter manahltech oxfordman institute the oxfordman institute omi is our unique collaboration with the university of oxford over the last decade the omi part of the university’s department of engineering science has been conducting pioneering research into quantitative finance and now focuses primarily on machine learning techniques and data analytics we believe this initiative is strongly supportive of the ongoing evolution of our quantitative investment strategies we are constantly being presented with new and expanding datasets and machine learning has a huge amount to offer in interpreting this information the omi is part of the university of oxford’s department of engineering science located in the same building as man ahl’s oxford research lab it provides us with a direct connection to cuttingedge machine learning research and allows for the fruitful crosspollination of ideas between the investment and academic communities work done at the omi in areas as seemingly unrelated to investment as galaxy classification and measurement of the height of tides has directly contributed to our investment methodologies we actively use machine learning techniques in our trading programmes and these have become a genuine valueadding approach for man ahl’s clients

evaluating a trading strategy it is routine to discount the sharpe ratio from a historical backtest the reason is simple there is inevitable data mining by both the researcher and by other researchers in the past our paper provides a statistical framework that systematically accounts for these multiple tests we propose a method to determine the appropriate haircut for any given reported sharpe ratio we also provide a profit hurdle that any strategy needs to achieve in order to be deemed significant  june  download authors campbell harvey investment strategy advisor at man group campbell harvey has been an investment strategy advisor at man group since may  he has a phd in finance from the university of chicago he is a professor of finance at duke university and research associate at the national bureau of economic research he served as editor of the journal of finance from  to  and as the  president of the american finance association campbell has over  years of experience constructing and optimising in systematic trading models   introduction a common practice in evaluating backtests of trading strategies is to discount the reported sharpe ratios by  there are good economic and statistical reasons for reducing the sharpe ratios the discount is a result of data mining this mining may manifest itself by academic researchers searching for asset pricing factors to explain the behavior of equity returns or by researchers at firms that specialize in quantitative equity strategies trying to develop protable systematic strategies the  haircut is only a rule of thumb the goal of our paper is to develop an analytical way to determine the magnitude of the haircut our framework relies on the statistical concept of multiple testing suppose you have some new data y and you propose that variable x explains y your statistical analysis finds a significant relation between y and x with a tratio of  which has a probability value of  we refer to this as a single test now consider the same researcher trying to explain y with variables xxx in this case you cannot use the same criteria for significance you expect by chance that some of these variables will produce tratios of  or higher what is an appropriate cuto for statistical significance in harvey and liu hl  we present three approaches to multiple testing we answer the question in the above example the tratio is generally higher as the number of tests or x variables increases consider a summary of our method any given strategy produces a sharpe ratio we transform the sharpe ratio into a t ratio suppose that tratio is  while a tratio of  is highly significant in a single test it may not be if we take multiple tests into account we proceed to calculate a pvalue that appropriately reflects multiple testing to do this we need to make an assumption on the number of previous tests for example harvey liu and zhu hlz  document that at least  factors have been tested in the quest to explain the crosssectional patterns in equity returns suppose the adjusted pvalue is  we then calculate an adjusted tratio which in this case is  with this new t ratio we determine a new sharpe ratio the percentage difference between the original sharpe ratio and the new sharpe ratio is the haircut the haircut sharpe ratio that obtains as a result of multiple testing has the following interpretation it is the sharpe ratio that would have resulted from a single test that is a single measured correlation of y and x we argue that it is a serious mistake to use the rule of thumb  haircut our results show that the multiple testing haircut is nonlinear the highest sharpe ratios are only moderately penalized while the marginal sharpe ratios are heavily penalized this makes economic sense the marginal sharpe ratio strategies should be thrown out the strategies with very high sharpe ratios are probably true discoveries in these cases a  haircut is too punitive our method does have a number of caveats  some of which apply to any use of the sharpe ratio first high observed sharpe ratios could be the results of nonnormal returns for instance an optionlike strategy with high ex ante negative skew in this case sharpe ratios need to be viewed in the context of the skew dealing with these nonnormalities is the subject of future research second sharpe ratios do not necessarily control for risk that is the volatility of the strategy may not reflect the true risk importantly our method also applies to information ratios which use residuals from factor models third it is necessary in the multiple testing framework to take a stand on what qualifies as the appropriate significance level eg is it  or  fourth a choice needs to made on the multiple testing method we present results for three methods as well as the average of the methods finally some judgment is needed specifying the number of tests given choices  it is important to determine the robustness of the haircuts to changes in these inputs we provide a program at httpfacultyfuquadukeeducharveybacktesting that allows the user to vary the key parameters to investigate the impact on the haircuts we also
