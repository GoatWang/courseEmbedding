believe that the replacement portfolios have investment objectives principal investment strategies and principle risks as described in their prospectuses that are substantially similar to the corresponding existing portfolios to make those replacement portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes  information for each existing portfolio and replacement portfolio including investment objectives principal investment strategies principal risks and comparative performance history can be found in the application  applicants state that in selecting the replacement portfolios commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a highquality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed substitutions as is currently available under the contracts contract owners with contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the existing portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed substitutions as before the proposed substitutions with respect to all of the proposed substitutions the combined management fee and rule b fees paid by the replacement portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding existing portfolio the application sets forth the fees and expenses of each existing portfolio and its corresponding replacement portfolio in greater detail  applicants represent that as of the substitution date defined below the separate accounts will redeem shares of the existing portfolios for cash or inkind redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times  each substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions the obligations of the section  applicants and the rights of the affected contract owners under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way commonwealth andor its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the substitutions the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution in addition the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the section  applicants agree that for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed substitution the “substitution date” and for those contracts with assets allocated to the existing portfolio on the substitution date commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter the contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the replacement portfolios net annual operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements for such period exceeds on an annualized basis the net annual operating expenses of the start printed page existing portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application commonwealth will not increase the contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the contracts for a period of at least two years following the substitution date  from the date the presubstitution notice defined below through  days following the substitution date contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in an existing portfolio before the substitution or the replacement portfolio after the substitution to any other available subaccount under the contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations further on the substitution date contract values attributable to investments in each existing portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding replacement portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations moreover commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date  at least  days prior to the substitution date contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the section  applicants received or expect to receive commission approval of the applicable proposed substitutions and of the anticipated substitution date the “presubstitution notice” presubstitution notices sent to contract owners will be filed with the commission pursuant to rule  under the  act the presubstitution notice will advise contract owners that from the date of the presubstitution notice through the date  days after the substitutions contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccounts investing in the existing portfolios before the substitutions or the replacement portfolios after the substitutions to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations among other information the notice will inform affected contract owners that that except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers through at least  days after the substitution date additionally all affected contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable replacement portfolios at least  days before the substitution date  in addition to the supplements distributed to the contract owners within five business days after the substitution date contract owners whose assets are allocated to a replacement portfolio as part of the proposed substitutions will be sent a written notice each a “confirmation” informing them that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified the confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice the confirmation will also reflect the values of the contract owners positions in the existing portfolio before the substitution and the replacement portfolio after the substitution legal analysis  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitutions section c of the  act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the commission section c provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the  act  the section  applicants submit that the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include this provision applicants state that each substitution protects the contract owners who have contract value allocated to an existing portfolio by providing replacement portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives strategies and risks and providing contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than or equal to their corresponding investment options before the substitutions  commonwealth has reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the contracts the contracts and the contracts prospectuses disclose this right  the section  applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment lineups that are available to contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide contract owners with a wide array of investment options the section  applicants state that the proposed substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed substitutions also will permit commonwealth to present information to its contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner the section  applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed substitutions contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the contracts the section  applicants also assert that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section  was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption nor will they affect other aspects of the contracts in addition the proposed substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions accordingly no contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed substitution moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice which supplement will be delivered to the contract owners at least thirty  days before the substitution date and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the substitution date the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that the substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the contracts  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the section  applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed substitutions the section  start printed page applicants state that because the proposed substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the proposed substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  the section  applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing portfolios to the separate accounts immediately thereafter the separate accounts would purchase shares of the replacement portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the existing portfolios accordingly the section  applicants provide that to the extent commonwealth and the existing portfolios and commonwealth and the replacement portfolios are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under section a or section a of the  act it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a accordingly the section  applicants have determined to seek relief from section a  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement portfolios by the separate accounts including the consideration to be paid and received as described in the application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the considered to be paid to each existing portfolio and received by each replacement portfolio involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a under the  act the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contract held by the affected contract owners the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts commonwealth and the trust may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons  the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the separate accounts are consistent with the policies of the trust and the replacement portfolios as provided in the trusts registration statement and reports filed under the  act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act applicants conditions the section  applicants and global atlantic as applicable agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the substitutions will not be effected unless commonwealth determines that i the contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered openend investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application ii the substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws and iii any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the substitutions  after the substitution date global atlantic will not change a subadviser add a new subadviser or otherwise rely on the manager of managers order as defined in the application or any replacement order from the commission with respect to any replacement portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in subadviser the new subadviser or the replacement portfolios ability to rely on the manager of managers order or any replacement order from the commission  commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the substitutions the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution  the substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the obligations of the section  applicants and the rights of the affected contract owners under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way  affected contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in the existing portfolio before the substitution date or the replacement portfolio after the substitution date to any other available investment option under the contract without charge for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date except as described in any market timingshortterm trading provisions of the relevant prospectus the section  applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date  all affected contract owners will be notified at least  days before the substitution date about i the intended substitution of existing portfolios with the replacement portfolios ii the intended substitution date and iii information with respect to transfers as set forth in condition  start printed page above in addition the section  applicants will also deliver to affected contract owners at least thirty days before the substitution date a prospectus for each applicable replacement portfolio  the section  applicants will deliver to each affected contract owner within five business days of the substitution date a written confirmation which will include i a confirmation that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified ii a restatement of the information set forth in the presubstitution notice and iii values of the contract owners positions in the existing portfolio before the substitution and the replacement portfolio after the substitution  for a period of two years following the substitution date for contract owners who were contract owners as of the substitution date commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter the contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the replacement portfolios
