johnson  johnson global strategic design office i had the opportunity to work with crossdisciplinary teams to develop products that focused on healthcare with the goal of improving patients’ lives and their experience with medical devices we strongly believed that user experience has a role in defining the future of healthcare and made the effort to insert design research much earlier into the process this allowed us to design materials to help us observe the interactions between physicians patients and caregivers as a result we were able to identify and design usercentered solutions that were highly attuned to patients’ needs ➝what we were able to gather and produce proved indispensable because it allowed designers to present the users’ voice as well as design rationale with key stakeholders and decision makers it also made it possible for designers to collaborate with other partners within the company in new ways that directly impacted product development  r  d engineers

they reflect ideas of girlhood  womanhood simultaneously while embodying different meanings for both—material print on paperdimension  x  inches magnification formula the magnification formula states that the degree of magnification is contingent on the distance of the object to the distance of the image of the objectconceptually applied if an object were to represent a particular moment in our lives the image of that moment would embody or capture one’s personal perspective of that event in time and space and if distance were to equal the duration of time the “distance” between experience object and perception image is inextricably linked in other words the meaning of an object is directly and equally important dynamically related to its representation in the time space continuum the accompanying images on this page are from a project that attempts to model the exposition and demonstration of my method using the magnification formula as a conceptual springboard i decided to use the doll as my object to children dolls represent the future where through play they can imagine what being an adult would be like for adults on the other hand dolls represent something else entirely

in the visual outcomes of a designer my first goal as a teacher is to encourage a design solution that uses informed research filtered through a students genuine point of view ➝ investigate identify and analyze the design problem design solutions are often identified during the process of learning and understanding the design problem by conducting rounds of problemcentric investigations and by analyzing his or her findings designers will gain confidence and clarity in identifying suitable visual approaches to a design problem experiment in order to arrive at visual solutions that turn information into impactful and appropriate visual experience design is not a onesizefits all practice having a preconceived stylistic visual approach will only result in a one dimensional visual experience which which has its limits to arrive at impactful visual experience a range of ➝visual experimentation must be exercised in order to understand how best to deliver a defined message  develop skill in presentation and articulation graphic design does not live solely in visual form being able to speak about one’s work is as important as producing it the designer’s ability to speak about how design decisions are made from concept development to execution often determines how the design is received by the client i have found in my own practice that articulating design development to a nondesign audience is often part of the design process ➝ encourage interdisciplinary design understanding in order to amplify the student’s ability to work in teams in many settings good design is made by a group of designers specializing in various fields such as design strategy design research industrial design product engineering environmental design user interface  experience design and

johnson resetaa font size print united states court of appealssecond circuit michelle huang as next of friend of raymond yu a minor plaintiffappellant v john a johnson commissioner for the office of children and family services formerly known as the division for youth thomas mcgregor ray anderson matthew barbour and ivan johnson defendantsappellees docket no      decided may   before feinberg winter and cabranes circuit judgeslawrence katz new york ny for plaintiffappellant lee alan adlerstein assistant attorney general eliot spitzer attorney general of the state of new york robert a forte deputy solicitor general and michael s belohlavek assistant solicitor general of counsel new york ny for defendantsappellees michelle huang appeals from judge caseys adverse grant of summary judgment in this  usc §  action brought on behalf of her infant son raymond yu see huang v johnson no  civ   wl  sdny sept    huang argues that yus fourteenth and fourth amendment rights were violated when appelleesall new york correctional officialsimprisoned him without due process and falsely   specifically huang contends that  i yu had a right to a hearing before appellees placed him in a residential facility instead of the less restrictive “day placement” program to which he had previously been assigned  and ii appellees illegally retained yu in custody for eightythree days by failing to credit to his juvenile sentence time served while in pretrial incarceration at rikers island   appellees assert that all of huangs claims are barred by the eleventh amendment   with regard to ii there is a threshold issue as to whether appellants section  claims are barred by heck v humphrey  us   sct   ledd    heck bars section  damages actions in which a judgment in the plaintiffs favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction or sentence where such conviction or sentence has not yet been invalidated reversed on direct appeal or called into question by the issuance of a writ of habeas corpusthe district court held that the governing new york statutes did not give yu either the right to a hearing prior to his placement in the residential facility or the right to credit for the time spent in pretrial incarceration at rikers   the district court also held that huangs claims for money damages were barred under the eleventh amendment because it construed her claims as brought against appellees in their official rather than individual capacitieswe hold that appellees have been sued in their individual capacities and that the eleventh amendment is no bar to this action   however we affirm the district courts decision that yu did not have a right to a hearing before his placement in the residential facility   with regard to the false imprisonment claim we hold that heck does not prevent this action   nevertheless whether yu was detained beyond his statutory release date appears to turn upon whether a new york statute required appellees to credit yu for the time he served at rikers   the testimony of new yorks correctional officials suggests some confusion over calculating the sentences of juveniles in yus circumstances and there is no new york caselaw establishing the proper interpretation of the governing statute   given the number of prisoners whose prison terms might depend on that interpretation we certify the issue to the new york court of appeals   we retain jurisdiction over this appeal pending a response by that courtbackgroundthis appeal raises issues concerning the calculation under new york law of the term of a juvenile delinquents confinement with the office of children and family services “ocfs” when the juvenile is incarcerated in a nonocfs correctional facility on an unrelated but pending criminal charge   appellant contends that under new york executive law § b  time spent in a nonocfs correctional facility on an unrelated charge must be credited against the juveniles sentence with ocfs unless the juvenile has been convicted on the unrelated charge before his sentence with ocfs expires   appellees argue however that as long as the unrelated charge ultimately results in a convictionor alternatively even if it does nottime served in a nonocfs facility cannot be credited to the juveniles sentence with ocfsthe facts are essentially undisputed   yu was adjudicated a juvenile delinquent on march   for attempted assault in the second degree   he was sentenced to eighteen months confinement with new yorks division for youth “dfy” now known as ocfs yus release date was set for september    initially yu served his ocfs confinement at the ella mcqueen residential center a limited securestatus facility where residents are allowed to leave the premises only for appointments relating to school jobs court hearings or medical treatment   on january   yus guardians consented to ocfss suggestion that yu be transferred from ella mcqueen to ocfss brooklyn evening reporting center “erc” day placement program  an erc is less restrictive than a residential center in that it provides daily evening and weekend supervision but permits participants to live at home   the “parental consent” form signed by yus guardians prior to his entry in the erc states that “the division of youth may also choose to terminate this arrangement if satisfactory progress has not been made according to the division” and confirms yus “agreement to follow the conditions of participation for the program”   one of those conditions was that yu report to the program daily   the attachment to the “conditions of participation” form which also was signed by yu states that upon failure to comply with any of the conditions “the division for youth may transfer you to a residential program” or a “different level of dfy program” and “in addition the division for youth may request that the court extend your time of placement”yu was awoldid not report to the programfrom march  until march     consequently his release date was set back two days to september   to account for this absence   on march  yu was again awolthis time for ninetysix daysuntil july     on that date ocfs discovered that yu was being held in the custody of the new york city department of corrections at rikers island on an unrelated charge following an arrest for conduct during the awol period  yus ocfs release date was set back by ninetysix days to december   to reflect the awol periodyu was held at rikers until september   at which time he was returned to ocfs on the date of his return to ocfs custody the charge for which yu had been held at rikers was still pending   upon his return yu was placed in ella mcqueen the residential center rather than in the erc program that had allowed him to live at home   furthermore ocfs set back yus release date by another eightythree days to reflect the period from july  to september   during which yu was at rikers   consequently yus new release date was march  on february   appellee ivan johnson one of yus ocfs counselors sought in new york county family court to extend yus placement with ocfs by six months   both huang and yu were served with notice of the hearing to extend placement which was set for march     after the hearing the family court allowed a temporary extension of yus placement until april   at which time he was released from ocfs custody   yu pleaded guilty to the charge for which he was incarcerated at rikerssecond degree attempted murderbut not until may   a month after his release from ocfs custody in july  huang filed the instant section  action alleging that appellees both in their official and individual capacities  i violated yus fourteenth amendment rights by imprisoning him without due process when they reinstated him at ella mcqueen instead of at the erc without a hearing  ii violated yus fourth and fourteenth amendment rights by not crediting to his ocfs sentence the  days served at rikers thereby falsely imprisoning him from december   until april    and iii conspired to deprive yu of his civil rights in violation of  usc §    huang sought both injunctive relief and  million in damages plus attorneys fees   after huang moved for summary judgment appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings   pursuant to fedrcivp c the district court treated appellees motion as a motion for summary judgment and granted appellees judgment as a matter of law on all claims   see huang  wl  at the district court held that because “it is highly unlikely that money damages would be paid from the pocket of the individual defendants rather than the state” appellees were being sued in their official rather than individual capacities   the court therefore held that the claim for money damages was barred by the eleventh amendment   see id at    the district court further held that yu did not have a right to a hearing upon his reinstatement at ella mcqueen both under the governing new york statute see ny exec law § a and because “the erc consent form clearly states that erc participation is a privilege rather than an entitlement”  huang  wl  at  finally the district court denied the false imprisonment claim and found that yus sentence was correctly calculated   it reasoned that yu was not entitled to credit for time served at rikers because new york executive law § b clearly states that no credit is to be received for time served on an unrelated arrest that culminates in a conviction   see id  this appeal followed   at oral argument the panel requested that counsel address by supplemental briefing the impact on this litigation of heckdiscussion we review the district courts grant of summary judgment de novo   see nabisco inc v warnerlambert co  fd   d cir   summary judgment is appropriate when after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law   see fedrcivp c  brown v c volante corp  fd   d cira the eleventh amendment the eleventh amendment  bars a suit against a state in federal court unless that state has “consented to the litigation or congress has permissibly enacted legislation specifically overriding the states immunity”  russell v dunston  fd   d cir citations omitted   moreover because state immunity extends to state officers who act on behalf of the state see puerto rico aqueduct  sewer auth v metcalf  eddy inc  us    sct   ledd   where the state is the “real substantial party in interest” the eleventh amendment generally bars federal court jurisdiction over actions against state officials acting in their official capacities pennhurst state sch  hosp v halderman  us    sct   ledd     to be sure suits for injunctive relief against state officers rather than against the state itself are permitted provided the relief sought is prospective   see edelman v jordan  us    sct   ledd   however huang seeks money damages as well as prospective injunctive relief   for the damages claim to go forward therefore it must have been brought against appellees in their individual capacities   the district court concluded that given the size of huangs requested award million“it is highly unlikely that the money would be paid from the pocket of the individual defendants rather than the state”  huang  wl  at  the district court therefore found the state to be the real party in interest thereby defeating the damages claim altogether under the eleventh amendment   see id  we disagree   the complaint expressly named each of the appellees in their individual capacities   the fact that the award sought by huang is so large that appellees might not be able to pay it on their own does not transform the claim into one against appellees in their official capacities   cf farid v smith  fd   d cir “the law is clear that a states voluntary decision to indemnify its public servants does not transform a personalcapacity action against a state official into an officialcapacity action against the state”  sales v grant  fd   th cir “it is the entitys potential legal liability rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to reimburse it or to discharge the liability in the first instance that is relevant ․” quoting regents of the univ of cal v doe  us    sct   ledd   the vast majority of section  actions that we see involve circumstances in which the state has agreed to indemnify the individual defendants for any liability incurred   absent that voluntary act the state would not be liable   we acknowledge that in the present age of multitudinous section  actions promises of indemnification may be necessary to hire a work force   nevertheless economic necessity does not alter the fact that the individual state officials are personally liable for judgments in cases such as the present one and to hold otherwise would transfer eleventh amendment immunity to such individualsthe district courts ruling was based largely on ford motor co v dept of treasury  us   sct   led     however that case involved a suit under a state statute for a “ ‘refund’ not for the imposition of personal liability on individual defendants for sums illegally exacted”   id at   sct    in the present case by contrast huang seeks to impose personal liabilityb yus entitlement to a hearing prior to transfer to ella mcqueenthe district court also held that yu was not entitled to a due process hearing when upon his return to ocfs custody from rikers he was placed in ella mcqueen rather than the erc we agree and hold that the placement in a somewhat more restricted facility did not implicate a protected liberty interest requiring a hearingthe new york statute provides  “it shall be within the discretion of the director to modify or terminate a youths participation in day placement at any time   if the day placement is terminated the youth shall be immediately placed in a residential facility consistent with the court order”  ny exec law § a   ella mcqueen is precisely such a residential facility   new york law further provides that the “director may terminate a youths participation in a day placement program at any time for good cause other than the youths breach of conditions of participation   the director shall issue a notice of termination in writing which shall state the reasons for the termination”  ny compcodes r  regs tit  § b   appellees have stated that yus transfer was made because  i yu posed a security risk because the rikers charges involved first degree gang assault and second degree murder  ii he had a history of fleeing  and iii ocfs determined that he had not made satisfactory progress in light of his going awol a “major rule violation”   yus history clearly supports that determination   although it is unclear whether the director ever gave a formal “written notice of termination” yu does not challenge the lack of posttransfer notice but rather contends that he had a right to pretransfer notice of the charges against him and a hearing on those charges  the relevant statutes do not provide that right   see ny exec law § a  ny compcodes r  regs tit  § b alternatively huang contends that there is no meaningful difference between an ercparticipants status and that of individuals in new york state “aftercare” programs or those on parole generally both of whom are entitled to hearings before such status is revoked   see ny compcodes r  regs tit  §  providing hearing when release from aftercare is revoked   we disagree   new york law expressly distinguishes between a “day placement” program which is a “program for youth placed with the division which is an alternative to or includes a period of residential placement” ny exec law § a and an “aftercare program” which is deemed a “conditional release” ny exec law § a   see in re anthony “d”  add   nysd   d dept  “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the day placement program respondent was considered to be ‘in facility’ until such time as he was conditionally released and placed in an ‘aftercare’ program”   nor is yus situation analogous to the revocation of the right to participate in a parole program a preparole conditional supervision program or a workrelease program all of which have been held to implicate protected liberty interests triggering due process requirements   see young v harper  us   sct   ledd   conditional supervision program  morrissey v brewer  us   sct   ledd   parole  kim v hurston  fd  d cir workrelease   although the aftercare program may be analogous to such programs in that it is a conditional release program day placement is more restrictive   in day placement the youth may reside at home but must report to the erc daily for evening and weekend supervision   in young the supreme court stated “the essence of parole is release from prison before the completion of sentence on the condition that the prisoner abide by certain rules during the balance of the sentence”   us at   sct  quoting morrissey  us at   sct    the preparolees in young were required to report to their parole officers only weekly see id at   sct   the erc participants however are supervised by ocfs on a daily basismoreover the erc and ella mcqueen are both part of the unified ocfs “day placement” program that provides alternatives to incarceration   youths at both ella mcqueen and the erc may leave the facility for schooling or work   while it is not an insignificant difference that youths in the erc may sleep at home we find that this distinction is not sufficient to trigger a protected liberty interest   we therefore conclude that the applicable precedent is meachum v fano  us   sct   ledd   in which the supreme court held that due process rights did not attach when inmates were transferred from a lowersecurity prison to a highersecurity one within the same state prison systemfinally it is significant that the erc consent and admittance forms make clear that participation in that program is a privilege not a right   the “parental consent” form states  “i understand that ․ the division has chosen to allow raymond yu to participate in this program․ i also understand that the division for youth may also choose to terminate this arrangement if satisfactory progress has not been made according to the division”   the “conditions of participation” form signed by yu expressly states  “i understand that i am on facility placement status but i have been chosen to participate in this alternative program in my home community   i understand that participation in the erc is not aftercare status and it is a privile ge”   further yu was not transferred directly from the erc to ella mcqueen   rather he was transferred from rikers where he was undoubtedly held after a probable cause hearing to ella mcqueen   any lack of another hearing therefore was harmless in addition to not being requiredc false imprisonmenthuang next contends that yu should have been released on december   because the time served at rikers should have been credited to his sentence with ocfs in support huang relies on new york executive law § b which provideswhen a child who is placed with ocfs ․ is absent from a division facility or an authorized agency without the consent of the director of such facility or authorized agency the absence shall interrupt the calculation of the time of such placement or commitment and such interruption shall continue until the return of the child to the facility or authorized agency in which the child was placed or committed   any time spent by such child in custody from the date of absence to the date the placement ․ resumes shall be credited against the time of such placement or commitment provideda that such custody was due to an arrest or surrender based upon the absence  orb that such custody arose from an arrest or surrender on another charge which did not culminate in a conviction adjudication or adjustmentny exec law § b emphases added   because the charge on which yu was held at rikers was not based on his being awol from ocfs the only applicable provision entitling yu to credit is subsection bb   the district court held that “a plain reading of the statute indicates that ocfs was correct in its decision not to credit yu for this period of time” because “yus time on rikers island did arise from an arrest on another charge and did culminate in a conviction”  huang  wl  at as framed by the district court the relevant question is whether yu was ultimately convicted for the charge on which he was held at rikers as indeed he was when he pleaded guilty to those charges on may     however the plea came more than a month after his release from ocfs custody on april   and therefore several months after ocfss decision not to credit him for the time spent at rikers   the resultant question is whether under the statute it was appropriate for ocfs to deny credit before the outcome of yus criminal case had been determinedthe parties take predictable stances on that question although appellees appear to argue in the alternative that quite apart from whether and when a conviction on the rikers charge was entered yu was not entitled to credit for the length of time that he was not in ocfs custody   because yu was in the custody of the department of corrections for the eightythree days in question they argue he was not entitled to credit for time served whether or not convicted on the rikers charge   the parties further disputeand have submitted supplemental briefing onwhether heck v humphrey  us   sct   ledd   prohibits a section  claim on these facts   we turn first to the heck question and then to the proper interpretation of section b application of the heck rulein heck the supreme court heldin order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a §  plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination or called into question by a federal courts issuance of a writ of habeas corpus  usc §  us at   sct  footnote omitted   the courts rationale was based in part on a desire to “avoid  parallel litigation over the issues of probable cause and guilt” prevent “the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction” and preclude “a convicted criminal defendant from making a ․ collateral attack on the conviction through the vehicle of a civil suit”  id at   sct  internal quotation marks and citations omitted   in edwards v balisok  us   sct   ledd   the court held that heck barred a suit challenging procedural defects at a hearing at which the inmates goodtime credits were revoked because the defects if established would imply the invalidity of that revocation   we have interpreted edwards as focusing primarily on the fact that underlying the inmates claim was a challenge to the length of his confinement   see jenkins v haubert  fd   d cirmost recently in spencer v kemna  us   sct   ledd   the court addressed circumstances in which a petitioner who had completed his entire sentence sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his parole had been improperly revoked   the court held that although the petition was filed before the petitioners incarceration had terminated the expiration of his sentence rendered the petition moot because the petitioner had not suffered collateral consequences from the revocation sufficient to meet article iiis injuryinfact requirement   see us const art   iii §  cl   spencer  us at   sct    however five justices agreed in spencer that the petitioner could still bring a section  action to redress the alleged wrongs   justice souters concurrence which was joined by three other justices statedwe are forced to recognize that any application of heck s favorabletermination requirement to §  suits brought by plaintiffs not in custody would produce a patent anomaly  a given claim for relief from unconstitutional injury would be placed beyond the scope of §  if brought by a convict free of custody as in this case following service of a full term of imprisonment when exactly the same claim could be redressed if brought by a former prisoner who had succeeded in cutting his custody short through habeasthe better view then is that a former prisoner no longer “in custody” may bring a §  action establishing the unconstitutionality of a conviction or confinement without being bound to satisfy a favorabletermination requirement that it would be impossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy   thus the answer to petitioners argument that his habeas claim cannot be moot because heck bars him from relief under §  is that heck has no such effect   after a prisoners release from custody the habeas statute and its exhaustion requirement have nothing to do with his right to any reliefid at   sct  souter j concurring footnote omitted   justice stevenss dissent also recognized that “given the courts holding that petitioner does not have a remedy under the habeas statute it is perfectly clear ․ that he may bring an action under  usc § ”   id at  n   sct  stevens j dissenting   moreover dictum in the majority opinion also suggested that the petitioner would not be barred under heck from bringing a section  action provided “petitioner were to seek damages ‘for using the wrong procedures not for reaching the wrong result’ and if that procedural defect did not ‘necessarily imply the invalidity of’ the revocation”  id at   sct  quoting heck  us at    sct we have addressed similar issues under the heck rule   in jenkins we held that “for those cases at the heart of habeas corpusthose in which a prisoner challenges the fact or length of his confinementhabeas is the exclusive federal remedy”  jenkins  fd at    however jenkins involved an inmates challenge to the conditions of confinement rather than its fact or duration and we therefore held that heck did not apply   see id at    in leather v eyck  fd  d cir we further held that a plaintiff who was convicted on a charge of driving while impaired but who was fined rather than imprisoned was not barred under heck from bringing a section  action becausealthough plaintiffs action does not challenge conditions of confinement jenkins implies the inapplicability of heck for him   because plaintiff is not and never was in the custody of the state he like jenkins has no remedy in habeas corpus   having escaped the jaws of heck leather should therefore be permitted to pursue his §  claim in the district court unless principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel preclude his suitid at   see also sims v artuz  fd   d cir holding section  action not barred where challenge is to conditions of confinement rather than fact or duration based on these authorities we conclude that heck does not bar huangs section  action   while huangs challenge is aimed at the duration of yus confinement she does not challenge the validity of yus conviction   furthermore yu has no habeas remedy because he has long since been released from ocfs custody   in light of our holding in leather and in light of both the spencer majoritys dictum and the fact that the spencer concurrences and dissent “revealed that five justices hold the view that where federal habeas corpus is not available to address constitutional wrongs §  must be” jenkins  fd at  we conclude that huangs section  claim must be allowed to proceed   having so decided we now turn to the merits of the false imprisonment claim calculation of yus release datewhether yus rights were violated turns upon the meaning of executive law subsection bb   if that provision means that a period of pretrial detention served on an unrelated charge must be credited to a youths confinement with ocfs so long as the charge does not result in a conviction before the youths confinement with ocfs ends whether or not there is an ultimate conviction then yu was unlawfully detained after his release date   unfortunately there is no helpful new york authority on the precise interpretation of section b pertinent to this appeal   see eg in re angel f  add   nysd   st dept  holding credit due for time served on charges that were “eventually dismissed” but not stating whether dismissal occurred before ocfs sentence expired and whether the time on the unrelated charges was served in ocfs custody  in re anthony “d”  nysd at  holding no credit due on ocfs sentence for time served in state jail because the “unrelated criminal charges culminated in a conviction” but not stating whether conviction occurred prior to expiration of ocfs sentenceindeed it is less than clear that ocfs even has a uniform practice in the manner in which it applies subsection bb   appellees state only that “the computer system maintained by ocfs uniformly and automatically interrupts the time credit of a youth upon the entry of a noted absence” and that the “interruption continues unless and until ocfs is notified of an event under b subsections a or b in which event the appropriate time credit” is given   appellees postargument letter memorandum at  n  huang no    this however tells us nothing of the criteria used to determine whether an “event” under bb has occurredmoreover appellees deposition testimony suggests substantial confusion over the proper interpretation of the statute   appellees anderson and barbour indicated that the key factor is not whether there has been a conviction but whether the youth is being held outside of ocfs custody   that view seemingly assumes that time served in the jurisdiction of another agency such as the department of corrections cannot be credited to confinement with ocfs appellee ivan johnson agreed with anderson and barbour but also noted that there have been situations in which credit has been given for time served in another jurisdictions custody   appellees brief states that the key factor is whether the unrelated arrest eventually ends in a conviction but also states that yu was not credited for either the awol period or the period of time served because during both he was “outside of ocfs supervision”   brief for defendantsappellees at  huang no we are mindful of the somewhat anomalous result to which huangs proposed interpretation leads   a youth would be credited for pretrial detention time served after committing a serious crime simply because the conviction occurs after release   however appellees position that a postrelease conviction validates a denial of credit for time served elsewhere is itself anomalous   a youth might serve the extra time as a result of the denial of credit and then be acquitted   finally appellees alternative position that credit must be denied for periods of time served “outside of ocfs supervision” id seems hard to square with the statutory language we believe that the interpretation of subsection bb should be determined by the new york court of appeals upon a certificate from this court   see ny compcodes r  regs tit  §   d cir r §  the statute has no inexorable interpretation and there is no governing caselaw on point   confusion as to the statute also seems to exist among new york correctional officials   rather than set a precedent that may differ from the view of the new york court of appeals and possibly be disruptive in new york correctional affairs we think that the better course of action is for the new york court to decide this important issue of new york law   moreover given our holding that heck does not bar false imprisonment claims when the plaintiff has no remedy in habeas corpus we may see other false imprisonment claims such as the present one brought under section    we hasten to add that our certificate invites the new york court of appeals to address any other issue of new york law bearing on the disposition of this appealconclusionthe decision of the district court that a hearing was not required prior to yus return to ella mcqueen is affirmed   however we reverse the district courts conclusion that huangs claims are barred by the eleventh amendment   we further hold that heck does not bar huangs  usc §  action for false imprisonment   however we certify to the new york court of appeals the question of whether appellees properly refused to credit to yus sentence with ocfs the time he served at rikers island   it is hereby ordered that the clerk of the court transmit to the clerk of the new york court of appeals a certificate in the form attached together with this opinion and a complete set of the briefs appendices and record filed by the parties with this court   this panel retains jurisdiction so that after we receive a response from the new york court of appeals we may dispose of the appeal   further the parties are ordered to bear equally such fees and

thomas mcgregor ray anderson matthew barbour and ivan johnson defendantsappelleespursuant to ny comp codes r  regs tit  §  and d cir r §  we present the following certificate to the new york court of appeals this is a  usc §  action for damages and injunctive relief brought by michelle huang on behalf of her infant son raymond yu   huang argues that yus fourth and fourteenth amendment rights were violated when appellees officials of new york states office of children and family services “ocfs” falsely imprisoned him by refusing to credit to his sentence with ocfs eightythree days he served in the custody of the new york city department of corrections at rikers island   in march  yu went awol from ocfs custody for ninetysix days until july   when ocfs learned that yu was being held at rikers on an unrelated criminal charge   yu spent eightythree more days at that facility before being returned to ocfs custody   ocfs set back yus release date by the ninetysix days that he was awol as well as by the eightythree days that he spent at rikers   the district court denied huangs motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to appellees on the ground that new york executive law subsection bb expressly provides that time spent in custody on an unrelated charge that culminates in a conviction cannot be credited to a youths sentence with ocfs   however yu did not plead guilty to the charge on which he was held at rikers until may   more than one month after his april   release from ocfs custody the dispositive issue presented by this appeal for which there is no controlling precedent of the new york court of appeals is whether appellees properly refused to credit yu under new york executive law subsection bb for the eightythree days served at rikers on an unrelated charge that did not culminate in a conviction until after yus release from ocfs custody we request that the new york court of appeals address the above question at this time because the text of subsection bb does not provide a clear answer   moreover if not definitively answered pursuant to this certificate the question will recur in federal actions because claims for false imprisonment are frequently brought in section  actions and we have held today that such claims are permitted under  usc §  when asserted by a prisoner after release the new york court of appeals is invited to
