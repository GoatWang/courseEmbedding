these loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions in the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for postclosing working capital expenses  the representatives have agreed to defer their underwriting

underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the representatives from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the representatives will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing  estimated amount of total retainer fees to be paid to the independent directors in the twoyear period from the closing of this offering  estimated amount of total franchise taxes to be paid by us in the twoyear period from the closing of this offering  our founder or its affiliates will agree to provide us with a loan of up to  for working capital requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business combination in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our founder or an affiliate of our founder or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us additional funds as may be required of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants approximately  or approximately  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full including up to  or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a us based trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of a the completion of our initial business combination or b the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law based on current interest rates we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account net of income taxes will be sufficient to pay delaware franchise taxes for  the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our founder members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us commencing on the date of this prospectus we have agreed to pay oags management llc an affiliate of our founder a total of  per month for office space utilities secretarial support and administrative services upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees prior to the closing of this offering our founder has agreed to loan us up to  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of august   or the closing of this offering the loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses our founder or its affiliates will agree to provide us with a loan of up to  for working capital requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business combination in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our founder or an affiliate of our founder or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us additional funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans other than the loan of up to  to be provided by our founder or its affiliates if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our founder directors officers advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the transaction agreement for our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i the completion of our initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to the founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholder has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to the founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our founder or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business in addition our ability to identify a target business for our initial business combination will be limited by the opportunities available in the onshore us oil and natural gas industry furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses we have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any potential business combination target our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will be focused on the onshore us oil and natural gas industry however we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector we intend to focus our search on businesses that may provide opportunities for attractive riskadjusted equity returns our management and affiliates of our founder have experience in identifying acquiring developing and operating onshore oil and natural gas properties which we believe will allow us to pursue a broad range
