business first set up an llc which you can do here online otherwise you will need to select a structure other than the llc business structure for example selecting a business structure determines how the government will tax you for example an llc has a more favorable tax treatment compared to a sole owner regardless of legal structure all businesses need a business license and an ein but also need to select a legal stucture choosing from sole propritor partnership llc or corproration more about selecting a structure ✔  thus file a dba if you dont file an llc you are required to file a dba if you are a partneship or a sole owner and you dont form an llc if you form an llc you need an llc certificate if you select the llc structure etc a dba llc or corporation certificate is issued by the state a dba doing business as is the registration of your businesss name a dba is also called a fictitious assumed business name or trade name important you dont need to file a dba if you form an llc

sell it in smaller amounts to reseller’s such as department highvolume and specialty stores or directly to the consuming public  so for example a manufacturer in china produces tshirts by the millions  you enter into a deal to buy  tshirts fob long beach port  you pay them and they ship it to the usa  you pick it up and you store them in a warehouse  you advertise and sell small or large amounts of tshirts to retailers or individual consumers  the term wholesale as opposed to retail means that you buy and sell large quantities usually just for resale of these merchandise related

be a good idea though some start with an s corp on the other hand if you want to issue shares you may want a c corporation if your business name is desusanwestratch  incco requires a fictitious business name registration which also requires a fee to be registered registering a fictitious business name does not protect that name nor does it protect the business owner from personal liability related to business actions as setting up a limited liability company llc does our recommendation that since you need to pay a fee to register the business name simply form a limited liability company llc for a similar fee and get both corporate status and protection for the name as well as personal liabilities so for instance if someone slips and falls in your business premises they can sue you personally if you are not a limited liability company llc also consider the prestige that a limited liability company llc affords is a name like johns transmissiona shop better than aemcoo trans llc q
