launching our first education and training event in march and we exceeded our internal goals for revenue and profitability  early in the second quarter we successfully expanded these activities in china  based on our continuing efforts toward restructuring our usbased activities we hope to achieve an operating profit by mid mr wang concluded the significant net losses and decreased revenues compared to the previous years first quarter were unfortunately expected and are partandparcel of the process of restructuring and transforming our usbased businesses during the quarter revenues declined  million to  million compared to the same period in   the revenue decline was primarily due to the elimination of unprofitable revenues in our napw membership segment as we focus on creating higher lifetime value of the napw memberships we sell by enhancing our membership value and brand positioning  total costs and expenses increased to  million compared to  million in the same period in   the periodoverperiod increase was primarily caused by ga expenses supporting the changeofcontrol and investment by cfl and the continuing restructuring and rebuilding of the companys usbased businesses  included in the expenses is approximately  million that we do not expect to recur offset by significant decreases in all other cost and expense categories  excluding these nonrecurring costs total costs and expenses would have declined significantly compared to the yearago quarter loss from operations increased to  million compared to  million for the same quarter in  primarily as a result of nonrecurring costs and the decrease in revenue at napw  commensurately net loss increased  million to  million while net loss per common share remained flat at  compared to the first quarter of last year following are highlights of the activities and development in each of our business segments napw for the first quarter  napw revenue declined   million compared to the same quarter of   this significant decline is primarily a result of management efforts to downsize the sales team at napw and to focus on  the elimination of unprofitable revenue streams and  rebuilding a foundation to grow membership based on increasing the value of an napw membership through better services and brand positioning  these ongoing efforts together with cash management activities that impacted lead generation spending in the quarter also resulted in further decline in new membership bookings compared to the same quarter in  this decline in new membership bookings will continue to negatively impact napws revenue for several quarters as a function of the amortization of revenue deferral of prior period bookings we believe the restructuring efforts and rebuilding of napw’s digital marketing capabilities are beginning to show positive signs in brand awareness and member engagement as evidenced by significant increases in several of our internal key performance indicators kpis  as our brand building and digital and content marketing initiatives continue combined with a strategic and purposeful rebuild of the sales force we expect to see improvements in napw’s long term performance due to the nature of key elements of the napw restructuring and rebuilding initiatives we expect revenue to stabilize in  and to begin to improve in early   we believe we are executing the appropriate strategy that will allow us to optimize the performance of the napw business and position it for sustained longterm success pdn network and noble voice we also made significant changes in operations of our pdn network and noble voice businesses which we have long believed have the potential for growth but which have historically lagged our napw segment in terms of revenue generation  during the first quarter the pdn network and noble voice businesses combined to represent more than   million of our overall revenue with pdn network revenue growing more than   thousand and noble voice revenue growing more than   thousand periodoverperiod in january  we unified the management of pdn network and noble voice to align with managements original vision for these businesses when we first purchased noble voice in late   we believe integration of noble voice and pdn network businesses will facilitate capture of natural synergies between the noble voice call center operations and the pdn network recruiting business ultimately creating new revenue opportunities and allowing us to move into new markets   noble voice is currently matching over  job seekers a day to one or more career opportunities and providing continuing education advice to job seekers who may benefit from a more advanced degree or certification we have invested in technology to provide multiple career matches per job seeker and in management systems to provide greater value to diverse job seekers and our employment clients we believe the periodoverperiod growth seen in the first quarter of  is an early affirmation of our decision to unify management of these businesses favorable market trends in career and education service categories have helped our matching and placement rates and we are adding more telesales representatives and increasing our bb marketing efforts using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence for email marketing to meet growing demand china operations we began our china operations education and training business on march   when we held our first publicly available educationtraining session  that session attracted approximately  paying attendees and generated  in revenue  we held three additional events in april which attracted approximately  attendees and plan to hold up to twenty similar events over the balance of this year  management strongly believes in the viability of our china operations model which forms the basis for the substantial investment made by cfl  we are excited about the team we have assembled to execute this strategy and believe our early results confirmed our plans we plan to launch our chinabased womens networking business over the summer months in  and our international education support business in the fourth quarter of   while expansion into china has added to our expense structure we believe that increased revenues will offset the costs associated with china expansion in the subsequent quarters of  and beyond the company is implementing an asset light approach towards building significant operations in china and while we have invested in staff and offices we have not had to make any investments in acquisitions or large infrastructure projects  in his concluding remarks michael wang the company’s ceo noted “our efforts to refine domestic operations are making progress with two of our three operating units achieving revenue increases in the quarter  our napw business is also making qualitative improvements to increase the lifetime value of our members a key performance indicator for our future success  what is most important is that our efforts to launch our commercial activities in china have surpassed our internal goals for attendance revenue and profitability  we are accelerating our activities in the second quarter and feel very positive about the future stability of our us operations and our potential for future longterm growth from commercial activities in china” jim kirsch the company’s executive cochairman added “we have worked hard to put the company in a position to sustain reasonable growth in the us while seeking new growth internationally  we have an exceptional group of people both in the us and china who are committed to creating value for our shareholders members and business partners  i firmly believe that the good work we are doing for our society helping people achieve their professional aspirations with both job opportunities and continuing education advisory services are directly aligned with being a very profitable company furthermore i am impressed with our quick start out of the gate in china and the vast potential the china expansion has for our future i want to express my personal gratitude to all who have supported the company
