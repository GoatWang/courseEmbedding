extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas and other competitive conditions it is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the registrant the registrant does not have longterm contracts with purchasers of its crude oil or natural gas the market for crude oil is such that the registrant anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce natural gas will be sold to local distribution companies gas marketers and end users on the spot market the spot market reflects immediate sales of natural gas without longterm contractual commitments the future market condition for natural gas cannot be predicted with any certainty and the registrant may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices many aspects of the registrant�s activities are highly competitive including but not limited to the acquisition of suitable drilling prospects and the procurement of drilling and related oil field equipment and are subject to governmental regulation both at federal and state levels the registrant�s ability to compete depends on its financial resources and on the managing general partner�s staff and facilities none of which are significant in comparison with those of the oil and gas exploration development and production industry as a whole federal and state regulation of oil and gas operations generally includes drilling and spacing of wells on producing acreage the imposition of maximum allowable production rates the taxation of

natural gas sales will generally tend to increase during the winter months order backlog is not pertinent to the registrant�s business item  properties the registrant�s properties consist primarily of

through the underground rock strata where plaintiffs own oil and gas leasehold interests plaintiffs assert moc�s wellbore would constitute a permanent trespass causing plaintiffs irreparable injury and seek to enjoin the drilling of the well plaintiffs claim moc�s filing of an application to drill the well with regulatory bodies constitutes a deliberate and malicious interference with the contractual relationships between plaintiffs and their lessors �����moc believes it has the right to drill its la huerta well as planned the bottom hole location for the well is within a residential area nearby the city of carlsbad new mexico a surface location for the well within the se of section� is not feasible or appropriate due to the proximity of residences and the inability to construct and use a natural gas pipeline to gather and transport natural gas produced by the well thus moc proposes to drill a deviated well from a surface location within the se of section�for which moc has acquired a surface use easement and agreement the wellbore would traverse the se of section� and the ne of section� before entering moc�s leasehold area in the s of section� after moc notified

contested plaintiffs� claims moc believes that plaintiffs should not be permitted to block the drilling of the la huerta well unless plaintiffs can show that their leasehold rights in the se of section� and the ne of section� would be interfered with unreasonably by moc�s well moc further believes plaintiffs failed to prove such unreasonable interference would occur as a result of the drilling of the la huerta well by order dated march�  the court denied plaintiffs� application for injunctive relief finding that moc would not be trespassing upon plaintiffs� oil and gas leasehold estates that moc�s operations would not interfere with operation of plaintiffs� oil and gas leasehold interests either surface or subsurface and that plaintiffs would not suffer irreparable damage in any respect plaintiffs have advised moc that they will appeal the court�s ruling moc does not believe the court�s order will be reversed on appeal accordingly moc has commenced drilling operations on

of the program�s gas reserves are being sold regionally in the spot market due to the highly competitive nature of the spot market prices are subject to wide seasonal and regional pricing fluctuations in addition such spot market sales are generally shortterm in nature and are dependent upon obtaining transportation services provided by pipelines the prices received for the program�s oil and gas are subject to influences such as global consumption and supply trends the partnership follows the fullcost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities under the fullcost method all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized depreciation depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the unitsofproduction method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties at december�  approximately  of capitalized costs were excluded from amortization the excluded costs were development costs incurred in  on wells in progress these costs will be subject to amortization in  proceeds from the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool gains and losses are not recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves
