kreppold doris ruckdeschel ferdinand dirschmid the trend in the previous years showed that an ideal product is not obtained as a sum of development results of several separated disciplines but rather as a result of a holistic multidisciplinary cae approach in the course of the whole component development process it is necessary to consider all functions of an individual component equivalent to their importance in the system as a whole in order to achieve both a technical and a financial optimum the predictability and the accuracy of an individual computational method have to be regarded against the background of the entire simulation process a continuative caestandard and a harmonious interaction between the different computational disciplines promise more success than focusing specifically on individual topics and thereby neglecting the “bigger picture” this awareness provided the basis for a decision to change the entire crash simulation software to abaqus a modern development process to bring silence into interior components 6 technical paper 9 eberhard michael kreppold comfort and wellbeing have always been connected with a flawless interior acoustic free of any background noise or bsr buzz squeak and rattle bsr noises dominate the interior acoustic and represent one of the main sources for discomfort often causing considerable warranty costs traditionally bsr issues have been identified and rectified through extensive hardware testing which by its nature intensifies toward the end of the car development process in the following paper the integration of a virtual bsr validation technique in a modern development process by the use of appropriate cae methods is presented the goal is to shift in compliance with the front loading concept the development activities into the early phase the approach is illustrated through the example of an instrument panel from the early concept draft for single components to an assessment of the complete assembly an advanced process for virtual evaluation of the dimensional resistance of interior parts  technical paper  eberhard michael kreppold the importance of the automotive interior as a characteristic feature in the competition for the goodwill of the customer has increased significantly in recent years whilst there are established more or less efficient cae processes for the solution of problems in the areas of occupant safety and service strength until now the implementation of cae in themes such as dimensional stability warpage and corrugation of plastic parts has been little investigated the developmental support in this field is predominantly carried out by means of hardware tests real plastic components alter their form as a result of internal forces often during the first weeks following production the process known as “creep” can continue over an extended period of time and is exacerbated by high ambient temperatures and additional external loads stemming
