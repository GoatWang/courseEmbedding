starting dose is one mg tablet once daily afinitor® everolimus tablets should be taken consistently with or consistently without food taken at the same time every day swallowed whole with a glass of water and should not be broken or crushed  continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs dose management dose adjustments are required for patients with hepatic impairment and may be required for drug interactions cypapgp inhibitors or inducers and adverse reactions management of severe or intolerable adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruption with or without a dose reduction of afinitor therapy or discontinuation if dose reduction is required the suggested dose is approximately  lower than the daily dose previously administered mg mg and mg tablets are available if dose adjustment is required avoid use with grapefruit grapefruit juice or st john’s wort reference afinitor prescribing information east hanover nj novartis pharmaceuticals corp  important safety information afinitor® everolimus tablets is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to everolimus to other rapamycin derivatives or to any of the excipients noninfectious pneumonitis noninfectious pneumonitis was reported in up to  of patients treated with afinitor some cases reported with pulmonary hypertension including pulmonary arterial hypertension as a secondary event the incidence of common terminology criteria ctc grade  and  noninfectious pneumonitis was up to  and up to  respectively fatal outcomes have been observed monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia pjp should be considered in the differential diagnosis manage noninfectious pneumonitis by dose interruption until symptoms resolve follow with a dose reduction and consider the use of corticosteroids discontinue afinitor if toxicity recurs at grade  or for grade  cases for patients who require use of corticosteroids prophylaxis for pjp may be considered the development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose infections afinitor has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial fungal viral or protozoal infections including those with opportunistic pathogens localized and systemic infections including pneumonia mycobacterial infections other bacterial infections invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis candidiasis or pjp and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis b virus have occurred some of these infections have been severe eg leading to sepsis respiratory failure or hepatic failure or fatal physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with afinitor treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections should be completed prior to starting treatment with afinitor be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection and institute appropriate treatment promptly interruption or discontinuation of afinitor should be considered discontinue afinitor if invasive systemic fungal infection is diagnosed and institute appropriate antifungal treatment pjp has been reported in patients who received everolimus sometimes with a fatal outcome this may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents consider prophylaxis for pjp when concomitant use of these agents is required angioedema with concomitant use of angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors patients taking concomitant ace inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema eg swelling of the airways or tongue with or without respiratory impairment in a pooled analysis the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ace inhibitor was  compared to  in the control arm with an ace inhibitor   oral ulceration mouth ulcers stomatitis and oral mucositis have occurred in patients treated with afinitor at an incidence ranging from  to  across the clinical trial experience grade  stomatitis was reported in  to  of patients in such cases topical treatments are recommended but alcohol hydrogen peroxide iodine or thymecontaining mouthwashes should be avoided antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed  renal failure cases of renal failure including acute renal failure some with a fatal outcome have been observed in patients treated with afinitor impaired wound healing everolimus delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of woundrelated complications like wound dehiscence wound infection incisional hernia lymphocele and seroma these woundrelated complications may require surgical intervention exercise caution with the use of afinitor in the perisurgical period  laboratory tests and monitoring elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported renal function including measurement of blood urea nitrogen urinary protein or serum creatinine should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter particularly in patients who have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported blood glucose and lipids should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter more frequent monitoring is recommended when afinitor is coadministered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia management with appropriate medical therapy is recommended when possible optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on afinitor reductions in hemoglobin lymphocytes neutrophils and platelets have been reported monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to treatment and periodically thereafter  drugdrug interactions avoid coadministration with strong cypapgp inhibitors eg ketoconazole itraconazole clarithromycin atazanavir nefazodone saquinavir telithromycin ritonavir indinavir nelfinavir voriconazole use caution and reduce the afinitor dose to  mg daily if coadministration with a moderate cypapgp inhibitor is required eg amprenavir fosamprenavir aprepitant erythromycin fluconazole verapamil diltiazem avoid coadministration with strong cypapgp inducers eg phenytoin carbamazepine rifampin rifabutin rifapentine phenobarbital however if coadministration is required consider doubling the daily dose of afinitor using increments of  mg or less hepatic impairment exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with hepatic impairment for patients with severe hepatic impairment childpugh class c afinitor may be used at a reduced dose if the desired benefit outweighs the risk for patients with mild childpugh class a or moderate childpugh class b hepatic impairment a dose reduction is recommended  vaccinations the use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with afinitor  embryofetal toxicity fetal harm can occur if afinitor is administered to a pregnant woman advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus advise female patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception while using afinitor and for  weeks after ending treatment adverse reactions the most common adverse reactions incidence ≥ were stomatitis  infections  diarrhea  peripheral edema  fatigue  and rash  the most common grade  adverse reactions incidence ≥ were infections  stomatitis  diarrhea  fatigue  and hyperglycemia   laboratory abnormalities the most common laboratory abnormalities incidence ≥ all grades were anemia  hypercholesterolemia  lymphopenia  elevated aspartate transaminase  and hyperglycemia  the most common grade
