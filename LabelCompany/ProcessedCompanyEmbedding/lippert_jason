product called duratop detroiter mobile homes and redman industries were bl’s first customers in  don sold his shares of bl to larry the strong foundation laid by larry led lci to develop many

deal with william “bill” redman bill’s son donald redman became managing partner of bl industries alongside larry in exchange for cash to rebuild the plants and to fund additional expansion shortly thereafter bl industries expanded into pennsylvania kansas georgia and michigan bl’s corporate office moved into a larger building in alma mi the old alma products building in  larry bought out donald

turn the call over to jason lippert jason jason lippert thanks tyler good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on today’s call as we continue to focus on strategic plan and objectives total revenues in q reached approximately  million up almost  from  million in first quarter of  our eps grew from  per diluted share to  per diluted share an  april sales were very strong coming indiscernible million compared to  million in april of  a  increase the industries that we serve on a roll and enjoying steady and solid growth the top story for our company through q is continued rv industry growth the shipments top the record  year high backlog are at record leveled off so with some oems backward into august on several product lines and dealers are reporting great retail traffic and record show attendance additionally oems are continuing to add capacity in opening new production facilities to meet continued increased demand once you factor these and along with the customer confidence at a near  year high and the stability and gas and consumer lending always indicators point to a banner year for  where shipments could reach over  units in addition we remain very positive about our organic sales growth as we estimate our total addressable market opportunities are just over  billion we and other industry leaders have been saying for the last two years now that we feel confident that the industry will hit  units at some point before  and we still feel strongly about that statement rv products are attractive and more affordable with more technology and features that are clearly attracting new age groups and authenticities to the european outdoors lifestyle in a recent rv business in wells fargo survey  of the dealers surveyed said they notice an appreciable amount of first time buyers in  which is huge for our business gen x and millennial generations are purchasing their first entry level rv’s and are adopting the mobile lifestyle in bigger than anticipated numbers and as these younger generations are first time buyers adopt the mobile lifestyle it will help sustain longterm help of the rv industry the outdoor industry association recently released a study showing that the outdoors industry in total generates almost  billion in annual revenue twice that of automobiles and other big ticket consumer items this point to the fact that the outdoors lifestyle is one that is a very important to may americans community family and outdoors are ingrained deeply in american way of life and this will continue to bring more people to the rv lifestyle our content for the trailing  month was up about  from q  to  for towable rv and up about  over q  to  per motorhome increasing demand for travel trailers continue to be a trend and while we have less content on travel trailers and fifthwheels we have demonstrated the ability to increase content per vehicle yearoveryear for over  years we have a proven ability to develop product and add content and new features to existing products and penetrate all vehicle classes and brands as well as execute on growing market share in existing and new product lines because we realize how important new product growth is to our continued strategy and success we have bolstered our world class research and development teams last year we released the industry’s first ever one touch automatic leveling system designed for travel trailers and it was a big success as the only true and patented automatic leveling system for trailers on the market we are already averaging a few  systems per week we expect at the open house in august that many other brands will pick up this popular trend started about six years ago when we launched the first ever patented fifthwheel automatic leveling system the days with manually cranking jacks up and down on any sized rvs are coming to an end our leveling systems have been working their way into lower and lower price points and now are hitting the travel trailers which is the largest segment in rvs this year we will release an aftermarket version of leveling that can be installed on any of the several million used travel trailers that are already on the road today we also recently launched some great new hitching concepts such as the jacket bike carrier and indiscernible crack hitch related products are approximately  million market because our dealers are taking more and more things with them when they travel we are trying to develop more creative hitching solutions that fit right into our chassis products also we are continuing momentum with our myrv product line which allows rvs to connect many of their rv products and functionality to their mobile devices we expect to see significant traction in the coming years and feel we are in the driver set as we not only develop the technology but many products our viewers want connectivity to our lci products we have also recently launched more new warning products in the oem and aftermarket as well as the new entry step which are all creating a lot of excitement in the industry and another development we launched our marine rd recently and now working on some exciting new seeding electronic and hydraulic related products for both all in all rd will continue to be a huge driver of our organic growth at lci growth outside the rv industry and our adjacent markets continued as our sales were up here  from q  recently we attended two shows in the heavy trucking industry as well as a national educational procurement show touting our vast manufacturing capabilities feedback and reception at these two shows were extremely positive and present new revenue opportunities for our many product lines the marine industry continues to grow at a steady pace and has plenty of market share opportunity we have several new products in the pipeline designed specifically to enhance the boring lifestyle and an exciting new development for us next month we will be attending the home and hardware show and debut our residential awning product line which we believe is approximately a  million market we’ve also designed new mattress products for college dorms which is approximately  million market considering we build more mattresses annually than anyone else in the country we should be in a great position to own in this new space whether it’s awnings windows mattresses furniture steel or aluminum products we have the facilities the products the leadership teams and a proven ability to develop customer relationships with our fantastic sales and operations teams our adjacent market strategy will continue to be very important to our growth story as we organically and through acquisitions grow in these adjacent markets aftermarket sales grew  from q  to  million in q  we have invested heavily in this area over the last  months by adding over  professionals in our call center along with personnel additions we’ve added some significant onetime cost to get our awning program rolling at many rv dealers and wholesale distributors mix shift also contributed to our decrease in operating profit compared to q  in the aftermarket segment and we believe we will see improvement in coming quarters we are still in early innings in the aftermarket opportunity as we continue to set up more and more dealers and wholesale distributors and really work to make sure there will be a longterm margin growth and traction in all aftermarket not just the rv aftermarket most importantly lci puts over  billion plus in component parts into new rv vehicles every year we’ve expanded our content into other adjacent markets which will lead – which will lend itself eventually to aftermarket sales in those markets such as marine buses and cargo trailers april’s aftermarket sales were  million up significantly compared to  million last april a  increase with over  billion worth of components in the rv market today coupled with our continued focus on being the industry leader on oem component sales and customer service along with turbocharge new product development aftermarket sale should continue on a great pace of growth for the foreseeable future in february we announced the acquisition of sessa klein outside of milan italy which manufactures highly engineered window systems for high speed and commuter trains there are train systems all over the world that utilize sessa klein’s window systems and with their excellent leadership team we’re confident that we will be able to grow this new adjacency given lci’s commitment to add resources even more exciting is our strategy to engage them to help design window products for the caravan industry in europe sessa klein sales total approximately  million in  beside somewhat restricted them from landing larger contracts with train manufacturers but now with the backing of our company of our size and integrity there are more of these larger volume opportunities available for them we are seeing new acquisition opportunities the pipeline remains full seven of our last nine over  million revenues of acquisitions have focused on products that are outside of our core rv market while we plan on making opportunistic acquisitions in the rv industry we are laser focused on signing good acquisition candidates to supply products to the bus marine heavy truck cargo trailer trains and international caravan markets as well as aftermarket for all these markets as our brand and reputation has grown over the last several years in these areas acquisition conversations become easier much like it did in the rv market our longterm focus on strategy in these markets is working and potential customers are taking notice and are excited about our people our product development and service strategies in addition as part of our acquisition strategy we are focusing our attention on acquisition candidates whose revenues are much larger than in past acquisitions i want to take a second make sure we address the well documented tight labor market in our industry specifically in elkhart county as a result of the outstanding industry growth very long appointment often comes higher attrition and our industry has not been immune to this problem overtime it’s been running higher for everyone to these labor constraints and the average wage for employ is up as every business in the areas fighting for employees although it says increased attrition and labor costs in most businesses we feel we are very much better than most of our industry peers in the category of attrition due to our intent preparation of focus we’re working more than ever on continuously improving our organization by focusing on how we touch the lives of our team members and boosting the cultural environment and strategy of our business and more harmony with our business strategy as a result we believe our increase in our labor costs yearoveryear were not a size it could have been wages that lci definitely increase but our attrition rate has helped to lower the overall impact as we drop  points over last year’s attrition results through the first four months in addition we’ve invested heavily in employee programs that we believe will help us to retain our team members over the longterm these added resources range from leadership personnel operations and hr personnel to training and leadership programming these costs are shortterm but we believe they will help us sustain lower attrition over the coming years and make our business even more successful then we’ll ultimately improve key metrics like quality safety and efficiency we can’t solve all the industries labor issues what attrition initiatives alone so we’re continuing to dedicate a significant portion of our capex budget to various automation projects in the coming years our spend on automation in  was approximately  million and we expect that to increase and increase in  and  automation coupled with our lean manufacturing initiatives freed up over a  square feet of additional manufacturing space in  in q  alone leans saved about  million and freed up approximately  square feet of manufacturing capacity lean initiatives have been critical for lci as the industry has continued to grow at a record pace we are currently adding building capacity in excess of  million square feet and putting this online between q of  and q of  to handle increased demand in addition to our lean efforts to free up more space we want to thank all the people and teams here at lci for their efforts in another great quarter and we thank our customers for putting their trust in us and we’re forever grateful for these partnerships i’ll now turn to brian hall our cfo who’ll discuss the q financial results brian hall thanks jason and good morning to everyone joining us on the call over the next few minutes i will provide some additional color regarding the financial results as well as point out some highlights of our cash flows and financial position our consolidated net sales for the first quarter of  increased approximately  to a record  million  of our sales growth was organic and  came from acquisitions sales to rv oems our largest customer base also grew at  compared to the first quarter of  the rv industry continued to show strong growth as wholesale shipments of towable rvs and motorized rvs increased  and  respectively sales to other oems outside of rv grew at  to over  million for the quarter while our aftermarket segment increased sales at over  to  million for the quarter i would also note that april  sales for the aftermarket segment grew in excess of  over the prior year driven both by seasonality and new business acquired revenues were approximately  million of the  million of consolidated net sales growth consumer confidence low interest rates strong us truck sales and favorable demographics are all factors pointing to a bullish outlook for the rv industry retail sales of towable rvs are up over  when compared to the previous year we would anticipate the increase in retail to be much higher once all of the various states have reported motorized rv content per unit for the  months ended march   increased over  to  per unit while towable rv content per unit increased  to  per unit growth in furniture awnings furion and leveling were key contributors to the increases we’re even more excited about the opportunities to come such as further growth in travel trailer leveling and the release of new furion products anticipated over the next  months which have potential to add  to  of content per unit q diluted earnings per share increased to  per share compared to  per share in q of  the increase in profit resulted from incremental sales partially offset by increases in labor and material cost as jason indicated previously labor costs have increased when compared to the first half of  but they have somewhat stabilized when compared to the latter half of  these costs include increased wages as well as investments and leadership and employee talent and retention to support our future growth plans we continue to remain focused on lean automation and attrition initiatives to combat these challenges material cost primarily steel and aluminum have increased slightly during the fourth quarter of  and first quarter of  aluminum costs as an example have increased over  when compared to q of  and as a primary component for many of our products also noncash depreciation and amortization increased over  million when compared to q of  our return on investment capital remains strong at just over  on an ltm basis and reflects our team’s focus on investments with high return as mentioned in the release we adopted a new accounting standard related to employee share based payments that requires excess tax benefits related to divesting or exercise of such payments to be recognized in our income tax provision rather than in additional paid in capital or equity adoption of this new standard resulted in a discrete q tax benefit of  million our share based payments primarily invest andor exercise during the first and fourth quarters each year the company’s financial position in cash flow remain strong while using  million in cash for business acquisitions  million for capital expenditures and returning  million to shareholders in the form of dividends we end the quarter with a net cash position of  million at march   this cash position all along with the borrowing availability under our amended credit facility position us well for future investments that is the end of our prepared remarks charlotte we are ready to entertain questions thank you questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of daniel moore from cjs securities your line is now open daniel moore good morning jason scott brian and thanks for taking the questions jason lippert hi dan brian hall hi dan daniel moore you gave a lot of detail jason thank you very much i mean as it relates to a lot of the components labor costs some input cost just taking a step back looking at ebit margins that last year a huge stepup  basis points a little step back in q down to  plus just looking at fiscal  and all the puts and takes do you expect to be able to match the  ebit margin that we saw in  this year or some of those headwinds that we talked about maybe – make that a little bit more challenging jason lippert hey dan yes i think that allinall yes we feel comfortable with the  and i think we’ve made some comments on that toward either q or q last year in our call brian will give color in a minute but as you know we’re improving margins over q and q last year so we’re heading in the right track we’ve got some a little bit of headwinds we’re fighting with labor as we discussed but allinall feel like that number is obtainable brian hall yes i would add to that dan when you really go back and look at  and the overall  plus that we earned for the year q was  to q was  and then we saw some pretty sizable reduction to  and  a lot of that as we’ve discussed previously was were changes in our commodity prices the timing of when we’re putting through price reductions with our customers as well as the increasing labor costs that we were saying through the latter half of the year so when you look at  i look at q has been an improvement over the latter half of  and you should start to see some better comps as we move beyond q of  jason lippert and just to close out the question i think to just – having investment and programming and labor and attrition initiatives and everything that we’re doing that starts to recede a little bit as we get into the rest of the year so as brian said comps should get better as we get pass q daniel moore really helpful appreciate it and then getting a little bit more granular as it relates to gross margins can you give us a sense or isolate the impact of rising input costs aluminum and steel that we saw in the quarter scott mereness yes dan this is scott so in terms of material cost it definitely has been a little bit more of a headwind than the last time we spoke in terms of last earnings call first and foremost next we always talked about raw materials being involved pool and one other thing that we have to look at when raw materials go up our potential price increases so both them always match up and nice to see from quartertoquarter so you look at this first quarter this year we’re seeing some impact there primarily due to aluminum but as you see price increases going to fact and potentially that volatility mitigating we feel like we should be able to control that daniel moore got it and lastly talked about adjacent – maybe some larger acquisitions in the pipeline that obviously – do we expect to see more like sessa internationally or i’m sure you’re looking sort of across the board where is the greatest area of opportunity that you’re seeing maybe either geographically or via end market jason lippert i think because as we’ve stated so often our real growth looks to be the adjacent market category and still some in rv and some international but the greatest opportunity for us – are in the adjacent market so and that’s kind of what we’ve shown over the last two years of acquisition strategy there’s a lot of acquisitions i mean adjacent markets with marine and bus and cargo trailer and especially the vehicles and things like that so that’s kind of the focus and we would have said in the past we want to take international slow we feel we’ve got a great strategy there because it’s such a different culture and different market and everything’s a lot different than what we deal with here in the states as we’re taking that strategy – we’re taking that strategy slow but calculated scott mereness dan this is scott just one more quick comment there when you – a lot of you guys have spent a lot of time looking at the  billion slide of market opportunity but within just a reminder within the rv space of roughly  billion – just over a  billion is products that we would grow organically so when you think about it from an acquisition standpoint of the  billion and within north american rv it’s really only  million give or take and acquisition opportunity is there and then  billion in non north american rv market so definitely you could expect that the trend of non north american acquisition – non north american rv acquisition being a little bit more prevalent – are probably high just based on the numbers that we have laid out jason talked about a few new markets today that we still don’t have in the  billion market he talked about hitch market and even the cargo management market so those are things that i’ve always told people that are not in that market so we’ve got lots of upside we do now have close to  team members in europe after those two acquisitions so the first two were a little bit small but now it’s boots on the ground and leadership team in place it’s little bit easier for us look at slightly larger deals but like jason said we won’t venture too far – size wise too far from where we are at least right now we won’t in europe for sure daniel moore thank you very much and did i hear april aftermarket up  is the right number jason lippert right yes daniel moore perfect thanks gentlemen jason lippert thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kathryn thompson from thompson research your line is now open kathryn thompson hi thank you for taking my questions today just digging a little bit further into segment margins first could you just confirm that for at least the oem side labor and raw materials with a greater driver for margin compression and then second digging a little bit more into aftermarket how much of the margin compression was driven by mix labor raising raw materials or other factors we should take in consideration thank you brian hall yes i think when you look at the reduction in margins just yearoveryear q to q i look at labor and over – labor and materials within our gross margin to be somewhat equal and the driving force there of the reduction specific to aftermarket i think that what’s driving most of that would be changes in mix not  so i’d put greater weight in change and mix versus the increase in additional cost – operating cost there jason lippert and i’d add that real quick that mix is it’s always i saw as literally a mixed bag because the mix shift can change we can see more fifthwheels produce but just more entry level fifthwheels produced and not be a bigger driver as what you might think but also just to add that we’re mention we’re putting  million square feet online here in the very near future so we have a lot of investment around that in getting people and equipment and process is ready to put that online and we can just put it online in q and q all at once so we got to prepare for that and plan for that and we’re seeing some of that as well so a lot of investment in the business right now similar to  but i think the real story in terms of how  –  is going to be different than  that we’re running  attrition in  so as you can imagine it’s a much harder to deal with the growth and have the new capacity and deal with all that with  attrition and that is where we are todate just about  scott mereness kathryn this is scott i just add one more thing again when you look at margins i think like brian was just saying our quarterbyquarter margins you’ve got to look at – i think the right way to look at it would be the full year of  as compared to what we turned in for the first quarter this year     it’s largely the material tailwind started we talked about halfway through the third quarter of  and then four quarters in q q and q so these comps and the way to probably best look at it would be a full year operating margin which is  and we turned into  so i think i would encourage everybody to continue to look at it that way as opposed a great comp versus something that maybe sounds worse than it actually is jason lippert and we’ve got – just not to keep piling on but we have some materials benefit q last year with respect to materials obviously and we’re seeing the opposite of that now we didn’t set the decreases in place until midway through the second quarter last year no different than we’re not going to set the increases in place till second quarter this year so hopefully that’s helps give you an additional color kathryn thompson yes just one just clarification there you said labor and materials would roughly equal impact in the quarter is that for a consolidated or was that just for the oem segment in particular jason lippert consolidated but really oem is the larger segment kathryn thompson yes okay and just to follow the margin question and there’s a lot of talk about labor materials and mix but to what extent to have newer acquisitions over the past six to  months impacted your margin profile as you pull those into the company jason lippert i think that a lot of these adjacent that we’ve discussed this many times in the past that a lot of the – our focus on adjacent industries as well as aftermarket they tend to be favorable from a margin perspective and international seems to be a little bit different and move at slightly different phase but it’s – those are relatively small when you look at the last  to  months worth of acquisitions scott mereness i would just answer the question i don’t think acquisitions really have impacted us positively or negatively when you look at our overall book of business brian hall in the past year scott mereness in the past  to  months kathryn thompson okay perfect that’s helpful then finally on acquisitions know that you had a few comments with cjs just prior but taking just another step at this – as you look at acquisitions we know you’re more focused on aftermarket basically markets outside of your core market but with that said would you be open to taking on a larger acquisition in the industry in which you participate jason lippert with respect to the aftermarket or just… kathryn thompson aftermarket and oem i mean what’s your comfort level in terms of potential acquisition size you’d willing to take on given where we are in the cycle and your relatively clean your very clean balance sheet jason lippert yes we’ve made comments indiscernible call and others where we’re starting to look at bigger deal but they got to stick with our – we’re sticking with our discipline multiples have changed in the last  months and you get your bigger deal sides and multiples are different so we’re that filing with all that carefully but i’d expect to say that we’re looking at the deals that are larger than historical you want anything to add that scott mereness i mean i think kathryn we’ve talked in the past that our appetite for debt and leverage it’s different than other companies i still would consider our company on a forward basis if you look out over the next three to five years still fairly conservative that being said i think we’re more apt to carry a little bit of debt to fund some acquisitions and if we ventured in the neighborhood of one that – maybe even  times debt or ebitda rather that’s not something that we look at as super risky first and foremost and secondly when you look at larger acquisitions you probably will be – could potentially be getting into that type of range kathryn thompson okay that’s helpful and you gave a number for your april aftermarket sales anything in terms of the oem segment or is it just a matter of backing out the numbers that you gave for your total april number jason lippert overall we’re  so if you kind of fact of the  out of that for aftermarket kathryn thompson okay jason lippert obviously a little bit lower but wholesale was up  in march and  on the year obviously and retail still really strong and i think that again that’s a real driver and we’ve shown historically that what we’ve got a proven track record when there’s growth there to get out there we’re not only successful getting the growth but we figure out how to get efficient real quick on it and yearoveryear we get better but with   wholesale and almost  in retail with the results that we have so far for industry shipments in wholesale it’s – an industry shipments retail to get a little bit better with future month reporting so it’s a lot of good news right now kathryn thompson thank you very much jason lippert thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of craig kennison from baird your line is now open craig kennison great hey thanks for taking my question again on margin here just curious if the cost pressure you’re seeing is enough to justify a price increase and if so how does how quickly does that move through the income statement brian hall yes we’ve mentioned a couple different times we’re definitely looking not a productbyproduct customerbycustomer basis as we would normally do it and certainly we’re experiencing most of the pressure on the material side there is a lot of aluminum products labor overall that’s an issue that everybody is dealing with so the pressure is kind of equal on all sides there but typically you would see at least a quarter lag i would say before you really start to see any impact of adjustments jason lippert and craig several of our product lines are set up on kind of an index move so that index move was a look back we see those changes and future quarters after we look back scott i don’t know if you want to add anything scott mereness yes i mean those mechanisms would either be a one or two quarter look back so they do have a little bit of lag again the two primary raw material inputs that we have steel and aluminum in that order they’re volatile i mean just looking at the kerbs over the last year to year and a half they could come down just as quickly as they’ve gone up so we’re patient but at the some point in time aluminum probably has shown a little bit less volatility in terms of up and down it’s been consistently going up since the beginning of  so i think we have a little bit more focus on aluminum based products windows doors awnings aftermarket type products slide outs those types of things that carry a heavy aluminum content in their bill material craig kennison thanks and then on the capex front you’ve got a bigger agenda this year in terms of your capital priorities could you just review in a little more detail what your big plans are and where you see the most return for that spend scott mereness yes so i think brian on the last call brian had talked about  capex initial forecast in the range of  million to  million we’ve got two big projects and some other cost will for sure slip over into  so i guess i’m given it here maybe on a forward  as opposed to just calendar year  but we’ve got two projects one new building being built currently under construction in fort wayne that will consolidate to fort wayne furniture facilities and that one plant under one roof and then we have a facility in mishawaka just to the west of elkhart that would allow us to expand our aftermarket as well as furion growth do you think about furion being a distributed item obviously with that sales growth we’re going to need more warehouses in space for that product line so we’re preparing for that so the mishawaka add there would be as a way to alleviate space constraints for furion growth as well as success in the aftermarket that being said those two projects are going to exceed  million in capex money on combined and again that would be expected over the next  to  months give or take so those are out of the  million to  million those are the two biggest projects that we have we’ve got some other big ones but those definitely would be some of the big ones and again talk about when we add building it sometimes carries a step function so you look at the last time we added aftermarket space was back in beginning of  where three years later we’re talking about adding that furion is coming up on it’s twoyear birthday in july in terms of when we went deal so we’re two years into that and now needing some space there and then our furniture plant in fort wayne is a labor play as well as a capacity play so we’re trying to move slightly outside of the elkhart county market to deal with the tightening labor market but we often need space due to the success of the marine furniture market that we’re having in that space as well as adding some additional redeem capacity for our rv furniture that’s located in goshen craig kennison thanks and lastly on that furion comment you made could you just share more detail on how you see that relationship unfolding on next let’s say  to  months scott mereness well from a space standpoint so we’ve just been reviewing in the last couple days and it’s all based on how successful the products are but products upgrade the cost upgrade we got commitments from our customers and again these are products that carry quite a bit of content per vehicle in terms of dollars but they’re also quite large so that means that we’ve got to be prepared from a spaces and logistics standpoint but the  million market opportunity within the furion group of products is out there and i think we’ve commented on past calls that we have relatively low market share not zero but closer to zero than  million so lots of upside and we’ve got to be prepared for that growth and so with the building add in mishawaka that’s really a part of that preparation for the growth jason lippert and i would add craig on that we’re super excited about the furion line of products i mean they have done everything that they said they’re going to do and provide us new product opportunities and product development we’ve got several new products coming on line excuse me by the end of the year and right now i think we’re in the – out of the  in content we feel there is through other product offerings that they’re going to put online over the next couple of years we’re in maybe  range they are opening up their innovation center here on may  and so  million facility that that’s going to be able to showcase kitchens and electronics products and all the different products that they’re going to launch – do a big launch for our customers and the public in couple weeks so we will able to talk a lot more about products that are going to add significant content in the next  months by the next earnings call scott mereness yes craig just a clarification because i know in the speeches and what not we talk about the furion content over x amount of months or years when you look at  million on  units the math there is it’s different than some of the numbers quoted so i just want to make sure everybody understands that what we quoted today is kind of that nearterm expectation it’s not necessarily the full potential but we’re being conservative when we talk about a few  or  to  as opposed to – it changes on a regular basis and we’ve got – all markets for that so we’ve got aftermarket we’ve got cargo trailers sequestering trailers buses marine we can put – we can put furion products into most of the markets that we’ve – that we’ve gotten our adjacent craig kennsion got it thank you jason lippert thanks craig operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve o’hara from sidoti  company your line is now open steve o’hara yes hi good morning jason lippert hi there steve o’hara hi just question maybe you address – i had some connectivity issues but can you just talk about the difference in the tax rate you mean it seems like it’s pretty common this quarter was there offset in sga – i mean if you look at the cash flow statement it looks like there’s a few noncash items that hit and i’m just wondering if that was above the line or below the line and maybe that’s contributed to maybe some of the margin pressure scott mereness right now steve there’s not any additional cost that’s offsetting up in the sga line i mean you do have increases in stock based compensation slightly yearoveryear but it’s not offsetting that  million benefit that’s running through the income tax line this year or so it really not to bore everyone with the details of the gap but i will because it’s my world but it’s really just the appreciation in the market value of our stock versus the value that the stockbased compensation is reflected through our pl so as our stock prices is went up it creates more of a benefit and that in – historically it always went through equity and now it’s running through the income tax line steve o’hara okay so the  million that’s on the cash flow statement that was in the tax line scott mereness yes steve o’hara okay all right thank you and then i just hate to just beat the dead horse here but on the april sales growth number i mean i think it was lower than maybe the january number i don’t know if that’s a seasonal issue or and it sounded like there were some of the components of the total number were a bit higher i mean what your confidence level that that’s not a bad number going forward how do you feel about that jason lippert i think it’s just a testament that the industries continuing strong i think there’s a day short on this april versus last april and that has a significant impact obviously if where days different but on a quarter of value have been out and like i said in our initial comments that the oems are rolling they are adding new plan some up every month we’ve got grand design jayco all the store facilities motorhomes towable are like for force driver they’re all adding plans right now for there’s new capacity coming on line and wholesale is strong and retail is strong so we’re just trying to deal with the growth the best we can given all the other constraints and challenges there are with labor and other things and the investments that we’re making but like i said its lot easier to deal with these great problems with a much lower attrition number than we’ve historically dealt with steve o’hara okay i think that will do it thank you jason lippert thanks dan steve sorry operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of daniel moore from cjs securities your line is now open daniel moore thanks again a quick capital allocation question that i’m probably know the answer too but i’ll ask it anyway you’ve always favor dividend specials in the past now were regular and the occasional special but we have the sort of bifurcation in what’s going on in the industry versus the fear of the cycle and it creates a little bit more volatility around your stock and i’m just wondering if you might think about adding buybacks to the mix to be opportunistic given your obviously continued positive outlook going forward just any thoughts there scott mereness it’s certainly something that we consider on a regular basis with our board we’ve looked at the opportunity versus where we see the value of our stock and will continue to do so daniel moore fair enough appreciate it jason lippert thanks dan operator thank you and at this time i’m not showing any further questions i would like to turn the call back over to jason lippert for any closing remarks jason lippert i just want to thank everybody for being on the call today and stay

supplier already has a large presence in northern indiana but its still in a growth modewith about  employees in indiana and  nationwide lippert components or lci already operates at  locations in elkhart county and now one in south bend it is adding employees in both goshen and south bend the latter at the former aj wright building which the company recently announced it will lease for the next   yearslippert components a subsidiary of drew industries has been on a rapid growth curve over the past several years kinro composites consolidated into lippert components inc in the past year all operating under lci said jason lippert ceo of both drew industries and lippert componentswhat follows is an interview with jason lippertqyou plan to hire workers for the new south bend operation this year when does that start will there be a job faira the  jobs is the total commitment for the facility including bimbo bakeries logistic company which is subletting the facility from lippert we are looking forward to doing our part to meet our commitment we will immediately begin equipping the south bend building and hiring employees for warehousing distribution and light manufacturing operationsqwhat were some of the main reasons you chose the south bend location and decided to further expand in the areaa we believe the south bend facility will allow us to better serve our customers both inside and outside of elkhart county the facility is a great facility  its truly a beautiful building and provides great space for warehousing and light manufacturing a larger facility such as this one allows us to consolidate operations to improve efficiency and have room for future growth additionally expanding into south bend allows us to diversify our work force and tap into a new pool of talent when the rv industry gets very busy like it is now every rv manufacturer as well as other employers benefiting from the improved economy in elkhart county taps into a relatively small work forceq do you think the industry can sustain its current growth pattern and whya the rv industry has performed quite well over the past few years based on solid retail sales in  and industry expectations for  we believe that the rv industry is strong many of our rv customers are introducing new product lines and offering new features on existing lines as well as increasing production capacity to meet projected industrywide growth for  and beyond while nothing is certain we have no reason to believe that the industry will not continue to do well in the coming years as an industry we know that rv products are appealing to more people in different demographics than ever before the popularity of traveling in rvs to nascar and other sporting events more familyoriented domestic vacations and using rvs as second homes appear to motivate consumer demand for rvs its not just the baby boom generation thats buying rvs rvs are also appealing to younger and younger buyers every yearq how do you see lippert components doing over the next five years and whya while we dont give projections as we look forward particularly at  we are optimistic about opportunities for continued growth lci has grown from approximately  million in net sales in  to over  billion in net sales in  to continue this level of growthwe intend to continue to invest in our business focusing on growth in existing products and developing new and innovative products diversifying into adjacent markets and the aftermarket for our products strengthening customer and employee relationships as well as continuing to seek growth through acquisitions over the last few years we have increased our focus on the aftermarket for our products by creating dedicated sales and distribution capabilities developing new relationships and creating innovative packaging sales growth in new markets will also continue to be an important factor adjacent markets include cargo and utility trailers horse trailers buses trucks as well as modular homes and mobile office units and many of our products are well suited for those markets we also recently hired a director of international business development who is spending time in australia europe and other international markets to help us explore opportunities abroad we will also continue to invest in research and developmentfinally we will continue to be acquisitive we have made many acquisitions in the last  years and have already made two this year acquisitions bring many different opportunities to lippert and our customersqwhat makes the area so conducive to the rv industry in hindsight how has the decision to locate drew industries corporate headquarters in elkhart worked outa the people are what make this industry the manufacturers and suppliers are some of the most determined business people and entrepreneurs in the country ive been around the country and visited a lot of businesses and have friends and acquaintances all over the country and ive havent found many businesses or industries that can hold a candle to the passion drive and entrepreneurial spirit that is the elkhart county rv business ive been in the business now for  years and can tell you that not only are the people of this community driven and passionate toward the rv business but they are the best people ive ever met generosity and commitment to the community and charity runs everywhere i think what makes us successful as an industry is that unlike a lot of other sizable manufacturing industries it primarily exists all in one community here in elkhart and because all the rv businesses are so close to each other in proximity we are able to communicate face to face and find solutions to businesses challenges and help each other on a regular and frequent basis we see our customers face to face every day because most of our customers are right heretake five is an occasional feature of tribune business well ask five
