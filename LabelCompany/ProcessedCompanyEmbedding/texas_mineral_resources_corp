chemical physical and optical properties often included in this group is yttrium which not only possesses similar characteristics to rees but is also frequently contained within the same mineral deposits although the elements themselves are found widely dispersed in the earth’s crust economic deposits are a rarity these elements are only found with other rees and do not occur individually source callahan michael psuedu web blog httpwwwpersonalpsuedumjcexttexthtml   rare earth facts rees enable many of the world’s most advanced technologies serving as key components in mankind’s quest for electronics miniaturization energy efficiency environmental stewardship and technological advancement while rees have long played an underlying role in technology development recent attention to global supplydemand dynamics and overall industry structure has brought their importance to the forefront about  percent of all rees are produced in china this has raised concern around the world particularly as china has taken steps to curb production–and exports–of these key elements   global rare earth oxidereo production trends source gambogi joseph “global rare earth oxide reo production trends” us geological survey  april  web httpmineralsusgsgovmineralspubscommodityrareearthsreetrendspdf   rees include the following cerium dysprosium erbium europium gadolinium holmium lanthanum lutetium neodymium praseodymium promethium samarium scandium terbium thulium ytterbium yttrium   light vs heavy rare earths rees are often divided into light rare earth elements lrees and heavy rare earth elements hrees based on their chemical properties globally lrees are more abundant than hrees according to published sources particularly in economic quantities and concentrations as a result hrees tend to be far more valuable rees are integral to many common electronics such as cell phones and laptop computers during the past  years many new applications for rees have been developed and there has been an increase in demand for many items that require rare earth elements for example nickelmetal hydride nimh rechargeable batteries are made with rare earth compounds these batteries are found in items that range from handheld electronics to hybrid and electric vehicles rare earth elements are also used in in flat screen displays energy efficient lighting lasers and fiberoptic communication systems typically rees are present only in small quantities large deposits like texas mineral resources’ round top project in hudspeth county texas are rare   learn more about trer

presentation press releases texas mineral resources signs mou with pennsylvania coal company to recover and produce scandium and rare earth byproducts from coal ash and coal overburden sierra blanca tx—marketwired july   – texas mineral resources corp otcqx tmrc  us department of energy data suggests potentially significant amounts of scandium and       rare earth byproducts are present both coal ash and insitu coal overburden have been outlined as potential resources preliminary internal economic analysis of a coal ash project suggests modest capex requirements along with profitability tmrc to establish scandium america corp subsidiary upon signing definitive agreement texas mineral resources corp tmrc an exploration company targeting the heavy rare earths and a variety of other highvalue elements and industrial minerals is pleased to announce that it has signed a memorandum of understanding mou with a wellestablished privatelyheld pennsylvania coal company  the mou gives tmrc a sixmonth period of time to further evaluate the potential to finance recover and produce scandium and other rare earth byproducts from their properties the national energy technology laboratory of the department of energy has recently conducted studies at the properties that are the subject of this mou suggesting the existence of potentially valuable rare earth and scandium mineralization in coal ash being deposited at several locations on the property and in the insitu coal bed overburden at different sites on company property  tonnages of the ash repositories are well documented  the area chosen for initial study because of its favorable location contains  million short tons of coal ash a total of three ash repositories and an as yet undetermined number of insitu overburden deposits lend themselves to simultaneous development the property is fully permitted for mining and processing of coal  only the additional permitting for scandium and rare earth processing would be needed with respect to the coal ash deposit preliminary internal economic analysis done by tmrc of a modest startup operation processing  tons of coal ash per day suggests that it would require an estimated capex of approximately  million inclusive of a  contingency  assuming a recoverable grade of  ppm parts per million scandium content potential estimated production of scandium oxide would approximate  kilograms per year  using a current scandium oxide market price of kg could potentially result in pretax cash flow of approximately  million after operating costs and royalty payments to the coal company  these assumptions assume that only the recovered scandium would be sold attributing no value to the rare earth and other elements and minerals that could be recovered additionally the coal company has a large database of drill hole and outcrop sampling that indicates potential for extensive rare earth and scandium value in the rocks overlying the unmined coal research conducted on overburden from other properties in the region and published by a group from pennsylvania state university suggests that the rock overburden can be successfully leached with several different organic solvents with encouraging recoveries the drill and outcrop data suggest that the insitu overburden rock contains higher scandium values than the coal ash thus offsetting the potentially higher costs of mining crushing and grinding it “while our round top deposit remains the flagship property of the company we are very pleased to be able to start parallel examination of a series of deposits potentially profitable at current scandium prices that offer the possibility of being brought to production more rapidly and at a fraction of the cost of round top a significant portion of the process development work we plan to undertake for the coal related deposits will be applicable to feasibility work required by round top ”  dan gorski ceo added  anthony marchese chairman further commented  “worldwide scandium production is limited and industry demand is growing domestic manufacturers need a large and reliable source of scandium oxide  we believe joining forces with a well established pennsylvania coal company for the potential recovery of scandium and other valuable rare earth minerals is a perfect complement to our round top heavy rare earth project  the potential benefits of such a project will be felt in the surrounding coal community as well as by tmrc shareholders  in recognition of the potential significance of a longterm domestic source of scandium oxide we plan to establish a new subsidiary titled scandium america corp upon the signing of a definitive agreement with the domestic coal company at which time further details of the agreement will be released”

v pisupati ems energy institute and john and willie leone family department of energy and mineral engineering the pennsylvania state university    background on scandium global scandium production is estimated to be between  to  kilograms annually  most of today’s production tends to come as a byproduct of the leaching activity associated with production of other metals minerals or rare earths the united states is  importdependent for scandium   according to the usgs us geological survey scandiumbearing minerals have not been mined nor recovered from mine tailings since   principal sources of scandium today include china kazakhstan russia and the ukraine freedom house a us based non partisan organization that conducts research and advocacy on democracy political freedom and human rights  currently ranks the first three sources as “not free” and the last as “partially free” principal uses of scandium today are for the production of solid oxide fuel cells lasers switches and mercury vapor high intensity lamps  future significant growth is forecast in the metallurgical market as highstrength alloys of aluminum  when used in combination with other common aluminum alloys scandium can produce lighter stronger more corrosion resistant heat tolerant and weldable aluminum products it is believed that use of aluminumscandium alloys can reduce aircraft weight by   likewise automotive applications are large potential markets  one industry source estimates that if only a tiny fraction  of the annual aluminum market absorbed scandium in alloy at a  level it would represent a potential  kilograms of scandium demand about texas mineral resources corp texas mineral resources corps primary focus is exploring and if warranted developing its round top heavy rare earth and

statements made in this press release the analysis is preliminary in nature and is subject to risks and uncertainties including actual costs of mining being higher than estimated actual recovery rates being lower than estimated capex and opex costs being different than initially estimated changes in costs of materials and labor changes in the market for scandium all of which could result in lower production and reduced cash flow the internal analysis was subject to many assumptions including assumptions regarding processing rate recovery rates the market price of scandium and estimates of capex costs and opex costs the internal analysis is not a feasibility study and investors should not assume that the project is legally or economically mineable on the basis of the preliminary

business with the recent establishment of a subsidiary named american mineral reclamation llc the formation of this subsidiary is in response to the growing number of opportunities that tmrc has been presented as a result of work undertaken with partners that has resulted in winning grants from the department of defense defense logistics agency and the department of energy american mineral reclamation along with industrial partners is currently evaluating projects whose goal is the reclamation of highvalue elements and industrial minerals from both liquid and solid waste material there are multiple benefits to developing such projects  technology now exists to recover these materials in a potentially costefficient and profitable manner  capital expenditures are typically significantly less than traditional comparable mining projects seeking the same material  reclamation can focus on low cost feedstocks as identified by american mineral reclamation that can serve as bases for production of multiple strategic and critical metals  a large number of projects involving waste material are available domestically and  reclamation projects offer significant potential to protect the environment enrich land and water quality and contribute to public health and safety  an example of just one such project is the recovery of scandium and other rare earth elements from coal waste in the pennsylvania region the us department of energy recently awarded a consortium assembled by tmrc which included inventure renewables ktech and penn state university a phase one grant of  million dollars with potential for phase two funding up to  million for the construction of a pilot plant to produce saleable rare earth oxides to be located in central pennsylvania in addition tmrc is currently evaluating projects in the following areas environmentallyfriendly process improvements for byproduct water from the unconventional oil and gas industry recovery of rare earth minerals from acid mine drainage and recovery of cobalt and rhenium from military scrap metal tmrc is also pleased to announced that it has signed a cooperation agreement with inventure renewables inc of tuscaloosa alabama wwwinventurechemcom one of its project partners for the recent department of energy grant inventure renewables pioneers process technologies for the rapid lowcost high yield extraction of natural biochemical and material building blocks from lowvaluewaste biomass to provide costeffective carbon neutral biofuels biochemicals and biomaterials inventure renewables along with ktech wwwktechinccom penn state university wwwemspsuedu and additional industrial partners will play a key role in the evaluation and development of future reclamation projects dan gorski ceo commented the success of ktechs ion exchange and ion chromatographic methodology to process the leach solution from round top rock into separated high purity ree products led us to examine the possibility of employing it at other projects and in other sectors our work with the defense logistics agency brought us into contact with the research being sponsored by the department of energy to recover the rare earth and other strategic elements that are associated with the appalachian coal deposits teaming with ktech inventure renewables and penn state university we applied for and received a grant from the department of energy to identify and develop one of these coalbedrelated deposits the opportunity to further extend this technology into the removal and recovery of various elements from both acid mine drainage and from flow back and production waters in oil and gas development has opened what we think is an exceptional development opportunity for tmrc in too many instances us advanced manufacturing  and advanced defense systems  depend on metals and minerals for which the us is deeply dependent on questionable foreign supply said anthony marchese chairman as we work to bring our multimetal round top heavy rare earth deposit into production we now see a new distinct line of business by partnering with entities to develop projects which reclaim and recover critical materials from many different lowcost feedstocks that would normally be considered waste material  coal overburden mine waste ewaste and industrial scrap as well as waste water and acid mine drainage

small quantities in the old heath gold prospect in llano county no bismuth has been produced commercially in texas bleaching clay bentonite clays that are commonly used as bleaching clays and fullers earth occur at numerous localities in tertiary formations of the coastal plain and deposits on the high plains bleaching clays are used for refining petroleum products and to a lesser extent for refining vegetable oils texas bleaching clays are currently produced in fayette and gonzales counties brines brines containing strong concentrations of mineral salts occur in a variety of geological conditions in widely separated areas of texas shallow brines occur in broad shallow basins usually occupied in part by one or more saline playas or alkaline lakes surface and seep waters draining into the playas undergo rapid natural evaporation resulting in the concentration of salts leached from soils and rocks of the drainage area shallow brines are produced for sodium sulfate in gaines and terry counties brine reservoirs containing salts of sodium calcium magnesium potassium and other elements are present in the permian basin these aquifers lie at considerable depth and have not been produced commercially for their salts in transpecos texas shallow brines containing mainly common salt and gypsum occur in the salt basin in northern culberson and hudspeth counties highly gypsiferous

in saliferous tertiary formations not related to salt domes bromine bromine is extracted from seawater at freeport in brazoria county caliche caliche occurs abundantly in surface and nearsurface deposits in the semiarid and arid parts of texas and is particularly abundant in the high plains and the outcrop belt of the goliad formation of south texas a large quantity of caliche is produced chiefly for road construction from numerous and widespread localities celestite celestite is known at numerous localities particularly in the cretaceous glen rose formation and the upper permian whitehorse formation in north and north central texas respectively these occurrences are small and have no commercial value extensive deposits of celestite are present in brown and nolan counties small quantities of celestite were produced from these counties during the late s and early s most of the celestite produced in texas has been used as a weighting agent in rotarydrilling fluids cement limestone and clay are the principal components used in the manufacture of cement iron ore and gypsum are also used in smaller amounts cement is currently produced in bexar comal dallas ector ellis el paso harris hays mclennan nolan nueces potter and tarrant counties portland cement output rose slightly during  to a total of  million short tons with a value of  million historically the states portland cement output has accounted for about  percent of the annual united states production texas usually has been ranked first or second among the thirtyeight producing states in  texas was ranked second behind california masonry cement continued its fiveyear downtrend and output was estimated at less than half of that in  declines in texas construction industries generally have caused a decrease in demand for portland cement texas portland cement production was up  tons over that of  but was still lower than the  production the demand for masonry cement has fallen every year since a record high of  short tons in  clay texas has an abundance of various types of clays occurring in many geologic units production includes ball clay bentonite common clay and shale fire clay fullers earth and kaolin texas is one of the leading producers of clays in the united states ceramic products include structural building brick paving brick decorative tile drain tile and expanded clay for lightweight aggregate common clay suitable for the manufacture of cement or common brick is found in many counties clays suitable for ceramic and refractory ware contain a high proportion of kaolin and are found primarily in northeastern texas nonceramic clays are used as bleaching or adsorbent clays fillers coaters additives bonding clays drilling muds and catalysts most nonceramic products are produced from bentonites that are found primarily in the coastal plain kaolin clays found in east texas are used as paper coaters and fillers and rubber fillers highpurity kaolin clays have a high alumina content and are a potential source of metallic aluminum coal bituminous coal of pennsylvanian age occurs primarily in coleman eastland erath jack mcculloch montague palo pinto parker throckmorton wise and young counties of north central texas bituminous coal deposits are also found in cretaceous deposits of the olmos formation in maverick county and in eocene age cannel coal deposits in webb county these coals provided a significant energy source prior to the development of oil and gas in the s mines in these areas were inactive from the early s until the s when high petroleum prices prompted a revaluation of the texas coal deposits limited bituminous coal production in these areas was resumed during the late s a decline in demand during the late s resulted in the closing of the north texas coal mines the mines in webb county reduced production but were still in operation in  cretaceous bituminous coals in transpecos texas have little potential for development as a fuel they have been marketed primarily as a soil conditioner leonardite commercial mining for coal and lignite started in the late s the first year coal production was listed for texas was  when  short tons was mined production declined from  to  it subsequently climbed at a high rate to  short tons in  then gradually increased to a high of about  million tons in  after that year coal and lignite production gradually declined annual production fell below one million short tons in  and below  short tons in  production of bituminous coal ceased in  production of lignite continued but declined drastically during the early s coal and lignite were mined primarily by underground methods until the s in the mids the industry received a tremendous boost when aluminum company of america started using char produced from lignite at its plant near rockdale in  estimated lignite production exceeded a million short tons the production of lignite by stripmining methods and the utilization of lignite to fuel minemouth generators for the production of electricity caused texas to become a major coal lignite producer during the s coal production in texas now exceeds fifty million short tons annually copper copper deposits in texas occur in the transpecos region in the permian red beds of north central texas and in the llano region mining has been attempted at different times on the deposits in each region most of the states small production has been from the van hornallamoore mining district whereas only small shipments of copper have been reported from the north texas and llano regions the last reported copper production was eighteen tons in  valued at  most of the ore came from the old hazel mine in culberson county during the mid s however most of the texas copper mines were inoperative large deposits of ore exist in north texas but have not been developed because of their low metal content copper refineries operate in el paso and potter counties copper smelters are operating in plants at amarillo el paso and texas city these depend upon imported ore from arizona chile new mexico and mexico to produce refined copper copper anode copper sulfate and other copper products diatomite diatomite or diatomaceous earth occurs in the upper tertiary and pleistocene lacustrine deposits on the high plains no texas diatomite has been produced dolomite dolomite is widely distributed in texas except in the coastal plain and over the greater part of the high plains it occurs in beds of varying thickness and extent in rocks ranging from precambrian to cretaceous in age dolomite was mined from the ellenburger formation in burnet county as an ore of magnesium during the s it was processed in the austin plant of international minerals and chemical company and the mathieson alkali works lake charles louisiana the ellenburger dolomites are now used by dow chemical at freeport in brazoria county as a part of a process of removing magnesium from sea water dolomites from the edwards formation are used as a source of crushed stone evaporites evaporites including rock salt gypsum potassium minerals and other similar compounds occur extensively in permian deposits that underlie the greater part of the high plains and parts of adjacent regions the evaporite compounds of west texas are not being produced although potash is mined extensively in the vicinity of carlsbad new mexico salt anhydrite and gypsum occur in the salt domes of the coastal plain these minerals except anhydrite are considered separately feldspar feldspar occurs in precambrian formations in parts of the llano and transpecos regions during the s it was produced from pegmatite dikes in llano and culberson counties and used in the manufacture of pottery ceramics and glassware feldspars are not currently being produced in texas fluorspar fluorspar or fluorite is an important industrial mineral used in the manufacture of steel aluminum glass and fluorocarbons it occurs at several localities in the transpecos and llano regions of texas transpecos deposits are commonly associated with tertiary volcanics and cretaceous limestones mining operations first started in  at eagle mountainqv in hudspeth county occurrences of fluorspar have also been found in the quitman mountains of hudspeth county the chinati mountains of presidio county the franklin mountains of el paso county and the christmas mountainsqqv and other areas of brewster county the fluorspar in the llano region occurs in pegmatite dikes and lenses and veins in precambrian schists and gneisses none of the deposits in texas are currently being produced gemstones collecting gem rock and mineral specimens has attracted numerous fans rockhounds and has proved quite profitable agate jasper cinnabar fluorite topaz calcite opal petrified wood and tektites are stones that are commonly collected by lapidarists no records are available on the quantities of gemstones collected and sold each year gold gold mining has not been extensive in texas since the occurrence of the metal is limited main production confined to the presidio and hazel mines in west texas and the heath mine in the llano region amounted to a total of  fine ounces by  valued at  most of the gold produced has come as the byproduct of silver and copper ores but traces of it occur in the shafter van horn allamore and ouitman mountains and in howard taylor irion uvalde and williamson counties with other rocks and ores the last reported gold production was from the presidio mine in  graphite deposits of fineflake graphite occur in the precambrian packsaddle schist in the llano region graphite was previously produced in burnet county greensand greensand or glauconite sand occurs in upper cambrian rocks in the llano region and in the midway weches and other eocene formations in the texas coastal plain greensand has been used in the past as a soil conditioner and in purifying water it is not currently produced commercially in texas grinding pebbles pebbles suitable for use in grinding mills occur in widely distributed surface deposits along the interior margin of the southern and southwestern coastal plain they have been produced in bastrop colorado fayette frio and gonzales counties however modern grinding methods have eliminated the demand for grinding pebbles and there is no current production of these materiels guano bat guano occurs in numerous caverns in the edwards plateau and in the transpecos region and to a more limited extent in central texas guano has been produced in edwards medina real and other counties no current production is known in texas gypsum gypsum is widely distributed and extensively developed in texas the main occurrences are  in the blaine and other permian formations that crop out east of the high plains current mining from these extensive bedded deposits occurs in fisher hardeman and nolan counties  in the permian castile gypsum that crops out in large areas between the delaware and apache mountainsqqv and pecos river in culberson and reeves counties  in rocks of probable permian age in the vicinity of the malone mountains in hudspeth county  in the

including siderite and the limonitegroup minerals are present in the eocene weches formation in northeastern texas deposits are present in anderson camp cass cherokee harrison henderson marion morris nacogdoches smith and upshur counties deposits in cherokee and henderson counties are mined chiefly as a source of iron for the manufacture of cement several deposits of iron ore minerals are present in central texas such as the magnetite deposits at iron mountain in llano county and the hematitic sandstone deposits in llano mason mcculloch and san saba counties hematite also is present in the transpecos lead and zinc lead and zinc are commonly considered together because they are generally associated in mineral deposits these metals occur in small deposits in texas and much of their past production has been as a byproduct in the production of silver a large part of the lead was obtained as a minor product of silverlead ores taken from the presidio mine in presidio county practically all of the states zinc production and an approximately equivalent amount of lead was produced from the bonanza and alice ray mines in hudspeth county from ores with a small silver content lead and zinc are also present in the quitman mountains southwest of sierra blanca in hudspeth county and in the apache mountains in culberson county lead deposits are known at several localities in cambrian strata in blanco burnet and gillespie counties in central texas the only reported production from the central texas area was in  from the pavitte prospect in western burnet county lead and zinc are not currently produced in texas and have not been mined in the state since  between  and  the total lead production in texas amounted to  short tons and the total zinc production was  short tons lead was formerly produced as a byproduct of silver mining mainly from the presidio mine in presidio county and the bird mine in brewster county zinc production had come chiefly from the bonanza and alice ray mines in hudspeth county with small amounts also from the chinati and montezuma mines in presidio county and the buck prospect in culberson county although no longer a producer of lead and zinc texas had a primary smelter that produced lead and zinc in el paso county until the mids the ore came from western states and mexico lignite lignite or brown coal occurs in extensive deposits in the eocene wilcox and claiborne groups of the texas coastal plain the wilcox group contains the largest reserves and highest quality lignite the principal resource area is north of the colorado river in central and east texas lignite was first mined in texas during the s and was produced primarily from underground mines lignite production declined during the s and early s when oil and gas supplies became readily available recovery of the texas coalmining industry began in the s when stripmining techniques were first used to mine texas lignite and provide a feed stock to minemouth electrical generators texas is now the nations sixthlargest coal producer with estimated recoverable nearsurface reserves at depths of less than  feet and seam thicknesses of three or more feet of twentythree billion short tons lignite is currently utilized at electrical generators in atascosa bastrop freestone grimes harrison hopkins limestone panola rusk and titus counties it is also produced in harrison county as a source of activated carbon deepbasin lignite resources  to  feet deep are approximately equal to nearsurface lignite resources these resources can be developed by the process of in situ gasification lime limestones which are abundant in many parts of texas are utilized in the manufacture of lime they are crushed and calcined to drive off the excess carbon dioxide and convert the calcium carbonate to calcium oxide see limekilns uses of lime include soil stabilization water purification paper and pulp manufacture metallurgy sugar refining agriculture construction and removal of sulfur from power plant stack gases plants for the production of lime are currently operating in bexar bosque burnet comal deaf smith hill johnson nueces and travis counties magnesite magnesite occurs

precambrian rocks in mason and llano counties at several localities in cretaceous and quaternary deposits in val verde county in lower cretaceous deposits in jeff davis county and in triassic sandstones in dickens county small quantities of manganese have been mined from the deposits in jeff davis county but no production has been reported since the mids mercury mercury mineral deposits occur in the terlingua district of southern brewster and southeastern presidio counties where mining was initiated in  during the early s texas was one of the nations leading producers of mercury the sharp reduction in price and demand after world war ii caused the closure of all texas mercury mines a rise in price during the s caused sporadic mining activity in the area record high prices for mercury in the middle to late s prompted renewed interest in the area that resulted in the reopening of several mines and the discovery of new reserves all of the mines closed in the early s when prices again declined no production has been reported since  mica mica is present in precambrian pegmatite dikes on the western side of the van horn mountains in western culberson county and also in precambrian schists and pegmatites in the llano region some mica has been produced in the past from the culberson county area but production is no longer active mineral water water containing high concentrations of salts and bitterns has been extracted from a variety of groundwater horizons mineral water has been produced at mineral wells in palo pinto county near marlin in falls county at milford in ellis county and at thorndale in williamson county no production of mineral waters is currently reported molybdenum deposits of molybdenum minerals have been found in brewster culberson

processed at plants in bexar dallas el paso guadalupe harris and nolan counties phosphate small quantities of phosphate rock are present in paleozoic formations in west and central texas upper cretaceous and tertiary deposits in northeastern texas also contain lenses of rock phosphate no phosphate is mined in texas but imported phosphate rock is processed at a plant in brownsville potash potash minerals including polyhalite are found in extensive deposits in permian strata in parts of west texas after world war i a search for potash sources conducted by state and federal agencies resulted in the development of highgrade potash rock containing sylvite and other potash minerals in new mexico texas potash deposits are of a lower grade and have not been developed pumicite volcanic ash or pumicite occurs in numerous deposits in some of the tertiary formations of the texas coastal plain particularly in the catahoula and jackson formations other tertiary ash deposits occur in

the strategically vital heavy rare earth elements present in the round top ore now permits us to begin to examine the production and marketing of the variety of other elements that are leached from the rhyolite the name change to texas mineral resources corp will help us better communicate this significant broadening of the base of the company that we feel will significantly add to the value of our round top project to potential partners and investors said dan gorski ceoin addition to the heavy rare earth minerals potentially produced tmrc has reported in prior press releases the following

development and production at its round top project ug usa has a right of first refusal on any quantities beyond the initial  poundsas reported previously careful review of the  column leach tests

awarded a research contract by the united states defense logistics agency dla strategic materials division to demonstrate at the bench scale the ability to separate and refine yttrium y oxide to a minimum of  purity ytterbium yb oxide to a minimum of  purity and a third rare earth oxide which is not being publicly disclosed to a minimum  purity level using cixcic we are pleased to report we are nearing successful completion of the project at the specified purities and we expect to announce more details in the near futurewhile the production of heavy rare earths remains the primary objective at round top the deposit is truly polymetallic said dan gorski ceo as we complete our assessment of the total potential of the deposit the numerous other minerals potentially being recovered in leaching of this rock are proving to make a significant contribution to the potential revenue stream based upon current established industrial mineral pricing the total revenue potential of the mineral byproducts may exceed that of the rare earth minerals at current internal chinese pricing unlike rare earth minerals the industrial minerals we plan to recover are readily marketable within the united states and around the world our existing infrastructure includes a rail yard within three miles of our deposit thus enabling us to ship product anywhere in the united states for domestic or
