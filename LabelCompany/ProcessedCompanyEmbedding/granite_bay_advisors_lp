hire a financial advisor in granite bay ca  there are no legal requirements in granite bay requiring individuals to use a financial advisor however that doesnt mean it isnt a good idea the decision to hire a financial advisor or not ultimately comes down to three primary criteria expertise time and money managing all aspects of your finances is far from simple top financial advisors spend years studying and passing exams to become experts at their craft and while not required be on the lookout for certain designations like cfp cfa and chfc when considering advisors they let you know that an independent authority has validated the advisors expertise in the areas covered by the certification managing your finances is timeconsuming you should consider carefully whether this is where you want to spend your free time if not wealthminder can help you easily find a granite bay ca financial advisor to meet your needs hiring a financial advisor is not free however a great financial advisor should be able to articulate the value you will receive from their services and should over the long run pay for their fees many times over spend some time thinking about the longterm cost of not hiring an advisor instead of only looking at the shortterm costs  fees how important is licensing for financial advisors in california  financial advisors in granite bay ca are required to register with the sec the state or both wealthminders directory only contains advisors who are properly registered as independent advisor representatives iars and this information is updated on a periodic basis the rules for becoming an iar vary by state but advisors have to pass some combination of the following  exams before they can register series  series  and series  never hire an advisor who isnt properly registered with the regulators as they are not legally allowed to provide financial advice wealthminder also keeps track of complaints people register with the regulators and you can find this information on every advisors page you should get several bids before hiring a financial advisor before hiring a granite bay ca financial advisor be sure to get at least  detailed proposals quality financial advisors will take the time to explain their proposal detailing both what they will do for you and how you will be charged be wary of an abnormally low proposal they are not worth the risk these underpriced proposals often come with hidden fees or subpar advice choose an advisor you trust and can clearly communicate with wealthminder has made the proposal process extremely simple and free just click here to get started why you should hire an advisor through wealthminder wealthminder is here to make the process simple and transparent for you you take a few minutes of your time to describe what you want help with we then pass your request on to the advisors in our network if they are interested in your business they will respond with an initial proposal you then compare the proposals ask followup questions hold an initial consultation with the advisors whose proposals you like and ultimately hire the one that best meets your needs to participate in the proposal process advisors must be legal fiduciaries this means they have to look out for your best interest agree to submit feeonly proposals no kickbacks on the investment products they recommend with the exception of insurance because insurance can currently only be sold on commission and have no blackmarks with the regulators financial recourse when hiring an advisor in california california
