eu labeling move officials from israel and the palestine liberation organization disagreed on whether the european union should label goods from israeli settlements and a factory manager spoke out against the move publish date november   photo by baz ratnerreuters watch in times video » embed jerusalem — in a stinging rebuke to israel the european union insisted on wednesday that some goods produced on land seized in the  war must be labeled “made in settlements” a mandate that added to israel’s deep unease over a growing international boycotteuropean officials tried to play down the decision saying the guidelines merely clarified existing rules but the move exacerbated already simmering tensions between israel and europe as israeli politicians condemned it as an echo of the holocaustera branding of european jews and their storefronts with yellow starsthe european union is israel’s top trading partner though products from the occupied west bank the golan heights and east jerusalem that will now require special labels amount to less than  percent of israel’s  billion in annual exports to the bloc’s  countries but while the immediate economic impact is expected to be minimal there is fear that the logic behind the labeling could be extended to the broader economy by targeting businesses that have operations or affiliates in the contested areas as many dofor example israeli banks that provide mortgages to homeowners in the west bank could become vulnerable to divestment from europe retail chains with outlets in settlements could be barred from the continent and manufacturers that use parts made in factories there could face labeling or sanctions advertisement continue reading the main story some have even suggested that settlement residents could lose the privilege that allows israeli citizens to travel to europe without a visa continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “the israeli pushback is about trying to intimidate europeans from not going further down this path” said daniel levy middle east director at the european council on foreign relations “the israelis want this process to move as slowly as possible because at a minimum it’s a headache and at a maximum ultimately it could be devastating”the european union’s decision to proceed on guidelines years in the making despite fierce lobbying by israel and intervention by a group of united states senators came after several of its member states and its own parliament formally or symbolically recognized an independent palestinian state those resolutions reflect mounting frustration in europe over the stalemated peace process and the growing political pressure on leaders in countries with large muslim populations sympathetic to the palestinian causea spokesman for the european commission speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject said wednesday’s move “in no way changes” the bloc’s stance on the peace process or israel’s special treatment in european markets where “made in israel” items carry little or no tariffs but “products coming from the settlements cannot benefit from those preferences” the spokesman saidisrael summoned the european union ambassador lars faaborgandersen to the foreign ministry and informed him that israel was suspending diplomatic talks scheduled for various forums in the coming weeks prime minister benjamin netanyahu and a host of other israeli leaders denounced the move as hypocritical because no such labels were proposed for products from occupied territories elsewhere in the world and they said it was particularly painful after weeks of palestinian attacks against israeli jews“the eu should be ashamed” mr netanyahu said in a statement “the eu has decided to label israel and we are not prepared to accept the fact that europe is labeling the side that is being attacked by terrorism”the labeling rules apply to fresh fruit and vegetables wine honey olive oil eggs poultry organic products and cosmetics coming from israeliowned businesses and farms outside the state’s original bordersrather than “product of israel” these goods must be labeled with the term “settlement” or “its equivalent” the rules say as in “product of west bank israeli settlement” goods from palestinianowned businesses can say “product of palestine” or “product of west bank palestinian product” advertisement continue reading the main story the producer exporter and importer are responsible for complying with the regulations but it is up to member countries to ensure that the rules are followed officials in brussels said the new standard is optional not mandatory for packaged foods and industrial products multimedia feature netanyahu and the settlements the israeli leader’s settlement policy resembles his predecessors’ but it is a march toward permanence at a time when prospects for peace are few open multimedia feature the guidelines from the european commission the bloc’s executive body come after foreign ministers from some member nations first in  and again this april urged brussels to take action some nations — britain in  denmark in  and belgium in  — had already issued their own labeling guidelinespalestinian leaders welcomed the initiative but said it did not go far enoughsettlementbased businesses “make products with stolen natural resources on the land of the palestinian people” saeb erekat secretary general of the palestine liberation organization said in a statement “those products should not only be labeled but should be banned” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a newsletter

leader of the boycott divestment and sanctions movement known as bds said labeling was “hardly a proportionate response to repeated israeli war crimes”the boycott movement which started a decade ago calls for cultural academic and economic boycotts of israel and has gained steam over the past year the movement has growing support on american college campuses and has claimed credit for the withdrawal by various international companies from projects in east jerusalem and the west bank israeli professors lately have reported cold treatment from universities abroad this past weekend the brazilian singer caetano veloso announced that he would no longer perform in israel because of what he saw this summer in the west bank after a concert he did in tel aviv in defiance of calls for a boycottthere are about  israeli companies operating in more than a dozen industrial zones in west bank settlements and roughly  acres of jewishrun farms the golan heights has many wineries whose wares have won international accoladesabout  palestinians work legally for israelis in the west bank earning as much as three times the wages paid by palestinian companies and mr netanyahu and other israelis said they would be the first to suffer from the step but mohammed alarqawi a palestinian union leader affiliated with the boycott movement said such consequences were worth achieving a broader goal“we believe that economic and political pressure is needed to challenge israel’s ability to deny us our basic rights” he said in a statement “people who are genuinely concerned about palestinian workers should take action to end israel’s deliberate destruction of the palestinian economy and its exploitation and oppression of our people”israeli politicians aligned with mr netanyahu and those very much opposed to him seemed to be competing in their condemnations on wednesday advertisement continue reading the main story yair lapid head of the centrist yesh atid party said the move “discriminates against israel and encourages terror”avigdor lieberman the ultranationalist former foreign minister wrote in a post on facebook “each time europe marks jews is a sign that antisemitism insanity and hypocrisy have taken over and will lead to disaster for the entire free world” michael b oren a lawmaker in mr netanyahu’s coalition and former israeli ambassador to washington included with his denunciation a naziera photo of a storefront painted with “jude” the german word for jew and a star of davidfor vered bensadon it was personal she is coowner of the tura winery in the west bank settlement of rechalim which exports  percent of its  bottles annually with labels that say “wine from the land of israel” she is also the granddaughter of a holocaust survivor“in the past jews were marked with a yellow patch and today they are looking to mark our products” ms bensadon  said on israel radio “europe rather than atoning for what it did  years ago is repeating the same ideas” but yariv oppenheimer director of the israeli group peace now said that anyone who likened labeling to a boycott — which he opposes — was “getting confused”“this decision can strengthen israel because it says there is a difference and what is produced in israel is legitimate — buy it invest and continue the ties” mr oppenheimer said in a radio interview “it is the right of every person and every country to say we don’t want to be part of this thing you are doing in the territories” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us

omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury

it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export

greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export

greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

from the occupied areas a joint open letter by  uk academics was published in the guardian  january  the letter called on the british government and the british people to take all feasible steps to

life mr mccartney must not come to israel he will not be safe there the sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export

for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice

australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

from the occupied areas a joint open letter by  uk academics was published in the guardian  january  the letter called on the british government and the british people to take all feasible steps to

life mr mccartney must not come to israel he will not be safe there the sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export

for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice minister yaakov neeman and finance minister yuval steinitz demanding a halt in the approval process of the law after the law was passed the farleft gush shalom movement petitioned the supreme court

australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

on the executive of the wcc to affirm the legitimacy of palestinian resistance to injustice and foreign occupation in february  following a sixmonth inquiry a select committee presented a report to the british parliament calling for the suspension of the european unions preferential trade agreement with israel until it israel lifts the movement restrictions which it has placed on palestinian trade between  and  the eu exported £ billion worth of goods to israel while the value of goods imported was £ billion archbishop desmond tutu has called on the international community to treat israel as it treated apartheid south africa and supports the divestment campaign against israel swedish archbishop k g hammar ambassador carl tham and a list of  others have supported a boycott of products from the occupied areas a joint open letter by  uk academics was published in the guardian  january  the letter called on the british government and the british people to take all feasible steps to oblige israel to stop its military aggression and colonial occupation of the palestinian land and its criminal use of force suggesting to start with a programme of boycott divestment and sanctions in  former beatles singer paul mccartney decided to perform in israel for the countrys th anniversary despite a death threat from militant islamic activist omar bakri muhammad who said if he values his life mr mccartney must not come to israel he will not be safe there the sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export

for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice minister yaakov neeman and finance minister yuval steinitz demanding a halt in the approval process of the law after the law was passed the farleft gush shalom movement petitioned the supreme court claiming that the law violated basic democratic principles the supreme court has given the israeli government  days to respondneeds update thirtyfour law professors signed a petition against the law to be forwarded to attorneygeneral yehuda weinstein during an address to the knesset israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected criticism over his failure to attend the boycott law vote and stressed that he had in fact approved the bill he also criticized kadima party members who initially supported the bill and later opposed its final version accusing them of folding to pressure australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

the british parliament calling for the suspension of the european unions preferential trade agreement with israel until it israel lifts the movement restrictions which it has placed on palestinian trade between  and  the eu exported £ billion worth of goods to israel while the value of goods imported was £ billion archbishop desmond tutu has called on the international community to treat israel as it treated apartheid south africa and supports the divestment campaign against israel swedish archbishop k g hammar ambassador carl tham and a list of  others have supported a boycott of products from the occupied areas a joint open letter by  uk academics was published in the guardian  january  the letter called on the british government and the british people to take all feasible steps to oblige israel to stop its military aggression and colonial occupation of the palestinian land and its criminal use of force suggesting to start with a programme of boycott divestment and sanctions in  former beatles singer paul mccartney decided to perform in israel for the countrys th anniversary despite a death threat from militant islamic activist omar bakri muhammad who said if he values his life mr mccartney must not come to israel he will not be safe there the sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export

for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice minister yaakov neeman and finance minister yuval steinitz demanding a halt in the approval process of the law after the law was passed the farleft gush shalom movement petitioned the supreme court claiming that the law violated basic democratic principles the supreme court has given the israeli government  days to respondneeds update thirtyfour law professors signed a petition against the law to be forwarded to attorneygeneral yehuda weinstein during an address to the knesset israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected criticism over his failure to attend the boycott law vote and stressed that he had in fact approved the bill he also criticized kadima party members who initially supported the bill and later opposed its final version accusing them of folding to pressure australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

entertainment gossip music sports business finance legal home israel canada bars west bank settlement wines from being labeled ‘product of israel’ israel canada bars west bank settlement wines from being labeled ‘product of israel’ by jta  july     share on facebook tweet on twitter jerusalem jta — canada has apparently barred wines imported from the west bank from being labeled as products of israel the liquor control board of the province of ontario on tuesday asked vendors to remove such wines from their shelves and to stop importing them the board cited a previously unreported july  ruling by the canadian food inspection agency that wine products made from grapes “grown fermented blended and finished in the west bank occupied territory” could not be labeled “product of israel” in a letter detailing the new labeling policy the board said the government food inspection agency had singled out psagot winery and shiloh winery located in the northern west bank the owners of those wineries expressed shock at the decision which they said would be a major blow to their businesses they said  to  percent of their wine was exported and canada was a major market still they said under no circumstances would they remove israel labeling from their bottles amichai lourie the ceo of shiloh winery located near the major israeli settlement and university town ariel said doing so would be equivalent to carving “traitor” into his forehead “there is no bribe there is no way it would happen that i would take off the wine we make in shiloh winery the words ‘made in israel’” he told jta thursday “it’s the most ungrateful thing that a person could do to make a product in israel and not stand behind it and be proud” yaakov berg the ceo of psagot winery situated on a hilltop overlooking the de facto palestinian capital ramallah said canada’s decision would do symbolic as well as financial harm to west bank settlement wineries like his “canada is important not only because of the market but also because of the image canada is north america it’s not some country in the far east” he told jta thursday “canada used to be our best ally if it happens there who knows what’s next” settlement wineries have boomed in the west bank in the past decade or so according to a  report settlements in the territory are home to  of the more than  wineries in israel and the other territories it captured in the  sixday war compared to  in the famed golan heights wine country several west bank settlement winery owners reported exponential increases in production since the early s much of the world does not recognize israel’s claims to the territories it considers israeli settlements in the territories illegal and in the case of the west bank an impediment to the creation of a palestinian state israel disputes this and has its own complex and evolving laws regarding what makes a settlement legal ontario’s liquor control board the province’s main retailer and distributor of alcohol said the labeling policy applied not just to the west bank but also to “any other territory occupied by israel in ” and named the golan heights eastern jerusalem and the gaza strip because the “government of canada does not recognize israel’s sovereignty over the territories” it said “wine products from these regions that are labeled as ‘product of israel’ would not be acceptable and would be considered misleading” yaakov berg posing at his psagot winery in psagot west bank june   andrew tobin “we are currently seeking clarifications from the cfia on how such wines should be labeled in order to comply with the food and drugs act” the board added canadian food inspection agency did not immediately respond to jta’s interview request in a statement wednesday the jewish advocacy group b’nai brith canada came out against what it called the canadian food inspection agency’s “disturbing decision” it said it expected the agency “will soon rescind its recent decision to order the removal of certain israeli wines from store shelves” meanwhile canaan khoury whose family owns the taybeh winery a palestinian enterprise located between psagot and shiloh welcomed canada’s decision saying it was hard to argue with the logic “it’s not a very surprising decision for a government to try to not be hypocritical” he told jta thursday “if a country recognizes that this location is not israel then why would it accept products being made here being labeled as if they were” taybeh winery is in talks with distributors in canada about exporting to the country but khoury said he did not know what the state’s labeling requirements would be he said his family refuses to label their wines as made in israel which has created bureaucratic hurdles to exporting to some countries canaan khoury posing in a promotional photo at his taybeh winery in the west bank courtesy of taybeh winery like the united states canada does not recognize a palestinian state arguing that it should be established through negotiations between israel and the palestinian authority this is not the first time west bank settler wineries have been involved in a labeling controversy in  the european union issued new guidelines that called on its  member states to label products made by israelis in the west bank as “made in settlements” in addition to wine such labels were to go on fruits and vegetables olive oil honey eggs poultry and cosmetics eu officials downplayed the move as a technical effort meant to ensure clarity about the products’ place of origin but israel reacted angrily and many saw it as an effort to pressure israel over its settlement movement only france has so far implemented the guidelines lourie said the bigger obstacle to selling wines in european countries is the boycott divestment and sanctions movement although west bank wines are recognized for their quality having won accolades at international competitions he said many distributors and vendors do not want the headache of dealing with potential protests he expressed optimism that the situation would be different in canada where he said most people support israel “the impression i get is that the problem in europe is not going to get better it’s going to get worse” he said “in canada i think the situation is different we have many friends there that’s why i didn’t see this coming” berg agreed but in the meantime he said psagot is preparing to sue canada for discrimination related articlesmore from author israel new security cameras at temple mount will respect public and its privacy israel

designed to underline us opposition to israel’s settlement policies washington has issued a reminder that products imported from the west bank or gaza strip should not be labeled “made in israel” the state department confirmed thursday the guidance was issued last week by us customs debate has since erupted after media reports suggested washington was hardening its stance against israeli settlement policy sources in the israeli foreign ministry said thursday night that they were studying the new us notice the move came soon after us ambassador to israel dan shapiro sharply criticized israel’s west bank settlement policy alleging that israel has two standards of law in the territory — one for israelis and another for palestinians shapiro’s remarks prompted a furious critique from israel’s prime minister benjamin netanyahu netanyahu has also frequently lambasted the european union for its policy of requiring labels on west bank settlement products while the us has backed the eu position state department spokesman mark toner said thursday that the us decision to reissue its labeling policy had been taken after complaints that some west bank products had been mislabeled prior to us import january   us notice on west bank country of origin marking requirements “us customs and border protection reissued guidance on their marking requirements” he told reporters “it in no way

requiring that goods from gaza and the west bank be labeled as such “it is not acceptable to mark the aforementioned goods with the words ‘israel’ ‘made in israel’ ‘occupied territoriesisrael’ or any variation thereof” the statement said some israeli settlers living in the west bank are known to label products for export as being from israel and the european union recently acted to ban the practice the us reminder unlike the eu guidelines does not mention the golan heights seized from syria in the  six day war and effectively annexed in  the state department reminder underscored ongoing us opposition to israel’s settlement policies us ambassador dan shapiro speaks at the th annual international conference of the institute for national security studies in tel aviv on january   matty sternus embassy tel aviv ambassador shapiro last week said the us administration was “concerned and perplexed” by israel’s settlement policy which he said raised “honest questions about israel’s longterm intentions” the comments drew a harsh response from netanyahu’s office which called them “unacceptable and incorrect” shapiro later apologized for the timing of his remarks — which came a day after a palestinian teenager killed a jewish mother of six in the west bank settlement of otniel and on the day that a pregnant woman was stabbed in another palestinian attack in the tekoa settlement but he stood by the content of his comments netanyahu has also repeatedly condemned the european labeling move which israel feels discriminates against jewish producers and amounts to a boycott for its part by contrast the state department last week came out in support of the european union labeling guidelines and said that settlement product labeling is not tantamount to a boycott earlier this month the prime minister called for a “reset” in relations with the eu accusing it of unfairly singling out israel “we have to reset our relationship with the eu i hope we can do this on better terms” the prime minister told foreign journalists in jerusalem “there is a natural tendency in the eu establishment to single out israel and treat it in ways that other countries are not being dealt with and especially other democracies” he said “and i think it’s wrong i think it should be corrected” the united states opposes israel’s settlements but insists its labeling regulations don’t discriminate between israeli and palestinian producers “our understanding is that there were allegations of mislabeling around nine or ten complaints” toner said explaining why us customs had reissued its guidance “as you know us guidelines don’t differentiate between products produced in settlements or anywhere else in the west bank” he said like us on facebook get our newsletter follow us on twitter startup

netanyahu presented a select group of international business people with the highest tribute ever awarded by the “state of israel” the jubilee award marking israel’s fiftieth year of independence recognizes those individuals and organizations that through their investments and trade relationships have done the most to strengthen the israeli economy frequently asked question why so many companies our strategy is to have a focused campaign where individual israeli companies are targeted wherever possible rather than wide boycotts of whole stores this means that whilst there are more brands on the list they are actually easier to boycott so for example whilst bq and homebase are major sellers of israeli plastic giant keter’s products we are calling for a focused boycott of each keter related brand – outstanding lipski jardin allibert curver and contico rather than a blanket boycott of these stores why are some of the brands in the previous boycott israel campaign missing from this campaign over time many companies have reconsidered their support for israel and some have divested from israel due to many reasons including the accumulated pressure of the boycott these changes are reflected in the new card disney disney working with the israeli embassy was given  million dollars by israel to promote jerusalem as the capital of israel at a special exhibition at its epcot centre in florida strategically positioned so that every visitor to the centre would have to walk through the exhibition in order to reach the exit jerusalem is an illegally occupied palestinian city and under international law can never be the capital of israel the exhibition has since been removed so disney is no longer on the boycott list sara lee sara lee has divested its large stake in the israeli textile giant delta galil so it along with its two dozen plus brands have all been removed from the boycott list nokia nokia ventures organization which had so heavily invested in israel is no longer part of nokia and is now called bluerun ventures and has many investors now note that nokia is still one of its investors but its stake in israel is now no more prominent than countless other technology companies who are not on the boycott list so nokia has also been removed from the list arsenal fc following a concerted campaign arsenal football club’s contract with the israeli tourism board to promote israel as the teams “official and exclusive travel destination” on its digital perimeter boards to an estimated  million viewers in  countries was not renewed subsequently arsenal fc has been removed from the boycott list note that arsenal still runs ‘arsenal in the galilee’ coaching project in israel selfridges selfridges flagship store in london was picketed for stocking a range of settlement products including ahava and soon a boycott of the store followed it no longer sells ahava dead sea products on its website although it does advertise estee lauder origins ‘body scrubs’ which include dead sea salts as part of our strategy of a more focused boycott campaign where individual israeli brands like ahava are targeted selfridges in no longer on the boycott list danone whilst danone is still on the boycott list it has gone through some changes and lost some of its famous brands and these are no longer on the boycott list jacob biscuits is now owned by united biscuits hp foods and lea  perrins is now owned by hj heinz and similarly galbani and lu biscuits are also no longer owned by danone   what is the boycott israel card and how can i get

every right to exist even with the ever growing evidence and facts of treatment of palestinians you need to watch the following videos available in the public domain to hear the truth only if you can handle it listen to their own people shout out against israel the following video is amazing especially how the rabi tells how jews and muslims coexisted prior to the birth of israel it brought tears

retailers sell israeli goods and most of them sell produce from illegal israeli settlements in the west bank some have made statements in support of zionism and some have contracts with israeli companies there is a growing movement to boycott israeli goods in solidarity with the people of palestine and in line with an international call for boycott divestment and sanctions there have been reports in the press that israeli producers are experiencing a decline in demand for israeli produce since the bombardment of gaza in january  this could be the beginning of a snowball effect for the

expose in  accusing supermarkets of misleading british consumers tesco admitted it had acted “in error” and stated that israeli dates “originating solely in the west bank will in the future be labelled as such” bigcampaign and others groups have been campaigning against the ‘west bank’ label as it misleads consumers into believing produce from illegal settlements is actually palestinian the palestinian general delegation to the uk has written a letter of protest to tesco and other retailers for persisting in the use of this misleading label tesco says that ‘freedom of choice’ is one of the company’s priorities and consumers can choose not to buy israeli products however in correspondence with campaigners in  tesco representatives said they were phasing out tesco’s line of israeli peppers due to consumer pressure boycott israeli goods campaigners have also consistently attended the tesco agm to raise the issue of settlement produce and propose a boycott of israeli goods john

sections of the arab population of palestine should be transplanted to iraq and other middleeastern arab states” jewish chronicle  in  sieff in a book entitled on management the marks and spencer way wrote that one of the fundamental objectives of ms was to “aid the economic development of israel” there have been no reports of ms openly showing ideological support for israel since  the retail company has repeatedly asserted that “it has no ‘special’ relationship with any government political party or religious group” but accepts that ms does “make representations to governments in support of its commercial aims” ms management has not to our knowledge commented on lord sieff’s remarks in support of zionism and has not made a statement as to whether the current management stands by them in  sir richard greenbury then ceo of marks  spencer received the jubilee award from israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu in  the jerusalem report stated that “ms supports israel with  million in trade each year” in october  the jewish chronicle reported that the britishisrael chamber of commerce bicc had held meetings at marks  spencer’s offices in baker street however in  the store claimed that ms “do not host meetings on our premises for the bicc” nevertheless in december  stuart rose ceo of marks and spencer at the time was a listed speaker at the annual dinner of the bicc when questioned in correspondence about the sale of israeli goods in ms stores in  an ms spokesperson said that the company buys “from israel as… from  other countries…” and went on to state that the company would continue to do so the letter continued to say that “we always put the country of origin on the products we sell where we buy israeli products we label them as products of israel” ms

company partowned by the israeli state ms also stocks large quantities of delta galil clothing largely underwear delta galil is israel’s largest manufacturer and marketer of textiles it is also a major beneficiary of the establishment of ‘qualifying industrial zones’ qiz in egypt and jordan which promote an unequal normalisation of trade arrangements between israel the palestinian authority and egypt and jordan marks and spencer also sells textiles produced by israeli firms solog and polgat until very recently ms openly sold products from illegal israeli settlements the guardian reported in  that the company stocked an extensive range of settlement products since  however ms has made repeated statements to the press claiming that they do not stock goods from the occupied territories see here for example in  the store wrote “we do not buy products from the west bank golan heights or gaza as we cannot safely visit the suppliers in these areas because of the current security situation” it seems probable that the move to cease selling settlement products was in fact due to effective campaigning protests and fear of adverse press coverage but despite the above assurance there is evidence that ms continues to stock hadiklaim dates packaged as an ms own brand product according to a recent report by school of oriental and african studies soas hadiklaim the israel date growers’ cooperative ltd “exports dates from israel and from the occupied territories especially israeli settlements in the jordan valley” in correspondence with soas in  david gregory technical food director for ms stated the following “in the past we have sold dates from this region however we made a policy decision sometime ago to cease all purchases from this area however our uk suppliers do buy raw material dates from the organisation hadiklaim on our behalf the contract explicitly prohibits purchase from palestinian territories and hadiklaim source the dates from elsewhere within israel to satisfy our requirements traceability systems are in place to confirm the source of the dates” ms has faced sustained protests due to their historic ideological support for the israeli state and because of their policy of stocking israeli goods pickets have been held and store signs and billboards subvertised in manchester three pickets were held in january  in response to the bombing of gaza

to the occupation of palestine on the sourcing of products from overseas we are always guided by the position of the uk government and by the european union on trade policy” there is evidence that asda does stock goods from illegal israeli settlements in its uk stores asda stocks potatoes from mehadrintnuport export company mtex mtex is now the secondlargest israeli exporter of fresh produce to

found to carry israeli products including carmel mangoes sweet potatoes peppers sweet peppers grown by sulat cherry tomatoes herbs passion fruit jaffa oranges and own brand tinned grapefruit the coop has faced pickets and repeated representations from consumers and campaigners over its sale of produce from illegal settlements and israeli produce in the last year criticism has centred around the sale of settlement produce for example campaigners attended the cooperative group south east region general meeting in january  and raised concerns about the ethics of selling settlement produce the coop board undertook to look into conditions on settlement farms throughout the year the issue was raised with coop management by members of the coop and its customers on the th january  len wardle cooperative group chair wrote “the cooperative group board has decided to suspend sourcing products from illegal west bank settlements however we will continue to trade with israel and will seek to develop trading links with palestinian farmers the cooperative group only rarely curtails trade with particular countries or regions however in the case of the illegal settlement in the israeli controlled occupied territories it has proven to be all but impossible to ensure that supplies derived from the region are not perpetuating injustice and unfair terms of trade we will no longer source dates grapes and a number of herbs from the illegal west bank settlements and will be phasing out the use of similar items from our own brand products” in making this statement the coop is the first store to base its reasons for ceasing the sale of settlement goods on ethical concerns the statement is weaker in some ways than that of ms but only in that it precludes the sale of west bank goods and not produce from the golan heights it is also unclear whether the coop’s definition of the west bank includes east jerusalem moreover the cooperative group does not make any assurance that it will not sell products in its stores supplied by companies which source products from both the settlements and  israel such as hadiklaim mtex and carmel agrexco in november  ynet claimed that the coop had met with the coop israel a separate organisation and agreed to open a chain of kosher supermarkets which will be equally owned by coop israel and the uk coop the uk coop has refuted this claim but

may be about israeli products we do not think it is right to ask our buyers to base their choice of products on any other criteria than the commercial ones of quality and value for money” waitrose

range of products sourced from carmel agrexco including a wide variety of organic herbs and vegetables grown on israeli settlements mainly in the jordan valley and certified as organic by the soil

“joint israeli and palestinian” enterprises in february  a spokesperson wrote “we currently take organic cut herbs from two farms in the west bank on which a mixed palestinianisraeli workforce have worked side by side for many years” waitrose has responded to some concerns about the conditions of labourers on settlement farms however the response has been to assure customers that each ‘supplier’ audits the relevant settlement farms using a “tight criteria” that relates to “worker hours salaries and employment contracts” this effectively means that waitrose entrusts the auditing of settlement farms to the settlement company supplying the produce presumably carmel agrexco waitrose claims that its technical directors have inspected its supplier farms in the west bank overall waitrose has been one of the most intransigent british supermarkets when faced with concern over sale of israeli produce and israeli settler produce the chain has been the subject of protests and pickets across
