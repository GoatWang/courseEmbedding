valuesummarynetsol’s growth was interrupted in late  by the introduction of a new much more advanced productcustomers stopped buying its old product and took a year or so to evaluate the new one resulting in lower sales and lossesthe new product nfs ascent has now gained traction sales are booming and the company is profitable againbackground netsol technologies inc nasdaqntwk is a vehicle and equipment leasing software company it sells its flagship leasing software nfs ascent around the world to auto dealers banks and equipment manufacturers customers include nissan ford mercedes toyota volkswagen volvo chase citigroup terex and cisco in the most recent quarter ended december    of sales were in asia the pacific and the middle east the company is nominally headquartered in california but about  of its employees are in lahore pakistan its ceo najeeb ghauri is pakistani and his brother naeem and nephew asad both have executive level positions with the company the ghauris owned a collective  of the stock of the company as of june   najeeb and naeem have been with the company since the s to my knowledge ntwk is the only pakistani based company listed in the us in the fiscal year ended june   the five largest countries for revenue in order were china united kingdom the us indonesia and thailand ntwk has a subsidiary netsol technologies ltd netsol pk which is traded on the karachi exchange in pakistan ntwk owned  of this entity on june   up from  one year earlier sales from china and central asia are run through this company financial history on october   ntwk announced the introduction and release of nfs ascent its newest software family this led to an immediate drop of revenues as customers avoided the legacy software and took a year or two to evaluate the new software that can be shown in the sales and earnings below in s fye  fye  fye  fye   mo   mo  revenues       op exp        depr amort       net income       operating expenses includes cost of goods and excludes depreciation and amortization as shown above revenues were increasing rapidly in fye  they had also increased from  million in fye  they were knocked down considerably in fiscal  by the introduction of nfs ascent while potential customers evaluated the product management stepped on the gas and went on a hiring spree to provide infrastructure to meet expected demand for the new product hundreds of it professionals were hired along with new salespeople the staff increased from  on june   to  on march   this led to a large loss in fye  as revenues from the new product did not immediately materialize but expenses took off revenues bounced back in fye  as contracts started rolling in however the company still had a loss that year as it continued to add staff sales have continued to increase and in the second quarter of fiscal  and earnings returned management now believes it has the infrastructure in place to handle a much larger level of sales and has mostly stopped adding staff proof of this is that second quarter  sales increased by  million from the first quarter while operating expenses only increased  large new contract on december   the company announced by far the largest contract in its history totaling  million the contract is with one company and covers australia china hong kong india japan new zealand singapore south korea taiwan thailand and malaysia the contract also includes implementation of nfs ascent in south africa a new market for ntwk the implementation phase spans a fiveyear period with maintenance and support over ten years this contract is to an existing customer however most of the revenue is new management expects new revenue from the contract to average  to  million dollars a year the revenue starts in the current quarter and ramps up all year the next fiscal year will likely be a peak period the majority of the revenue is from services such as customization and change orders the  million figure is a minimum it is expected to be larger it is important to note that management is has significantly slowed hiring believing that it has the staff in place to handle this contract i believe the hiring done last year was in part in expectation of signing this contract what this means is that most of the revenues will fall to the bottom line with one exception impact of netsol pk to discuss that exception we have to go back to its subsidiary netsol pk in the most recent quarter ended december   net income was  however about half of that or  went to the minority shareholders of netsol pk and two smaller majority owned subsidiaries since those shareholders only own  of netsol pk this indicates netsol pk earned more than  of the profits for ntwk as a whole that quarter this is somewhat of an unusual item as shown below to minority  to minority period net income shareholders shareholders qe     fye     fye     fye     fye     as shown above the amount of profits going to minority shareholders was high in the most recent quarter but not unprecedented the netsol pk subsidiary appears to generally have a higher profit margin than the rest of the company this will likely change from quarter to quarter and in general the amount of ntwks take should be higher most quarters the new contract includes many markets outside of netsol pk as noted earlier the company is reducing the impact of minority shareholders by steadily buying shares of netsol pk on the open market earnings analysis ntwk earned  eps in the quarter ended december   management stated that adjusted net income was  eps however that number is misleading it added back income taxes and depreciation two items i have not seen before and disagree with those two added about  to adjusted eps it also added back stock compensation of  that is much more common though i still dont like it adjusted eps if you include just net income and amortization was about  and with stock compensation was  stock compensation is moderate with about  of outstanding stock being issued as stock options each year there is only one analyst following this company ntwk has beaten his estimate by  or  each of the last three quarters management on its most recent earnings call stated that minimum revenues in this fiscal year will be  million this indicates revenues from the last two quarters will average at least  million balance sheet leverage is low total interest bearing debt was  million on december   this was only  of tangible equity which was  million on that date tangible equity had a book value of  per share cash on hand totaled  million and had a book value of  per share risks china is currently the largest market with  of revenues in fye  china in my opinion is in for a hard landing while much of the income from china is on long term contracts a hard landing will likely slow or stop new contracts in the country and reduce services income from existing customers it could be a few years before the hard landing begins prior to  ntwk capitalized its research and development significantly overstating earnings this practice was stopped shortly after roger almond was retained as cfo in september  also there were significant internal accounting deficiencies found by the auditors every quarter for many years these were primarily due to inadequate accounting expertise these deficiencies were no longer noted beginning in mid ntwk is effectively domiciled in pakistan a country with political instability and a relatively high level of terror activity being pakistani is also a strength as the company has been able to hire a talented it workforce for much less than it would have to pay elsewhere there is less competition for it talent than in india revenues are from three sources license fees maintenance fees and services maintenance fees are recurring and license fees are not the bulk of revenues are currently service fees which are in between while services done are mostly not recurring the more customers the more services are likely to be performed if new contracts slow services revenue may decline and license revenue will decline even more conclusion ntwk has had a checkered past including aggressive and inadequate accounting and large losses the accounting issues appear to have gone away within a year of hiring the current cfo in  based on a surge in revenues tied to a new much improved product the company is now profitable their primary market is asia which has a much lower leasing penetration than in the us leading to more opportunities a key takeaway here is that management has already made the investments needed to support its recent large contract and other near term new business this means that most new revenues will fall to the operating income line from there some will be diverted to minority shareholders my estimate is that about  of revenue growth over the next  months will fall right to the bottom line management is optimistic about its new business pipeline based on this and the rapid pace of new contracts recently more growth is likely in fiscal  starting july   the big contract will probably add  million a quarter meaning  to  million of additional profits just from that contract this a huge catalyst going forward any other new large contracts are gravy on top ntwk has been adding salespeople in north america and europe over the past year to date they have not increased revenues there but it takes a while to get traction as we saw with the nfs ascent product elsewhere it should also be noted that most of the  million contract revenue is new despite being to an existing customer this indicates that significant new revenues can be generated from existing customers ntwk can get considerable growth just by working its existing customer base due to its advanced new product the company earned  per share last quarter before minority interests i expect the big contract to add  million a quarter in earnings in fiscal  ending  this increases earnings to  to  a quarter the company is also amortizing intangibles that were from when they used to capitalize rd this amortization is  per quarter bringing adjusted earnings to  to  per quarter conservatively assuming  of the earnings are in the majority owned subsidiaries the minority interests get about  of net income leaving  to  of net income to ntwk shareholders adjusted net income adding back amortization is  to  these numbers assume new contracts are only sufficient to maintain revenues where they are the company has had significant growth the past six quarters a strong pipeline and a large customer base they can mine for upgrades to nfs ascent which generates much more revenue it is likely they will beat these estimates assuming midpoint earnings of  per share per quarter in fiscal  that brings annual income to  with a  pe the stock will be worth  since i think they will continue to add contracts my oneyear price target is  that would be a double from the closing price of  on friday disclosure i amwe are long ntwk i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving
