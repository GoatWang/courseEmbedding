years beverly l hall the former school superintendent here ruled by fear principals were told that if state test scores did not go up enough they would be fired — and  percent of them were removed in the decade of dr hall’s reignunderlings were humiliated during rallies at the georgia dome dr hall permitted principals with the highest test scores to sit up front near her while sticking those with the lowest scores off to the side in the bleachersshe was chauffeured around the city often with an entourage of aides and security guards when she spoke publicly questions had to be submitted beforehand for screening “she was known as the queen in her ivory tower” said verdaillia turner president of the atlanta teachers’ unionbut dr hall got results test scores soared two national groups named her superintendent of the year the secretary of education arne duncan hosted her at the white house advertisement continue reading the main story fear seemed to workthen last summer the atlanta miracle collapsed a state investigation found that  principals and teachers at nearly half the district’s schools — desperate to raise test scores — had cheated students from this poor mostly africanamerican school district who could barely read were rated proficient on state tests and they didn’t receive the remedial help they needed continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story for months the fulton county district attorney has been investigating former school officials felony indictments are expected for altering state documents lying to investigators and theft of government fundsby last spring gov nathan deal and mayor kasim reed of atlanta knew they had to find someone to clean up the mess they asked erroll b davis jr to become the new superintendent when dr hall left at the end of junemr davis who is  did not need the job his wife of  years hoped he would not take it he had nothing to prove an engineer by training he had been the chief executive of a wisconsinbased utility company and then starting in  the chancellor of the university system of georgia in october  he announced he would retire from the chancellorship the following summerpeople tried to warn him off the atlanta job michael bowers a former attorney general who was codirector of the state investigation understood how pervasive the corruption was and how daunting it would be to change the culture “i know erroll i told him ‘you’re crazy as a bedbug to take that job at your age’ ” mr bowers recalled “you know why he did it he is a genuine public servant”for his part mr davis said “when i look back at my life i don’t want my contribution to have been shaving a few eighths off a bond deal to make a million dollars”on july  the day he was supposed to retire mr davis was sitting at dr hall’s old desk reading the page investigative report and trying to figure out which if any of the people in the offices surrounding him could be trustedsince then he has been unbending about rooting out corruption to the point that richard l hyde who had been the lead investigator on the commission that issued the state report said “he’s brought order to chaos it’s very impressive” mr davis has removed more than the  teachers and principals named in the report and he dismissed several top administrators advertisement continue reading the main story he has also made himself accessible visiting  to  schools each month unannounced and he has been kind during a stop at slater elementary last week he walked into every classroom “i want to thank you for what you do” he told each teacher “i couldn’t do your job”as he travels the district often driving himself to meet with small groups of principals mr davis repeatedly tells them “education is the only industry in this country where failure is blamed on the workers not the leadership”politically he was the right choice for the job on one level the state investigation had been viewed as racially tinged pitting former gov sonny perdue a white republican who ordered the inquiry in  while still in office against dr hall a black woman who served a democratic constituencybeyond his talents mr davis offered something to both sideshe had been chosen for the university chancellorship by mr perdue and he is africanamerican a must for a school district where most of the work force and students are blackmr davis says he is not political describing himself as “slightly left of center on social issues and slightly right of center on fiscal matters”his salary as superintendent is  less than half of what he made as the university system chancellorhe is an engineer to the core bringing office work to football games to read during breaks “a football game takes three and a half hours” he said “but if you add up the actual playing time it’s much less so there’s a lot i can get done” he hangs his suits on two racks taking the first in line wearing it for a day putting it at the end and repeatingdr hall and her top aides had six secretaries and receptionists mr davis and his have threepeople are still shellshocked from the hall years ms turner the union president said she was surprised when mr davis’s secretary called to set up a lunch “i said ‘why does he want to do that’ ” ms turner recalled “she said ‘he wants to get to know you’ the man is a breath of fresh air” advertisement continue reading the main story dr hall was viewed as inaccessible sequestered in her officemr davis’s home telephone number is listedrecently he received a complaint that a teacher had given her students the answers to a test after investigating he immediately removed her from the classroom “my policy is zero tolerance” he said “i do not want people who cheat teaching children can i do that we’ll find out if i lose so be it sue me”during his visit to slater elementary he stopped to inspect the bathrooms “everything good” asked the assistant principal jeffrey copeland“actually no” mr davis said “a toilet overflowed”later as he was leaving mr davis checked to see if it had been fixed“done” said a custodian explaining that someone had clogged it with a whistle“thank you for what you do” mr davis saida product of the pittsburgh public schools mr davis finished high school at age  by  he had an engineering degree from carnegie mellon university by  a master’s degree in business from the university of chicago he says he does not want a school system driven by test results“that is not how education should work” mr davis said “if you create the right kind of system run by the right kind of people tests scores will take care of themselves”when dr hall was the superintendent she covered one wall in her office with bar graphs showing the test
