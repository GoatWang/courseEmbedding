jul    javascript   comments socketio is our favorite engine for building fast realtime applications here’s why we love it easy to use node module on the server side and javascript library for the client works well with express and follows similar middleware patterns on use uses web sockets but degrades gracefully to other methods when not available polling builtin support for name spacing rooms and authentication let’s look at a basic example of how to build a simple express web server with socketio handling the realtime communication first open a new file in your favorite text editor called “serverjs” and add the following lines of code var app  requireexpress var http  requirehttpserverapp var io  requiresocketiohttp here we’ve done three things create an instance of the express web server create an http listener and attach express create a socketio server and attach it to the http listener express will handle most of the http requests but any requests to “socketio” will be passed through to the socketio engine next we need to serve out some html to the client appget functionreq res script body html as you can see its a basic chat window with a text input and send button at the bottom we’ve also set up two basic javascript events send the message in the text input when the send button is pressed append the message to the div when a “chat message” is received from the server to run the example install the required modules and execute with node npm install socketio npm install express node serverjs and point your browser at httplocalhost full source for this example
