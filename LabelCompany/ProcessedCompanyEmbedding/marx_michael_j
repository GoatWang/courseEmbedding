specializes in unique and original works  he has been working with pmc since  and believes that “sanity is the playground of the unimaginative”   his work is currently being shown at multiple northern california art galleries born in massachusetts in  he lived there for  years before becoming a bornagain californian in   he currently resides in alameda california where he has lived since   he primarily works in pmc with occasional forays into mixedmedia and polymer clay   artist statement i create jewelry that is wearable sculpture i believe that jewelry is not just for the embellishment and adornment of the body with precious metals jewelry should not be any less of a medium for provocation than any other art form and so it is not exempt from having to provoke a response     i have been a sculptor and artist as long as i can remember my childhood gifts were art supplies as often as they were toys or books  in the beginning i sculpted in fimo a polymer clay and this honed my ability to transform my visions into d images  in  i took my first pmc precious metal clay class and was hooked  pmc’s affinity for texture flexibility of form and choices of finishing techniques make it ideal for me as an artist    each piece i create is meant to inspire a full spectrum of emotional reactions in both the individual wearing the sculpture and the public viewing it whether a smile frown joy anger or disgust this is not to say that i have not made “pretty” things but i do like poking the proverbial hornet’s nest from time to time  my work also has what i call “the giggle factor”  as i envision a piece and begin working on it i know i’m on the right track when i start laughing to myself    symbols have always played an important role in my creativity author margot asquith once said “symbols are the imaginative signposts of life”  symbols are part of our everyday life religious icons traffic signs and ad logos while there are common definitions associated with certain symbols i appreciate the fact that people attach their own meaning and importance to symbols and that the response to a symbol can be different with each viewer based on their own life experiences     symbols in my work range from the obvious to the obscure and often reference experiences and emotions that have made lasting impressions in my life travel the “voices in my head” things that make me laugh or smile memories of fine and pop art  religious iconography tattoo flash christiancatholic churches jewish synagogues mayan deities and shaman images and egyptian art as influential as these all are ancient symbols have had the greatest impact on my art 　    whether reinterpreting existing symbols creating new symbols or tearing apart and recombining them to change their impact and meaning symbols are the majority of what my art is about  for example the heart as a symbol of love gets broken and combined with a middle finger to create the “cosmic f you” which represents the hostility anger and pain of a breakup  or the combination of a halfgorilla and halfdevil which represents my selfportrait      i adopted the symbol of the spiral very early in my work for a variety of reasons and it accompanies each piece i make as it goes out into the world the spiral is universal existing in nature from microscopic crystal formations to the shape of entire galaxies it is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent and is a part of every culture it represents the “lifedeathrebirth” cycle it represents the sun and although each loop of the spiral brings one back to the same place it represents moving on to a higher and more evolved level at each turn  just as my work continues to evolve and become more refined over timeby working in pmc i feel as if i am being true to myself and true to my art to spend the time making the images and symbols that i do is to listen to the voices in the creative void  it allows my passion for art and beauty to have a voice and to leave my mark on the world   websites httpwwwunsaneartcom httpwwwflickrcomunsaneart   copyright   metal clay guru all rights reserved brought to you by metal clay supply
