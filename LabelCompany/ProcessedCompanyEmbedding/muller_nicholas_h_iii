endorsementsnow come two venerable historians with yet another portrait — not just of the man in all his complexity but of his evolving grandiose reputation and how it served the purposes of the writers their society and the state that became invested in a conflation of history and legendinventing ethan allen by john j duffy and nicholas muller iii published by the university of new england takes a hard look at what is known about ethan allen from the documentary record and what was written speculatively about him ultimately they argue it was a thcentury confection that elevated him to heroic biggerthanlife status and that helped make him the namesake of everything from a furniture company to a think tank —burlington free press“with solid research duffy and muller convince readers that many facts were lost in the fictional depiction of allen   this study contributes immensely to our understanding of the cult of the vermont hero and heroes in general” —journal of american history“what ethan allen wasn’t everything we’ve come to believe duffy and muller make the eyeopening case that the hero of ticonderoga the defender of the new hampshire grants and the patriot whose name and image adorn ships statues highways and stores is as much legend as fact great jehovah”—james h douglas former governor of vermontthis is a good book overall and should appeal to anyone interested in america’s struggle for independence or vermont history —hnet“inventing ethan allen describes in detail the shifting historical images of vermont’s most famous revolutionary hero the story duffy and muller tell is both complex and entertaining involving allen’s own selfpromotion several biographers the founders of the vermont historical society state politicians professional as well as amateur historians sculptors and entrepreneurs fond of exploiting ethan’s fame the book also gives straightforward summaries of what we know and don’t know about allen’s life a mustread for anyone interested in how vermonters relate to their past”—jere daniell professor of history emeritus dartmouth college“inventing ethan allen is a remarkable achievement an incisive scholarly and often amusing account of both the ‘real’ and the ‘invented’ ethan allen muller and duffy relying on research of extraordinary depth and breadth have written a probing and witty inquiry into the neverending struggle between the unsettling facts of the past and the enduring power of myth”—dona brown professor of history university of vermont“duffy and muller help readers better understand vermont’s most famous citizen and how contemporary society impacts historians their writing and the need for critical historical inquiry—journal of the american revolution“inventing ethan allen is a watershed book of tremendous importance two of vermont’s most respected scholars have joined forces to bring ethan allen down to size i believe vermonters have always suspected that the ‘real’ ethan allen put his pants on one leg at a time but we needed to be told—and to be told in a way that can be believed vermont is indebted to duffy and muller still the ‘real’ ethan allen stands in my mind as one hell of a man were i to confront him on the question of his courage i would be sure to have a grin on my face”—frank bryan professor emeritus university of vermont awardsrecognition journal of the american
