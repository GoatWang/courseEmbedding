susceptible to different interpretations or meanings id iv standard of record review jpmorgan argues that the court must apply a deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review to its decision to recoup pierces stock gains where a contract vests a corporate administrative committee with the authority to make binding final and conclusive decisions regarding an employees eligibility under a corporate compensation plan a court should accept the committees decision as conclusive in the absence of fraud bad faith and the like schwartz v century circuit inc  ad   del ch relying in part on schwartz one delaware superior court has held when a stock option committee is vested with final binding and conclusive authority to determine a participants right to receive or retain benefits that

had breached a noncompete clause in a stock option plan and was thus liable under the terms of the plan for profits he had gained through the exercise of certain stock options id at  the stock option agreement in hall granted the committee absolute discretion to make final binding and conclusive determinations while the plan itself provided that all decisions were final and binding id at  the committees clawback decision was upheld in the absence of evidence that the committee relied upon false or incorrect evidence or acted in bad faith id at  pierce maintains that jpmorgans decision is subject to de novo review in reviewing a corporate boards decision to cancel certain executive stock options following a corporate merger one federal district court applying delaware law drew an analogy to the review of decisions under erisa with respect to top hat plans where the plan authorized the administrator to interpret the plan hilton hotels corporation v dunnet  fsuppd   wdtenn recognizing that the plans at issue authorized a board committee to interpret the plans and agreements the district court held that the boards decision was subject to judicial review for an exercise of good faith and reasonable discretion subject to the idea that the court must review the boards decision more closely where there is evidence of a conflict of interest or bias hilton hotels  fsuppd at   the court found abundant evidence that the board had arbitrarily interpreted the plan as authorizing a cancellation of executive stock options prior to a merger with hilton hotels including an eleventh hour change of interpretation after the issue became a dealbreaker for the acquiring hilton hotels corporation hilton hotels  fsuppd at  the district court conducted its own interpretation of the plan language and denied summary judgment on concluding that the plan language did not unambiguously support the corporations position that the plan authorized the cancellation of the executive stock options id at   common among the cited authority is the legal principal that if a stock option compensation plan authorizes the corporate decisionmaker to interpret the plan and issue final and binding plan decisions a court will uphold a decision if it is consistent with the plan language and not otherwise the product of fraud bad faith or an abuse of reasonable discretion schwartz  ad at  hall  wl  at  hilton hotels  fsuppd at   the hilton hotels court more closely reviewed a corporate boards interpretation of a stock option plan for an abuse of discretion after independent evidence was proffered of a conflict of interest — that the board had suddenly changed its interpretation of the plan without further legal research simply to facilitate a corporate merger id at  this approach is analogous to the review of erisa decisions if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest that conflict must be weighed as a factor  in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion miller v metropolitan life ins co  fd  th cir quoting firestone tire and rubber co v bruck  us    sct   ledd   paragraph b of the  plan

binding determinations in one or more of the stock award agreements divests the committee of such authority is not well taken considering that the  plan and  plan express control over the stock award agreements id pierce also argues that notwithstanding the grant of discretionary authority to the committee the court must apply a de novo standard of review because decisionmaker human resources hr director farrell was never delegated decisionmaking authority by the committee or jpmorgans chief executive officer ceo pierce relies on crider v highmark life ins co  fsuppd  wdmich and mauldin v worldcom inc  fd  th cir  to support her position the district court in crider applied a de novo standard of review in an erisa action after determining that a disability benefits plan did not contain provisions authorizing the plan issuer to delegate its decisionmaking authority to a thirdparty claims administrator thus failing to meet erisas requirement of an express delegation of authority crider  fsuppd at  citing  usc § c in contrast the  plan and  plan each expressly provide at paragraph c the committee may designate persons other than its members to carry out its responsibilities under such conditions or limitations as it may set other than its authority with regard to awards granted to employees who are officers or directors of the corporation for purposes of section  of the exchange act crider is thus distinguishable beyond the additional circumstance that the  plan and  plan are not erisa plans subject to the requirements of  usc § c in opposing jpmorgans motion pierce

and not the result of a winnowing or sifting process it means action taken without consideration of and in disregard of the facts and circumstances of the case action is also said to be arbitrary and

unpublished citing willdel realty inc v new castle county  ad   delch v record review jpmorgan contends hr director farrell properly concluded that pierce breached the noncompete clauses by becoming employed by jpmorgan competitor charter one and performing the same or substantially similar functions she had performed as jpmorgans senior vice president pierce responds that she performed only retail banking functions for jpmorgan and performs only commercial banking functions at charter one for customers with revenues of greater than  million pierce maintains that farrells decision that she performed the same or substantially similar functions at charter one is biased and not the product of a deliberate principled reasoning process saundra schrock pierces direct supervisor at jpmorgan testified regarding her conversation when pierce tendered her resignation q what was it that miss pierce told you that made you go to hr and start this process a by schrock first of all when she notified me that she was resigning that she was accepting the position of president of charter one in michigan and the conversation the best of my knowledge went along something like this saundra ive decided to accept the position it will allow me to be president of all the functions and all the responsibility for overall in michigan which is a broader based job than i have today something along those lines and that it will allow me not to have to travel which a small portion of sandys job was to travel and be home with my family that would trigger she is going to a major competitor and that it would in my mind be a position that my first thought would be might trigger something in our stock performance agreement and i called hr not only to tell her that a very senior person had resigned i called my boss as well and frankly the very first thought was not of the stock agreement but the fact that she was leaving that was a very — it was you know not obviously something we had anticipated to happen q you said that she told you she was going to be president of charter one in michigan over all functions a right q what was your understanding of what she meant by all functions a we didnt have a detailed conversation but to the best of my ability of understanding exactly what she said on the initial conversation was she was going to be president of the overall bank which frankly we did not discuss in detail but it was — the assumption would be that it would be all aspects of the bank schrock march   tr at  pierce does not dispute the substance of this conversation with schrock testifying q so now here we are at november   what was your personal understanding at that point as to whether or not the position you were about to assume at charter triggered those clawback obligations pierces counsel trigger of course was action by jpmorgan they would trigger it because — they would need to make a decision but i gather what youre saying is whatever thinking she might have had about exposure if they triggered as a procedure jpmorgans counsel fair a by pierce i definitely thought i had exposure because i was going to be — i was being hired as the president and ceo in charge of all lines of business in the market pierce november   tr at  anne leyden then employed in jpmorgans hr department attests that she learned on november   that pierce was resigning to accept employment at charter one bank    as its president and ceo for its michigan operations leyden march   declaration ¶  at  leyden attests that she and her team worked with jpmorgans legal department to draft a memorandum concerning pierces new employment and whether pierce was in violation of the noncompete covenants id ¶¶  at  leyden attests that the memorandum which she forwarded to hr director farrell included a comparison of pierces responsibilities at jpmorgan and charter one as related to schrock by pierce and as set forth in a charter one november   press releaseid ¶¶  at  the press release reads in part charter one bank appoints sandra e pierce president and ceo of charter one bank in michigan detroit mi — charter one bank na today announced that sandra e pierce a regional executive at bank one with more than  years of experience has been appointed president and ceo of its banking operations in michigan as michigan president for charter one bank pierce will oversee  branches and more than  employees throughout the state including branch staff business bankers and commercial lenders        pierce will join the company on january   and report to tom hollister who is president and ceo of charter one bank na and a citizens financial group vice chairman in charge of midwest banking leydens january   memorandum signed by schrock and forwarded to farrell provides in relevant part on december   sandra pierce resigned from her position as midwest regional manager of consumer banking for jpmorgan chase  co jpmc to accept a position as chief executive officer and president of michigan for charter one bank sandra managed approximately  branches in her position with jpmc formerly bank one sandras responsibilities as ceo and president for charter one bank will include management responsibility for all its retail banking branches thus she will be performing duties that are substantially similar to those that she performed at jpmc charter one directly competes with jpmc in retail banking and other businesses in michigan leyden attests that she discussed the circumstances of pierces resignation and the memorandum with farrell who then approved the clawback recommendation leyden march   declaration ¶¶  at  farrell testified at his february   deposition that he did not recall the july   memorandum or pierce but after reading the memorandum farrell testified that he would have approved the clawback farrell february   tr at   a by farrell first i would rely on sandra pierce she is the executive vice president and runs the whole us so this is a very senior person based upon what i read here i would clearly have supported it and i agree with her id at  a july   memorandum from farrell to schrock initialed by farrell states this is to confirm the determination i made in january  adopting the recommendation of sandra schrock dated january      farrell testified that the initials on the july   memorandum were his initials farrell february   tr at  pierce herself testified q so if at any time before may   that jpmorgan chase determined that based on the press release and based upon what it knew that you would be directly responsible for retail in michigan that hence you had violated the stock agreements you wouldnt fault jpmorgan for coming to that decision based on the information it had a by pierce well thats — i would not fault jpmorgan for coming to that conclusion thats the conclusion i came to when i quit pierce november   tr at  construing the record evidence in a light most favorable to pierce it is beyond reasonable dispute that farrells clawback decision on behalf of jpmorgan was not unreasonable or irrational unconsidered taken without consideration of relevant facts and circumstances whimsical or fickle done without reason or biased but was instead the product of a deliberate reasoning process amway distributors  fd at  farrells inability to recall pierce or his own involvement with the  decision does not displace the uncontested evidence that farrell was the decisionmaker farrells lack of recall is also understandable and consistent with his testimony that he was involved in tons of such decisions involving a staggering number of dollars farrell february   tr at  farrells testimony that a clawback would be automatic with respect to highlevel executives because everybody knows the new employer will reimburse any loss does not alter that in pierces case farrell relied on the information gathered by leyden and schrock as set forth in the january   memorandum it was not arbitrary or capricious for farrell to assume that pierce as the ceo and president of michigan for charter one bank would be a member of a charter one management committee farrells testimony that the decision was not complicated suggests only that the decision was not difficult for him in light of the facts and circumstances pierces argument that schrock recommended a clawback solely because pierce was going to a competitor is belied by the january   memorandum it is also uncontested that farrell not schrock was the final decisionmaker pierces argument that the january   memorandum evidences arbitrary and capricious conduct because it is nearly identical to a september   memorandum authored by pierce recommending a clawback with respect to one michael newbold is unavailing given the similarity of newbolds new responsibilities as chief operating officer for union federal which will include management responsibilities for all its retail branches defendants march   exhibit  the gravamen of pierces argument is that once hired by charter one she ultimately did not receive responsibility for retail banking functions and therefore schrocks january   memo erroneously states that pierces charter one position includes management responsibility for all of its retail banking branches pierce asserts that jpmorgan erred because farrell did not consider pierces actual job functions at charter one the court disagrees pierce concedes in her brief opposing jpmorgans motion for summary judgment that the analysis of farrells actions must focus on what he did and knew on january   the time he supposedly made his decision april   response brief at  pierce admitted that at the time the clawback decision was made she herself concluded that she was in breach of the noncompete covenants because she would be responsible for retail banking functions at charter one pierce november   tr at  pierce candidly testified that she was hired as president and ceo running all lines of businesses for charter one in michigan then spent her first ten months at charter one arguing for retail responsibility id at  pierce also testified q do you have any reason to believe that as of may   that jpmorgan chase had any reason to believe that you in fact were not in charge of retail in the state of michigan or directly responsible for it a i dont — i cant imagine how they would have known what was going on internally id the may   date is in obvious reference to a may   letter from pierces counsel to jpmorgan explaining why pierce believed she was not subject to clawback    at jpmorgan ms pierce was the regional executive of midwest retail operations for michigan and indiana she focused solely on the retail aspect of the business and directly supervised the numerous jpmorgan branches in those states interacting with the branch management on a regular basis she had no management responsibility for any other business area including but not limited to commercial lending private banking and investment and business banking in contrast in her executive position at charter one michigan ms pierce is in charge of all operations for such bank within the state of michigan not simply retail plaintiffs march   exhibit  emphasis added even as late as may   four months after pierce left jpmorgan and nearly four months after the clawback decision had been made the information available to jpmorgan still supported a conclusion that pierce was responsible for retail functions at charter one the same or substantially similar functions she had performed at jpmorgan pierce has failed to advance language in the  plan  plan or any of the stock award agreements that would support a finding that farrell on behalf of jpmorgan was contractually required to postpone its clawback decision comrie  ad at  a reasonable person in pierces position could not have believed that jpmorgan was required to delay its clawback position for four to ten months or that jpmorgan was not entitled to rely upon the information it received from pierce and charter one rhonepoulenc  ad at  under either an arbitrary and capricious or de novo standard of review jpmorgan was not required to postpone its clawback decision until pierces actual responsibilities were internally resolved at charter one four to ten months after pierce resigned from jpmorgan schwartz  ad at  hall  wl  at  hilton hotels  fsuppd at   crider  fsuppd at  the court need not review the record to determine whether pierce now performs the same or substantially similar functions she performed at jpmorgan vi contract language arguments by pierce pierce argues that hr director farrell erred by failing to consider certain contractual contingencies specifically pierce argues that jpmorgans  merger with bank one constituted a change of control under the first april   stock award agreement and therefore all stock restrictions including the noncompete covenant lapsed pierce also maintains that a  stock gain she realized on july   under a february   restricted stock award agreement was the result of a stock restriction that lapsed on february   more than a year before she left jpmorgan pierce continues that some of the stock award agreements required that an employee violate the restrictive covenants as oppose to any of the restrictive covenants thus requiring jpmorgan to find the employee also breached a confidential information covenant to support a clawback decision pierce maintains that there is no evidence that she signed the last august   stock award agreement and because she was paid under the agreement jpmorgan waived its right to enforce the restrictive covenant as previously discussed the  plan the  plan and the stock award agreements authorized delegated decisionmaker farrell to interpret the plans and stock award agreements jpmorgans interpretation of the contracts is thus subject to a review for an exercise of good faith and reasonable discretion consistent with the language of the plans and stock award agreements schwartz  ad at  hall  wl  at  hilton hotels  fsuppd at   the april   stock award agreement provides that in the event of a change in control as defined by the plan after the date of this award all restrictions will lapse on the change of control the stock award agreement also provides under the subtitle lapse of restrictions — onehalf of the stock grant will be distributed free of restrictions upon the third and fifth anniversaries of the grant subject to continued employment and subject to restrictive covenants    further as a condition to a restricted stock grant employees such as pierce were required to agree to restrictive covenants including the covenant of not becoming employed by a competitor and performing the same or substantially similar functions as he or she performed at jpmorgan the  plan speaks to determinations regarding the grant terms of awards including    restriction or option period dividend rights postretirement and termination rights    and such other terms and conditions as the board or the committee deems appropriate a reasonable person in pierces position would conclude from this language that the restrictions that lapsed on a change of control were the restrictions on liquidating a stock grant not the restrictive covenants rhonepoulenc  ad at  stock restrictions are referred to separately from restrictive covenants the restrictive covenants are expressly a condition to a restrictive stock grant and raise issues independent of a stocks restriction or option period jpmorgans interpretation that the restrictive covenants did not lapse with the  merger of bank one and jpmorgan is consistent with the unambiguous contract language and not the result of bad faith or an abuse of discretion likewise although pierce may have realized a stock gain on july   when restrictions on stock she received under a february   restricted stock award agreement lapsed the restrictive covenants did not lapse on july   subjecting this gain to the oneyear clawback provisions when she became employed by charter one in january  each of the five stock award agreements contains a confidential information restrictive covenant and a noncompete restrictive covenant the april   stock award agreement provides if the employee violates the restrictive covenants above    the employee will be required to reimburse jpmorgan    the june   stock award agreement provides in contrast if the employee violates any of the restrictive covenants above    the employee will be required to reimburse jpmorgan    the august   and july   stock award agreements read if an employee    violates the restrictive covenants described above    the employee    will be required to reimburse jpmorgan    the august   stock award agreement states if the employee    violates any of the restrictive covenants described above    the employee    will be required to reimburse jpmorgan    a reasonable person in pierces position would interpret the language of each of these stock award agreements as requiring the reimbursement of stock option gains to jpmorgan if that person violated only the noncompete clause that is the subject of this lawsuit rhonepoulenc  ad at  under the circumstances it would be patently unreasonable to believe that the parties intended that a former jpmorgan employee would suffer no stock option consequence if he or she performed the same or substantially similar functions for a jpmorgan competitor in a manner which is or may reasonably be expected to be prejudicial to or in conflict with jpmorgan if jpmorgan could not also reasonably conclude that the employee misappropriated confidential information pierce herself did not reach the issue of confidential information in recommending a clawback with respect to one michael newbold or in reaching the same clawback conclusion as jpmorgan when she quit delaware law will not allow imprecision to alter the plain meaning of a contractual provision or to frustrate the overall plan or scheme as memorialized in a written contract interim healthcare inc v spherion corp  ad   delsuper affd  ad  delsupr oct  table jpmorgans interpretation that the restrictive covenants are independent covenants is consistent with the reasonable interpretation of the contract language and does not indicate an exercise of bad faith or an abuse of discretion pierces argument that jpmorgans lack of proof that she signed the august   stock award agreement demonstrates jpmorgan waived its right to enforce the restrictive covenants therein is not well taken the standards for finding a waiver of contractual rights under delaware law are quite exacting requiring that the facts relied upon to prove a waiver be unequivocal aeroglobal capital management llc v cirrus industries inc  ad   delsupr waiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right id jpmorgans
