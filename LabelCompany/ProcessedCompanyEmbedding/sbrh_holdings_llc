consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this quarterly report for additional detail regarding debt the following recent financing activity has a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the condensed consolidated financial statements on october   the company entered into the first amendment to the credit agreement under its term loans reducing the interest rate margins applicable to the usd term loan to adjusted libor subject to a  floor plus margin of  per annum or base rate with a  floor plus margin of  per annum on march   the company entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement expanding the overall capacity of the revolver facility to  million reducing the interest rate margin to either adjusted libor plus margin ranging from  to  or base rate plus margin ranging from  to  reducing the commitment fee to bps and extending the maturity to march  on september   we issued  million aggregate principal amount of  unsecured notes due  the  notes the proceeds from the  notes and draws on the revolver were used to repay our outstanding  unsecured notes due  the  notes and pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing the company repurchased  million aggregate principal amount of the  notes through a cash tender offer on september   with the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of  million subsequently redeemed by the company during the three month period ended january   restructuring activity we continually seek to improve our operational efficiency match our manufacturing capacity and product costs to market demand and better utilize our manufacturing resources we have undertaken various initiatives to reduce manufacturing and operating costs which may have a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the condensed consolidated financial statements the most significant of these initiatives are the gac business rationalization initiative which began in the three month period ended july   and anticipated to be incurred through september   and the hhi distribution center consolidation which began in the three month period ended april   and is anticipated to be incurred through december   see note  restructuring and related charges in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this quarterly report for additional detail table of contents nongaap measurements our consolidated and segment results contain nongaap metrics such as organic net sales and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization while we believe organic net sales and adjusted ebitda are useful supplemental information such adjusted results are not intended to replace our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should be read in conjunction with those gaap results organic net sales we define organic net sales as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates andor impact from acquisitions when applicable we believe this nongaap measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate andor acquisitions we use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year the effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the periods net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination we exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period the following is a reconciliation of reported net sales to organic net sales for the three and six month periods ended april   compared to net sales for the three and six month periods ended april   respectively april

hardware  home improvement       global pet supplies       home and garden       global auto care       total           adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management and we believe this nongaap measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments excluding certain noncash based expenses andor nonrecurring items during each of the comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest taxes depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies adjusted ebitda is also used for determining the companys debt covenant see note  debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this quarterly report for additional detail ebitda is calculated by excluding the companys income tax expense interest expense depreciation expense and amortization expense from intangible assets from net income adjusted ebitda further excludes  stock based compensation expense as it is a noncash based compensation cost see note  share based compensation in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this quarterly report for further details  acquisition and integration charges that consist of transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business see note  acquisition and integration
