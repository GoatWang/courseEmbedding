smartprocure collects purchasing data from electronic versions of purchase orders and from thousands of governmental agencies of all sizes throughout the country they then put that information into one big database which is researchable with a googletype search engine on top of it subscribers can search that database and they can find out what government agencies are buying the kinds of things they sell and what prices they pay likewise they can see what kind of business their competitors are doing jim finolio stated the following about his company what we add is a huge degree of transparency to the federal marketplace so our overarching goal is to make government purchasing very effective and efficient for government agencies and help the businesses who sell to the government

deerfield beach florida about the ripoff report below ripoff report would like to let readers know that ripoff report emailed this customer so the member business could make things right with them when a business joins the corporate advocacy program ripoff report emails everyone from the past so the member business can make things right with them of course everything within reason in order to confirm that the complaints were resolved ripoff report is copied on all responses so we can insure that the member business did right by their customer the author of the ripoff report below never responded to our offer to help them statement from smartprocure the report was incorrect in that the customer signed a written contract for  years of service including  days free service after the first month and then refused to pay any monthly payments after  days   days of which were free smartprocure agreed to waive any responsibility for years  and  as an accommodation in all fairness we believe there is no logical way a customer could assume he could pay for  month of service on a clearly documented contract with a  year term he signed and receive another  days of free service without any obligation at all for carrying out his part of the contract now to the original report that was filed  smartprocure is supposed to be a searchable database of government purchase orders to help government vendors boost sales after extremely aggressive sales tactics i agreed to try the service  on august   as i was clearly told there is no commitment  since i was hesitant about any benefits from the service i was not willing to sign up for a long term contract  i tried their system and found that there were no benefits to my company utilizing them   in early november i called to cancel my agreement  after several attempts of them trying to convince me not to cancel they sent me a copy of my signed contract and said i was obligated to pay three years of payments  on the contract it says one smartsearchannual subscription    yrs for  monthly  however i was lead to believe this was locking in the rate for the   years not committing to paying three years worth of service  nowhere on the agreement does it state i am obligated to pay the full term three years  the only statement on there is regarding renewals not termination   i continued to be harassed trying to convince me why their services were so great and repeatedly sent a copy of my agreement  nothing had changed on either end  then on march   i received  an email from dani carideo that my account was severely over due and i owed   i responded letting him know that i had closed the account several months ago that i was not using the services and i had no intention of using them again  i also reiterated that i had met my financial responsibilities with them  again i was sent a copy of my agreement and assurance that they had dedicated client service managers to help us use the service  again nothing had changed on either end   i am now being aggressively contacted by a law firm as of  trying to collect over  they claim i owe them  this company has unethical business practices and has crafted a purposely ambiguous contract in order to deceive clients into believing there is no commitment to later attempt to collect an exorbitant amount of money for a service that is mostly useless  this report was posted on ripoff report on   pm and is a permanent record located here

set the record straight rebuttals  replies author consumer employeeowner updates  rebuttals  rebuttal owner of company results of followup phone call to alex author smartprocure  usa submitted thursday march   posted thursday march   this is a note from my staff after they called alex  as you see he understands its a  year agreement but he doesnt think he is liable for payment  not sure how that seems like a reasonable position  he was also very hostile and rude  our decision is to keep this with the collections agency as weve done everything we can and its not fair to subject my people to the inappropriate and rude behavior he exhibits when we talk with him i reached out to alex and he is extremely hostile  he states that he recorded all of our calls and that the ae promised him there was absolutely no commitment  he also states that he read the pa which clearly says  years but that nowhere does it read that he would actually be liable for payment  he is not willing to pay for one year and feels he should not be held responsible for the debt  i kindly explained that we are extending a more than fair offer by waiving years    but he disagrees respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  rebuttal owner of company response from smartprocure author smartprocure  usa submitted tuesday march   posted tuesday march   my name is jeff rubenstein  im the president  ceo of smartprocure  the  goal at smartprocure is to go out of our way to help a potential client be successful with our product  when i read alexs complaint i looked into the matter thoroughly and heres what i found on thursday august th at pm eastern time we had our first conversation with alex  it was a call that one of our staff made to him to introduce the capabilities of smartprocure  a demo was set up for monday august th at which point alex called smartprocure to see the product  we logged him into our system through the screensharing application joinme and proceeded to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the product this was a call that lasted  minutes and at the conclusion of the call he asked to purchase the product  we sent him a formal agreement via docusign at which point he signed the agreement and initialed the terms of service  as alex indicated in his post the document clearly stated it was an annual subscription  due to him being a small company we allowed him to pay monthly as a special exception  we typically dont allow that for these reasons what alex did not mention was that he also asked for another  months for free which we granted  he made his first payment on august th  then received another  months of service for free then as he indicated in his post called to cancel in november after his extra  days were up  im at a loss to understand why he didnt think this was even an annual agreement at the least considering it clearly stated it was an annual agreement for a  year term his position that smartprocure sent a signed agreement for him to sign that said it was an annual agreement and a year term so he could lock in the price doesnt make much sense if he also isnt locked in  what company has a client sign an agreement with that language so the client is protected for  years against any price increases yet they could cancel at anytime  and why would a company provide  days for free at the beginning of the agreement if there was no obligation to continue i consider myself a reasonable and fair person  i understand that there can be miscommunications and sometimes there is not a meeting of the minds  however when someone takes a position that is so counter to what is reasonable its difficult to rationalize in the interest of being fair and reasonable i plan on asking my folks to contact alex and waive any responsibility for years  and   however there is no fair basis at which to assume he could pay for  month of service on clearly documented annual contract with a  year term he signed and receive another  days of free service for  months payment without any obligation respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you
