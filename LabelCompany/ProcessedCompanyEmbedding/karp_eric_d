biotechnology lignin is a primary component of lignocellulosic biomass that is an underutilized feedstock in the growing biofuels industry despite the fact that lignin depolymerization has long been studied the intrinsic heterogeneity of lignin typically leads to heterogeneous streams of aromatic compounds which in turn present significant technical challenges when attempting to produce ligninderived chemicals where purity is often a concern in nature microorganisms often encounter this same problem during biomass turnover wherein powerful oxidative enzymes produce heterogeneous slates of aromatics compounds some microbes have evolved metabolic pathways to convert these aromatic species via ‘upper pathways’ into central intermediates which canmore » then be funneled through ‘lower pathways’ into central carbon metabolism in a process we dubbed ‘biological funneling’ this funneling approach offers a direct biological solution to overcome heterogeneity problems in lignin valorization for the modern biorefinery coupled to targeted separations and downstream chemical catalysis this concept offers the ability to produce a wide range of molecules from lignin this perspective describes research opportunities and challenges ahead for this new field of research which holds significant promise towards a biorefinery concept wherein polysaccharides and lignin are treated as equally valuable feedstocks in particular we discuss tailoring the lignin substrate for microbial utilization host selection for biological funneling ligninolytic enzyme–microbe synergy metabolic engineering expanding substrate specificity for biological funneling and process integration each of which presents key challenges ultimately for biological solutions to lignin valorization to be viable multiple questions in each of these areas will need to be addressed making biological lignin valorization a multidisciplinary codesign problem« less full text available opportunities and

fractionation of corn stover lignin anderson eric m  katahira rui  reed michelle   december   acs sustainable chemistry  engineering reductive catalytic fractionation rcf has emerged as an effective biomass pretreatment strategy to depolymerize lignin into tractable fragments in high yields we investigate the rcf of corn stover a highly abundant herbaceous feedstock using carbonsupported ru and ni catalysts at  and  degrees c in methanol and in the presence or absence of an acid cocatalyst hpo or an acidified carbon support three key performance variables were studied  the effectiveness of lignin extraction as measured by the yield of lignin oil  the yield of monomers in the lignin oil and  the carbohydrate retention in the residualmore » solids after rcf the monomers included methyl coumarateferulate propyl guaiacolsyringol and ethyl guaiacolsyringol the ru and ni catalysts performed similarly in terms of product distribution and monomer yields the monomer yields increased monotonically as a function of time for both temperatures at  h monomer yields of  and  were obtained at  and  degrees c respectively with nic the addition of an acid cocatalysts to the nic system increased monomer yields to  for acidified carbon and  for phosphoric acid at  degrees c the monomer product distribution was dominated by methyl coumarate regardless of the use of the acid cocatalysts the use of phosphoric acid at  degrees c or the high temperature condition without acid resulted in complete lignin extraction and partial sugar solubilization up to  thereby generating lignin oil yields that exceeded the theoretical limit in contrast using either nic or ni on acidified carbon at  degrees c resulted in moderate lignin oil yields of ca  with sugar retention values  notably these sugars were amenable to enzymatic digestion reaching conversions  at  h characterization studies on the lignin oils using twodimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatrography revealed that soluble oligomers are formed via solvolysis followed by further fragmentation on the catalyst surface via hydrogenolysis overall the results show that clear tradeoffs exist between the levels of lignin extraction monomer yields and carbohydrate retention in the residual solids for different rcf conditions of corn stover« less full

available technoeconomic basis for coproduct manufacturing to enable hydrocarbon fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass biddy mary j  davis ryan  humbird david   june   acs sustainable chemistry  engineering biorefinery process development relies on technoeconomic analysis tea to identify primary cost drivers prioritize research directions and mitigate technical risk for scaleup through development of detailed process designs here we conduct tea of a model  dry metric tonperday lignocellulosic biorefinery that employs a twostep pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis to produce biomassderived sugars followed by biological lipid production lipid recovery and catalytic hydrotreating to produce renewable diesel blendstock rdb on the basis of projected nearterm technical feasibility of these steps we predict that rdb could be produced at a minimum fuel selling price mfsp of usd gasolinegallonequivalent gge predicated onmore » the need for improvements in the lipid productivity and yield beyond current benchmark performance this cost is significant given the limitations in scale and high costs for aerobic cultivation of oleaginous microbes and subsequent lipid extractionrecovery in light of this predicted cost we developed an alternative pathway which demonstrates that rdb costs could be substantially reduced in the near term if upgradeable fractions of biomass in this case hemicellulosederived sugars are diverted to coproducts of sufficient value and market size here we use succinic acid as an example coproduct the coproduction model predicts an mfsp of usd gge when leaving conversion and yield parameters unchanged for the fuel production pathway leading to a change in biorefinery rdb capacity from  to  mm ggeyear and  mm tons of succinic acid per year additional analysis demonstrates that beyond the nearterm projections assumed in the models here further reductions in the mfsp toward gge which would be competitive with fossilbased hydrocarbon fuels are possible with additional transformational improvements in the fuel and coproduct trains especially in terms of carbon efficiency to both fuels and coproducts recovery and purification of fuels and coproducts and coproduct selection and price overall this analysis documents potential economics for both a hydrocarbon fuel and bioproduct process pathway and highlights prioritized research directions beyond the current benchmark to enable hydrocarbon fuel production via an oleaginous microbial platform with simultaneous coproduct manufacturing from lignocellulosic

enables rapid analysis of acids in complex biomassderived streams munson matthew s  karp eric m  nimlos claire t   september   acs sustainable chemistry  engineering biomass conversion processes such as pretreatment liquefaction and pyrolysis often produce complex mixtures of intermediates that are a substantial challenge to analyze rapidly and reliably to characterize these streams more comprehensively and efficiently new techniques are needed to track species through biomass deconstruction and conversion processes here we present the application of an emerging analytical method gradient elution moving boundary electrophoresis gembe to quantify a suite of acids in a complex biomassderived streams from alkaline pretreatment of corn stover gembe offers distinct advantages over common chromatographyspectrometry analytical approaches in terms of analysis time sample preparation requirements and cost of equipmentmore » as demonstrated here gembe is able to track  distinct compounds oxalate formate succinate malate acetate glycolate protocatechuate hydroxypropanoate lactate glycerate hydroxybutanoate hydroxybenzoate vanillate pcoumarate ferulate sinapate and acetovanillone the lower limit of detection was compound dependent and ranged between  and  umoll results from gembe were similar to recent results from an orthogonal method based on gcxgctofms altogether gembe offers a rapid robust approach to analyze complex biomassderived samples and given the ease and convenience of deployment may offer an analytical solution for online tracking of
