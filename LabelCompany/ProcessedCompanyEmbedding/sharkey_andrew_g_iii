pull the plug on the presidents steel program the rushford report archives andrew g sharkey iii why pull the plug  on the president�s steel program   june 0 publius by greg rushford published in the rushford report on february 2 i criticized the domestic steel lobby in a speech in florida to the th annual tampa steel conference which was hosted by the tampa port authority i said basically that the us mills were quick to accuse foreigners of �dumping� and of benefiting from generous government subsidies � while themselves engaging in the same practices see what does the stand up for steel lobby really stand for the rushford report march 0             there are always two sides of any story of course i�m happy to print a response written by andrew g sharkey iii the president and ceo of the american iron and steel institute mr sharkey�s guest column explains why he thinks that we critics are wrong             mr sharkey�s analysis follows             any attempt to analyze accurately the effectiveness of president bush�s threepart steel program must take into account the factors that caused the american steel crisis as well as the lengthy deliberations the administration undertook before launching this steel tariff remedy in march of              the origins of the steel crisis are well documented most production by large nonus steel mills as much as 8 has not been marketbased production has often been subsidized cartelized governmentowned or governmentcontrolled since 80 alone foreign subsidies have totaled more than  billion             for decades nearly every foreign steel market has been protected by high tariffs quotas restrictive licensing agreements domestic cartels international milltomill agreements and other private anticompetitive behavior this made the united states the largest most open market in the world and deluged it with subsidized and dumped steel very often sold far below the real cost of production   us commitment to rulesbased trade the president is committed to enforcing us laws consistent with the requirements of the world trade organization wto to promote trade based on genuine comparative advantages and to combat the destructive consequences of subsidized injurious and dumped imports on american industries             world trade organization wto rules recognize when imports cause harm to competing domestic industries temporary restraints may be imposed to permit orderly adjustment and restructuring notwithstanding the systematic bias of wto panels against the use of trade laws these wtosanctioned trade actions include section 2type �safeguard� provisions for industries when �increased imports� are a �substantial cause� of �serious injury�   section 2 as one part of a threepart plan in june  the president announced a threepart steel action plan and initiating the 2 investigation was only one part of this plan             regarding the 2 the president asked the international trade commission itc an independent and bipartisan body to investigate whether the us steel industry suffered serious injury from increased imports with imports having driven  american steel companies  million net tons or over  of total us steel capacity into bankruptcy and having destroyed more than  us iron and steel worker jobs the itc came back with a unanimous �yes� all six commissioners said that increased imports were a substantial cause of serious injury to the us steel industry and five of the six recommended a tariff remedy             the united states followed wto rules scrupulously throughout the grueling eightmonth 2 process procedural steps were taken all along the way to protect the interests of parties on both sides this includes customers and consumers whose interests were carefully considered at all stages of the process   program is working as intended it is useful to recount some of the accusations levied before the administration program was enacted critics   �           questioned the industry�s longterm viability and argued that any relief would come too late to make a significant difference   �           claimed section 2 relief would simply prop up existing enterprises and prevent consolidation and restructuring within the industry and   �           predicted section 2 relief would undermine international negotiations on steel trade issues               now more than a year later it is clear that the program is working as intended section 2 relief has brought badly needed stability to domestic steel producers we have seen a modest but necessary price recovery that has had a positive impact on the bottom line of domestic steel producers             the president�s steel program has also helped to facilitate steps toward a fundamental consolidation and restructuring us steel has just completed the purchase of the assets of national steel corporation a new company international steel group isg has invested heavily in the industry buying most of the assets of ltv and bethlehem steel as well as selected assets of acme steel nucor has purchased the assets of trico and birmingham steel steel dynamics inc bought qualitech steel�s assets and the galvpro ii llc galvanizing facility gerdau sa north american acquired costeel�s assets             if the section 2 tariffs are kept in place for their full threeyear term us steelmakers will have the opportunity to follow through on restructuring and the industry will be dramatically more efficient than when the process began for example isg has already cut costs by  percent at the ltv mills it has reorganized             the president�s steel program also jumpstarted oecd talks on steel trade where about 0 governments are today actively negotiating a longterm agreement to ban most subsidies to steel producers participating governments are also discussing solutions to the endemic problem of massive excess steel capacity worldwide these issues are finally being taken seriously � thanks in large part to the steel program the united states has put in place             even with these positive signs domestic producers remain extremely vulnerable in part owing to the large number of exclusions from the relief imports of finished steel were higher in  than in  the current economic slowdown has left us with weak demand and not surprisingly these factors have pushed down prices substantially from their peaks of last summer for many producers the effort to return to sustained profitability has been difficult and remains uncertain             no industry can be expected to recover in little more than a year from the kind of injury the steel industry has endured over the last three decades and access to capital would dry up in a heartbeat if tariffs were ended prematurely if this industry is to be given the opportunity it needs to recover and restructure it is critical that the section 2 relief remain in place for its full threeyear duration facts don�t support complaints by foreign producers and certain steel consumers critics of the president�s remedy claim higher steel prices since section 2 relief was implemented have put us steelusing industries at a competitive disadvantage the facts do not support this claim             over the last  months as restructuring has lowered us production costs prices for critical �bench market products� such as hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized steel have risen substantially more in foreign markets than in the united states today it is less expensive to buy steel for fabrication in auto parts appliance and other industries than it is in most of europe and asia              the fallacy in critics� reasoning is the assumption of a zerosum game in which any policy that benefits steel producers must harm our customers us manufacturers need reliable sources of competitively priced steel and a reconstituted and more efficient domestic steel industry will give them that             for over one hundred years americans have played a leading role in the global steel industry america �s steelmakers are determined to carry this tradition into a new century             the last few years have been difficult but we are turning the corner we will need to preserve and strengthen rulesbased trade for all us industries however thanks in large part to section 2 relief we see a new day for american steel making a day when american steelmakers can compete with anyone in the world        top       andrew g sharkey iii  ceo founder businessman  profile directorpedianet  list of ceos founders board
