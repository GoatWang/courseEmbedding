printing system this system makes it possible to produce objects with a size of  x  x  meters at a build speed that is up to three times faster than earlier systems while maintaining the same resolution at the international trade fair for foundry technologies ‘’gifa’’ voxeljet introduced the worlds first continuous d printer the vxc the development of this continuous d printing technology represented the manufacturing of molds and models without tools this machine generation runs the process steps building and unpacking in parallel without having to interrupt system operations therefore this printing system represents an important step towards industrial series production on the basis of a generative production process in the same year voxeljet celebrated the global premiere of its d printer vx at euromold the trade fair for tooling and moldmaking design and product development in frankfurt am main by combining high performance and a large build space this printing system was able to meet the growing requirements of industry in addition to these system innovations the company also presented the newly developed material system polypor type c in the year  it allows voxeljet to meet customer demand for pure white plastic models moreover this material also satisfies higher requirements regarding the stability and surface properties of the models a year later in  the first vx printing system was sold to the british company propshop model makers ltd it was the fifth voxeljet system that was in use in the united kingdom the movie industry opened a

massachusetts institute of technology in  and is generally known as the powder bed and inkjet head d printing as usual in the additive manufacturing processes the part to be printed is built up from many thin cross sections of the d model an inkjet print head moves across a bed of powder simultaneously putting down a liquid binding material after that a thin layer of powder is extended across the completed section and the process is repeated several times with each layer adhering to the last application areaedit the voxeljet process is particularly wellsuited for the production of molds or

materials based on pmma particles bound by different resins the polypor b binder available as a voxeljet service and for system customers in europe is ideal for parts that are true to detail and which require a high degree of edge sharpness resolution and green compact strength the polypor c binder on the other hand lends itself to simplified burnout processes in investment casting and for architectural models the sand types are selected individually for each order depending on the geometry and application purpose voxeljet uses different sands with different granulations the grain size

extremely important to us that all components are operating precisely and durably here we can rely on rexroth expertise bastian heymel voxeljet ag solved with rexoth linear modules mkrnn with tooth belt drives and mkknn with ball screw drives content voxeljet d printer with highly durable precision linear technology from bosch rexroth precision in three dimensions established in  and situated in friedberg germany voxeljet ag is one of the most renowned international providers of technologies for additive manufacturing solutions today the enterprise which has also set up a branch office in the us in  produces several different models of d printers including an industrial largeformat machine the extraordinary precision and durability of voxeljet products is largely due to prefinished linear systems and profiled rail guides from rexroth   d printing revolutionizes manufacturing processes in many ways even the most complex geometrics with undercuts can be realized with the utmost precision – quietly and cleanly without any waste chips or use of cooling lubricants on a cartesian axis system the print head moves along exactly defined paths over a box filled with sand or plastic particles it uses more than  microscopic nozzles to spray an anorganic agent onto the particles to bind them and produce components e g for the automotive sector layer by layer in order to achieve the required precision and stability during the printing process voxeljet ag takes advantage of prefinished linear modules from rexroth consisting of aluminium profiles with integrated and especially durable bshp highprecision ball rail systems fast and highly precise the  kg print head of the machine vx is guided along the yaxis by means of a gantry axis with two rexroth toothbelt driven mkrnn linear modules – at traversing speeds of up to  ms along the xaxis an mkknn linear module with ball screw drive facilitates the positioning of the print head with a repeat accuracy of  mm rexroth ball rail systems are used to guide the sand box along the zaxis the backlashfree roller rail systems are suitable for micromovements between  and  μm and high loads up to  kg even higher precision can be facilitated by means of the linear module mkrnn with an integrated ­measuring system msii which will be tested in the near future this configuration allows the positioning of the print head with repeat accuracies of  μm which previously required the use of glass scales   download text       to the top facebook youtube linkedin newsletter imprint privacy legal certificates purchasing and logistics  bosch
