selected residentialhotels economic incentives   the beginning at age  max stern was ambitious but nearly penniless his native germany was suffering from the effects of hyperinflation unemployment and civil unrest in part caused by the collapse of germany after world war i by contrast america presented an island of stability freedom and economic opportunity max looked toward the promise that was america and decided to emigrate and pursue the american dreamat about the same time a childhood friend of max a local canary dealer who had previously borrowed a modest sum from him told max that he could only pay back the loan with  singing canaries max accepted the canaries and decided to sell them in new york city where he was told he could get the best pricemax negotiated free passage for himself to new york on the hamburg american steamship line in return for paying the freight charges on the canaries and spent his time below deck during the voyage caring for the birds he arrived in america not knowing a single soul or word of english a great salesman he immediately sold the canaries to the john wanamaker department stores pet department at astor place in manhattan which had the citys largest pet shop seeing the opportunity he immediately decided to establish a new business of importing canaries making his place of business nearby at  cooper square we proudly still own that building ×   growth in the pet industry max returned to his native germany again and again each time bringing back more singing canaries soon he was selling them to a growing customer base across the country including rh macy sears roebuck fw woolworth w t grant ss kresge and other large chain retailersby  max was the largest livestock importer in america and started manufacturing packaged bird foods at  cooper square selling them under the hartz mountain brand to the same customers who bought canaries from him and the line of hartz mountain pet products was born ×   the second generation by now hartz mountain had become americas best known bird food company max welcomed his yearold son leonard into the business who immediately took over daytoday operations as maxs health had started to fail leonard appreciated the success of the bird food line but he also knew that americans needed food and supplies for their other pets so he rapidly expanded the hartz product line offering supplies for dogs cats fish and other household pets this expansion had far more growth potential than bird products and sales boomed accordingly hartz then pioneered a revolutionary type of pet supply distribution using specialized display racks installed in the pet food section of supermarkets which revolutionized the american pet industryhartz products were heavily advertised first on radio and then television creating the most powerful brand in the pet industry “perk up your parakeet with hartz mountain parakeet seed read one ad during this time hartz developed numerous unique and creative

bottom content ‭hidden‬ page styles   the beginning at age  max stern was ambitious but nearly penniless his native germany was suffering from the effects of hyperinflation unemployment and civil unrest in part caused by the collapse of germany after world war i by contrast america presented an island of stability freedom and economic opportunity max looked toward the promise that was america and decided to emigrate and pursue the american dream at about the same time a childhood friend of max a local canary dealer who had previously borrowed a modest sum from him told max that he could only pay back the loan with  singing canaries max accepted the canaries and decided to sell them in new york city where he was told he could get the best price max negotiated free passage for himself to new york on the hamburg american steamship line in return for paying the freight charges on the canaries and spent his time below deck during the voyage caring for the birds he arrived in america not knowing a single soul or word of english a great salesman he immediately sold the canaries to the john wanamaker department stores pet department at astor place in manhattan which had the citys largest pet shop seeing the opportunity he immediately decided to establish a new business of importing canaries making his place of business nearby at  cooper square we proudly still own that building  cooper square hartz pet products   circa  circa  max sternfounder     growth in the pet industry hartz bird food products  fw woolworth was our largest customer by max returned to his native germany again and again each time bringing back more singing canaries soon he was selling them to a growing customer base across the country including rh macy sears roebuck fw woolworth w t grant ss kresge and other large chain retailers by  max was the largest livestock importer in america and started manufacturing packaged bird foods at  cooper square selling them under the hartz mountain brand to the same customers who bought canaries from him and the line of hartz mountain pet products was born     the second generation by now hartz mountain had become americas best known bird food company max welcomed his yearold son leonard into the business who immediately took over daytoday operations as maxs health had started to fail leonard appreciated the success of the bird food line but he also knew that americans needed food and supplies for their other pets so he rapidly expanded the hartz product line offering supplies for dogs cats fish and other household pets this expansion had far more growth potential than bird products and sales boomed accordingly hartz then pioneered a revolutionary type of pet supply distribution using specialized display racks installed in the pet food section of supermarkets which revolutionized the american pet industry hartz products were heavily advertised first on radio and then television creating the most powerful brand in the pet industry
