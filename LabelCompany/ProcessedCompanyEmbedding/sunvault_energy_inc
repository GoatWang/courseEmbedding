energy graphene based supercapacitor will compete with tesla battery plans sunvault energy graphene based supercapacitor will compete with tesla battery plans apr    et from sunvault energy inc kelowna bc april   prnewswire  sunvault energy inc sunvault the company svlt was recently at the wall street conference in miami florida where ceo gary monaghan and sunvault director governor bill richardson addressed the audience on recent company developments at the conference the company presented a  farad graphene supercapacitor – the largest graphene supercapacitor developed to date and a technology that will in short order compete with if not potentially replace the lithium battery in the future the  farad graphene supercapacitor was created through one of sunvaults joint venture companies supervault energy a  jv between sunvault energy and nanotech energy inc at the conference ceo gary monaghan was quoted as follows currently the cost to manufacture a lithium battery is about  usd per kwh tesla recently announced a super factory to be built in nevada with a promise to get the price of lithium batteries down to  usd per kwh by  our current cost estimated for this type of graphene base supercapacitor is about  per kwh today and we feel confident we should be able to cut this pricing in half by the end of  graphene based supercapacitors are carbon based and form no toxicity threat to the environment unlike the lithium battery stated gary monaghan there is ample supply of graphene or elements to make graphene while lithium supplies are dwindling he continued at the conference the company displayed the ability to d print device parts which can significantly reduce manufacturing costs the ability to wire these devices together results in a unit that would be approximately the size of a computer tower that would be able to store enough energy to power a home this would work in conjunction with sunvaults planned stand up solar appliance for power generation that would be slightly larger than an air conditioning unit and could supply the much publicized home off the grid potential of the future announced recently by others the company believes its solar appliance device plans far surpasses the roof full of solar panel approach for ease of entry and removes the barrier to entry that potentially resides in most consumers minds because of the construction project approach they currently face for deployed solar   the ability to fast charge devices with pseudosupercapacitor units versus a slower energy release of lithium ion batteries will impact the smart phone electric car power grid stabilization and home off the grid markets  in layman terms  a smart phone that will be charged in under a minute and an electric car can both be powered by the graphene pseudosupercapacitor that can fast charge more rapidly than any battery and effectively last a life time will significantly change the landscape of the future in every decade there is some breakthrough technology that will significantly impact the world and its future sunvault believes for this decade that breakthrough is graphene and all of its potential uses the company is also looking at other joint venture opportunities for the deployment of graphene base heating and power storage systems and has started to look for areas to set up manufacturing for products that are ready to go to market   the following video outlines some of how graphene can impact the world going forward clickvideo about sunvault energy inc sunvault energy inc is committed to bringing cost
