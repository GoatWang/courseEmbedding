secondary color blue great for living rooms offices and more about john palmer john ross palmer blends symbolic color form and textures into an art form he describes as escapism palmer transports the viewer within his reductive canvases with the use of understated and abstract forms palmers work depicts forms that hint at reference but leave interpretation open to the viewer studying in florence under philip rubinovjacobson gave me the opportunity to open the door to more free forms in my work and add the flexibility to allow the viewer to be an integral part states palmer through this

international school of art in florence under master philip rubinovjacobson and roberto venosa in cadaques spain one of palmers focuses today is the ability to share his art in areas of deeper meaning

pets at home that you dont want to play with longer curtains when selecting curtains and drapes you need to know both the length and the width you need for the space as well as if you want them to have tiebacks or have certain properties like odor neutralizing and energy efficiencyanother common window treatment is the use of blinds and shades blinds are especially functional because they make it easy to control how much light comes in through the windows and you can adjust them depending on the time of day many shades are made from wood wood composite or synthetic wood but there are shades made from vinyl metal and bamboo as well depending on the blinds they generally rest inside the window frame so youll need to know the length and width of your window frame before selecting them as well as deciding whether you want vertical or horizontal blinds shades often work in conjunction with drapes or curtains and are ideal for keep sunlight out especially on hot days these also go inside
