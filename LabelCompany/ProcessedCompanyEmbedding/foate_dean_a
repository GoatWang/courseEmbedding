comments before turning the call over to todd and pat for further details let me now turn the call over to dean foate dean dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you susan and good morning everyone yesterday after the close of the market we reported results for our fiscal third quarter of  revenue was  million at the highend of our guidance range our nongaap diluted eps result was  above our guidance range due to strong operating performance overall revenue grew approximately  sequentially and played out largely as expected across our sectors notably new program ramps drove strong sequential growth in our industrialcommercial sector and to some extent in our healthcarelife sciences sector overall i am pleased with our performance this quarter and i am especially gratified that we delivered operating margins solidly in our target range of  to  one quarter ahead of earlier expectations the stronger margin performance in combination with better balance sheet management resulted in roic improving to  or  basis points of economic return consequently free cash flow was above expectations for the quarter shifting our focus to topline growth new business wins were again healthy this quarter providing optimism for accelerating growth in the coming fiscal year i will now turn the call over to todd todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you dean good morning everyone advancing to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance on slide four after exceptionally strong sequential growth in our fiscal third quarter we expect revenue growth to moderate in the fiscal fourth quarter were guiding fiscal fourth quarter revenue in the range of  million to  million as new program ramps in our industrialcommercial and defensesecurityaerospace market sectors offset anticipated nearterm endmarket weakness in our networkingcommunications sector we expect our operating margin to be near the highend of our  to  target range for the second consecutive quarter as a result of the excellent work by our teams in delivering our cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives with our sustained operating performance and the expected revenue level were guiding nongaap diluted eps in the range of  to  this includes  of stockbased compensation expense next i would like to turn to operating performance on slide five our fiscal third quarter revenue which was at the highend of our guidance range at  million was up  sequentially from q we benefited from modest strengthening within the quarter across all our sectors with the exception of defensesecurityaerospace our operating margin finished near the top end of our target range at  as our three manufacturing regions continued to deliver meaningful results associated with our cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives as a result of the strong revenue and operating margin in q we delivered record adjusted operating profit of  million as we look forward to q we expect we will continue this level of operating performance please advance to slide six for additional insight into our recent operating margin performance as discussed on previous calls at the beginning of our fiscal first quarter of  weve put in place plans to improve operating profit  million to  million per quarter by our fiscal third quarter of  resulting in a  basis point to  basis point improvement to operating margin we finished our fiscal third quarter at the highend of our target range with  basis points of total improvement when including the  basis point improvement resulting from the successful guadalajara ramp we exited the quarter at  operating margin looking ahead to our fiscal fourth quarter of  we will complete our nearterm cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives with the closure of the fremont facility the end result of these combined efforts will be a  basis point improvement to operating margin positioning us to maintain performance in our  to  target operating margin range looking to the future we anticipate additional positive margin benefit as a result of achieving sustained growth in the emea region we believe we are wellpositioned to fund our future growth investments while achieving our target operating margin range please advance to slide seven for insight into the performance of our market sectors during the fiscal third quarter of  as well as our expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter our networkingcommunications sector was down  in q which was in line with our expectations of down low singledigits three of our top customers outperformed prior forecast the remainder of the sector was mixed to expectations looking to q we expect networkingcommunications revenue to be down in the low doubledigit percentage point range due to nearterm endmarket weakness and headwinds associated with the previously announced program completion demand within the sector remains volatile our healthcarelife sciences sector was up  sequentially in q which was better than our expectations of a midsingledigit increase overall demand exceeded expectations with  of the top  customers with one customer stronger than forecast to support a program transition to another plexus site looking ahead to the fiscal fourth quarter we anticipate revenue in our healthcarelife sciences sector to be down in the low singledigits relative to q we see endmarket weakness with two larger customers an unfavorable product mix shift with another significant customer and a more normalized run rate with a program transition mentioned earlier these impacts are somewhat offset by new program ramps our industrialcommercial sector was up  sequentially in our fiscal third quarter slightly above our expectations of up high teens the strong results were primarily driven by new program ramps with a major customer as we look ahead to q we currently anticipate that our industrialcommercial sector will be up in the high singledigit percentage point range on the strength of new program wins with several customers in the sector our defensesecurityaerospace sector was flat in q a result that was largely in line with expectations as demand softened slightly within the quarter we currently expect q to be up in the midsingledigits sequentially mainly due to endmarket strength of a security customer and new program ramps next to new business wins on slide eight during the fiscal third quarter we won  new programs in our manufacturing solutions group that we anticipate will generate  million in annualized revenue when fully ramped in production the result is well above our goal and our strongest since the second quarter of fiscal  the wins for our americas and apac region were robust at  million and  million respectively our wins result in our emea region was below expectations and our team is focused on improvement actions please advance to slide nine for further insight into the wins performance of our market sectors in the fiscal third quarter our manufacturing solutions wins were led by the industrialcommercial sector the wins included significant business expansions with a top customer and a new division of an existing customer our healthcarelife sciences sector also won a significant program with a new customer and further expanded our relationship with one of our top customers healthcarelife sciences and industrialcommercial sectors continued their trend of wins momentum well above our  goal supporting our strategy to further shift our business mix and deliver a healthier differentiated portfolio now advancing to manufacturing wins momentum on slide  our trailing fourquarter manufacturing wins as shown by the dark blue bars is at  million this performance results in a wins momentum of  above our target of  and a  basis point improvement from last quarter our engineering solutions wins totaled approximately  million in the fiscal third quarter a strong result that was in line with our expectations the funnel for engineering solutions continues to be robust and we expect another strong quarter of wins in the fiscal fourth quarter our backlog in our higher margin engineering solutions organization remains quite healthy please advance to slide  our manufacturing funnel remains robust at  billion of qualified opportunities the sector breakdown of our funnel supports the revenue goals of our differentiated portfolio i will now turn the call to pat for a detailed review of our financial performance pat patrick j jermain  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you todd and good morning everyone our fiscal third quarter results are summarized on slide  revenue of  million was at the highend of our guidance due to better performance from three of our market sectors gross margin of  was within our guidance and  basis points above the fiscal second quarter our continuing efforts to manage costs and improve productivity while increasing our topline contributed to the gross margin expansion selling and administrative expense of approximately  million was at the topend of our guidance primarily due to higher variable incentive compensation for the third quarter sga as a percentage of revenue was approximately  which was consistent with the fiscal second quarter we are pleased to achieve our target operating margin range this quarter before restructuring our adjusted operating margin of  was at the topend of our guidance and included approximately  basis points of stockbased compensation we experienced minimal impact from foreign exchange volatility as we continue to hedge significant balance sheet exposures the devaluation of the british pound had no significant impact on our fiscal third quarter as we utilize an average exchange rate to translate income statement results during the fiscal fourth quarter we anticipate that the currency devaluation will have a minor impact overall as less than  of plexus revenue is generated in the uk diluted eps of  includes a  per share detriment as a result of aftertax restructuring charges of  million related primarily to the closure of our fremont california facility excluding restructuring charges nongaap eps of  exceeded our guidance of  to  turning now to the balance sheet on slide  return on invested capital was  for the fiscal third quarter  basis point improvement from the prior quarter and  basis points above our fiscal  weighted average cost of capital of  a stronger margin performance combined with disciplined invested capital management drove the improvement in our return on invested capital performance during the quarter we purchased approximately  of our shares for  million at a weighted average price of  per share the shares were purchased under our  million stock repurchase program we have approximately  million remaining under the authorization which we plan to use to repurchase shares on a relatively consistent basis over the fiscal fourth quarter during the quarter our board of directors authorized  million multiyear stock repurchase program which reflects our continued commitment to maximize shareholder value by returning excess cash to shareholders this program will commence in fiscal  and repurchases will be dependent on market conditions as discussed in the press release on july  we amended our senior unsecured credit agreement to take advantage of favorable pricing as a result of the amendment the credit facility was expanded to  million with the ability to increase it by an additional  million the amended facility provides us with ample borrowing capacity and flexibility in anticipation of future growth and in part to fund the previously announced share repurchase program in addition to the expansion we extended the termination date of the credit facility from may  to july  during the quarter we generated  million in cash from operations and spent  million on capital expenditures resulting in free cash flow of  million this result exceeded our  million to  million free cash flow guidance for the fiscal third quarter lower capital expenditures and continued emphasis on working capital management contributed to the improvements in free cash flow cash cycle at the end of the third quarter was  days a sequential improvement of three days and favorable to the midpoint of our guidance please turn to slide  for details on our cash cycle days in inventory were sequentially down four days driven by the higher revenue for the fiscal third quarter inventory increased approximately  million or  compared to the  revenue increase sequentially days in receivables were up three days due to a higher level of shipments at the end of our quarter and a mix change to customers with less favorable payment terms sequentially payable days were consistent while customer deposit days increased two days as we secured  million in additional deposits as todd has already provided the revenue and eps guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter i will now turn to some additional details which are summarized on slide  we expect additional restructuring charges of approximately  million to  million in the fiscal fourth quarter primarily related to our fremont california facility these restructuring charges are excluded from the guidance discussed today we have also excluded from our guidance any charges related to special items which are not known or reasonably quantifiable at this time we expect all restructuring activities to be completed in fiscal  total restructuring charges are expected to be in the range of  million to  million for the year gross margin is expected to be in the range of  to  the midpoint of this guidance suggests a sequential increase of  basis points driven primarily by a sequential increase in variable incentive compensation expense we expect sga dollars in the fiscal fourth quarter to be slightly higher in the range of  million to  million fiscal fourth quarter adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of  to  which includes approximately  basis points of stockbased compensation expense the midpoint of this guidance suggests a slight sequential improvement to our margin and positions us at the topend of our target operating margin range a few other notes depreciation expense for the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to be approximately  million consistent with the fiscal third quarter before restructuring charges and other special items we estimate an effective tax rate of  to  for the fiscal fourth quarter and  to  for the full year the slightly higher tax rate forecasted for the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the third quarter is largely attributed to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings our expectation for the balance sheet is a sequential increase in working capital dollars cash cycle days are expected to be in the range of  days to  days for the fiscal fourth quarter suggesting a sequential increase of three days at the midpoint of this guidance the increase in working capital dollars and cash cycle days is primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable due to a continued mix change to customers with less favorable payment terms we expect free cash flow in the range of  million to  million for the fiscal fourth quarter as a result we are increasing our fiscal  expectation of free cash flow by  million at the midpoint our new range is  million to  million fiscal  capital spending is anticipated to be approximately  million which will support new program ramps and productivity improvements with that sylvia i will now open the call for questions we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one followup sylvia questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session our first question comes from matt sheerin from stifel matthew sheerin  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes thank you and good morning everyone just a question regarding the networkingcommunications business it sounds like a rather soft outlook there and it also seems like its going to have a positive effect on your overall margins due to mix but if that sector continues to weaken on lower volumes what should we think about the negative leverage within that business offset by positive mix because revenue in the other sectors just by defaults are higher as a percentage todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure so matt this is todd ill take this question so first of all with respect to the networkingcommunications business we have a soft outlook in q and in this case were seeing seven of our top  customers weakening we also have the impact of the program disengagement that we talked about in the past as a headwind but as we look to q and really the balance of f – or f we see the networkingcommunications sector recovering so we would expect at this point q to look much like q does from a revenue standpoint and we do see growth within that sector in fiscal  although not necessarily at the rate of our other sectors so i think youll continue to see it from a percentage of our portfolio standpoint to be at or trend slightly lower than the other sectors as we continue to grow the other sectors but we do expect growth within that sector and we view this as really a shortterm issue matthew sheerin  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then after deselecting some of the lower margin or less desirable programs should we see margins within the net and communications business improve through next year as volumes start to come back todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president well i think we look at it overall as a portfolio across plexus and again were really driving toward this  to  target operating margin on really a consistent quarterly basis so thats the way we look at running the business certainly some of the things that we did in networkingcommunications helped that profile and helped us get to that range where were at in q and q as well but as we look forward theres other factors and pressures that come into play that drive the operating margins such as inflationary pressures within our business itself customers and their cost down pressures and cost pressures as well as the need to really focus on growth and invest in growth investments so we believe that  to  is a healthy place to be a place that we expect to stay but we think were positioned well to stay in that range matthew sheerin  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay got it thanks very much operator our next question comes from sherri scribner from deutsche bank sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc hi thanks thanks for the detail on the fx impact from the pound can you give us some sense of what youre seeing in europe i know you guys dont have a ton of exposure but it seems like some of your wins were a little bit weaker in the emea region and maybe some detail on that would be helpful todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes so maybe ill let pat give a little more color around europe and the impact of brexit and such as that and then ill talk more about wins and growth in the emea region patrick j jermain  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah ill start so sherri as i mentioned q we didnt see much of an impact because we use an average exchange rate but for fiscal fourth quarter if the exchange rate continues at the level its at the british pound we would expect probably a couple million dollar impact just simply from translating results from the uk into us dollars now thats already factored into our guidance that we provided today so thats a piece just from translation we dont see much of an impact from the romania business thats a euro functional currency so just simply translating those results wouldnt result in a significant impact from a demand standpoint we are seeing some softness from our uk customers were still trying to work through whether thats brexit related or just softer endmarket demand but thats probably a couple million dollars as well so overall the impact at this point were not seeing as significant but i think wait and see how this continues to play out sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc okay todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president so next from a standpoint of wins and the revenue trajectory within the region so from a standpoint of the wins we had what we felt was an abnormally low quarter in q in the emea region and we would expect that to recover as we move forward in q and beyond so we dont view it as a longterm trend within that region and as we look at the revenue growth and if you look at the wins momentum within that region it is strong and you can probably interpolate  and do the math and see that were expecting roughly mids growth within the region in our fiscal  and as we look to fiscal  we would expect something in that region or perhaps even better sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just looking at the operating margin you guys have done a very good job of improving that and getting back into the target range – at the highend of the target range should we assume that youre in that target range for every quarter in fiscal  because if i look at the full year street numbers it implies that you guys are pretty heavily in that range for  thanks todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes i think sherri for most of the quarters well be in that range the one we typically have challenges with would be our march quarter where we have the compensation the merit increases and the us payroll tax reset and thats a quarter where i could see us tipping below that  lowend of our target range sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc thank you todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure operator our next question comes from steven fox from cross research steven fox  cross research llc thanks good morning first question just on the industrialcommercial sales performance in the quarter and the outlook so the ramp into september i guess theres a lot of plexusspecific stuff going on i was curious if theres any other seasonal factors that we should think of and given all the other markets if theres anything else you would call out within industrialcommercial thats affecting that guidance and then just any kind of hints you can provide in terms of what kind of seasonality or new program ramps we should think affecting december quarter would be helpful steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president steven this is steve frisch and ive got a little bit of a cold this morning so hopefully you can hear me steven fox  cross research llc yes steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president in regards to the new program ramps it really is the strength – is in the new program ramps were very successful at converting opportunities and theyve been ramping nicely todd talked about the one that we have a continuation with a current customer weve also talked that weve added a new division with an existing customer and we expect those to continue to ramp in  in regards to the seasonality the semiconductor market is flat to where it has been we were kind of expecting to see some growth – more growth in that as we entered the back half of  it hasnt picked up to the levels that we would have anticipated but it hasnt gone down either very similar story with oil and gas so what youre seeing for us is really growth through new program ramps and not a lot of effect of seasonality steven fox  cross research llc and was this an especially big quarter where the revenues are coming from the new programs or should we see more of that in the december quarter steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president theres a little bit of a spike as we ramp for the first time but we do expect the levels to not dip appreciably as we go through the year steven fox  cross research llc thanks and then just real quick on the new program ramps so it looks – from the margins it appears like everything is ramping efficiently im just wondering how you would grade yourselves out on some of these ramps given some of the big areas you said youve entered with new divisions et cetera is there anything thats changed in the model that has made this more predictable for you or have there been hiccups that youve been able to overcome thanks todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president i would say overall weve been efficient in the new program ramps i mean theres always challenges that occur during a new program ramp because its new its often its a new customer its always a new program it can be issues related around the design it can be issues related around process or what have you so theres always challenges to overcome but one of our key focuses has been on putting in the proper investments ahead of the ramp within our sites so i think thats helped us to be more consistent and more predictable within those ramps and we would expect to be able to continue that as we move forward dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer id just add i think todds being somewhat modest theres been an enormous i think cultural shift in the organization to really get back to performing for our customers and underpinning that is a heavy focus on operational excellence and standard work across the organization getting rid of variation and weve made an enormous move in that direction which has really helped our performance for our customers but also made the manufacturing floor much more predictable with less heroics to get product out the door at very high quality levels frankly theres quite a bit more work to do to get us up to a point where we would say that were in really excellent shape and those that would drive these sort of initiatives know that this is kind of work thats never done theres always opportunity for improvement but weve got a significant shift going on in terms of how we do work across our manufacturing platform steven fox  cross research llc thats very helpful thanks very much dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from shawn harrison from longbow research shawn m harrison  longbow research llc morning everyone i guess i just like to see if we could dig in a little bit more on networking comment it sounds from the comment that this is either a shortterm demand disruption or an inventory correction maybe if you could parse it between either and then the better view on  is that because the demand gets better or is that because some of the new program wins youve won over the past few quarters ramp and indicates whats still a soft endmarket environment todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes so shawn demand versus inventory i would call it a demand issue and when we look further out i think we see some level of recovery in the demand but were also benefiting from new program ramps as well the other advantage we have as we go forward within networkingcommunications is we dont have the headwind of the large program disengagement that we talked about to deal with any further shawn m harrison  longbow research llc i guess on that topic todd will both the program disengagements be complete exiting here in the fiscal year todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes so we talked about the two different programs the one being the industrialcommercial program and that is complete already as we speak and the networkingcommunications program you can consider that complete after this quarter just taking a quick look at the headwinds to make sure i get this right as well too so we have about a  million headwind impacting our current quarter our q and then really that trails down after that point shawn m harrison  longbow research llc okay and then just finally as a quick followup coming to the i guess or going into fiscal  do you have any additional thoughts in terms of how youre going to deploy the new larger buyback and i know at the analyst day i think you said youd be – i dont know if the right term was selective or opportunistic but right now we may be model something of  million over the next three years or is there potential to frontload it todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah i dont think theres much potential to frontload it shawn what were going through right now is our planning process both our annual planning process and our long range plan and what i look at is our intrinsic value i look at where were trading our trading multiple and make decisions based on that but at least we want to be covering our equity dilution and then setting up a strategy thats consistent and thats kind of the strategy weve had in the past just had a little larger amount going forward shawn m harrison  longbow research llc okay perfect thanks so much and congrats on the results dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you patrick j jermain  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you operator our following question comes from mitch steves from rbc capital markets mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc hey guys just a first quick one so if you were to look at the midpoint of the guide kind of call it six  or so somewhere around there i mean would you have two  customers like you had last year or is that expected to decline at the midpoint todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah id say that – well first of all we wont announce or talk about  customers until we release our k after the fiscal fourth quarter what i can say is that if you looked at the – we announced two of course last year we dont – from a percentage standpoint theyre staying relatively consistent mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it so pretty much the same as it was last year on a rough basis okay and then secondly if i look at the industrial side it looks like thats ramping up pretty materially so is there a specific i guess product line you guys are now making or how did you essentially displace the industrial headwind you had about a year ago steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president theres two – this is steve frisch theres two customers in that sector that weve been very successful with this last year one is the customer is outsourcing one so this is stuff that theyve done internally and theyve decided to go to an outsource model and weve benefited from that significantly the other customer that weve been wrapping is a takeaway from the competition so were very happy about that as well so theres two customers in there that are performing really well for us in the year todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president the one thing id add to that as well mitch is that were not seeing endmarket strength in industrialcommercial the growth that were able to achieve and the headwind were able to overcome is a result of wins and winning new programs mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it and then just one really small one so i know you guys mentioned that you expect kind of the june quarter to be the similar run rate in december for the networkingcommunications is that just mean that the product transition essentially snaps back in the december quarter im just trying to get an idea for why it goes down  and then effectively up  todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president we see some level of demand increase but we also see the impact of some new programs that were ramping right now mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it so theres no real material inflection item to call out todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president no mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you so much operator next question comes from jim suva from citi james dickey suva  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you and congratulations to you and your team at plexus your operating margin performance has been very impressive and then we compare that to your goals and youre hitting them basically very strong if not above so i guess this is more of a strategy question as you look ahead to the next year or two you kind of face roads of too good decisions do you walk away from business that could be higher sales but maybe – prevent you from taking your margins even higher or do you look at considering hey now that your scale has been ramped up a little bit restructuring is done do you look at kind of potentially taking on some margin business thats say maybe some of your competitors would take on but maybe a little bit lower margin thank you dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yes thats a good question jim because of course once were up into our margin range the story shifts to topline growth i think just philosophically the way we look at this is our drive towards shareholder value is about ever increasing economic profit and of course having our margin performance up where in the range that it is and improved working capital metrics is going to drive our roic higher here in the coming quarters because our balance sheet metric portion of that the denominator is on a fivequarter average so well see that improve and then its about driving topline growth which requires us to increase the capital base and then achieving an ever consistent return on that ever increasing capital base thats there to support higher revenues and i think one of the boundaries that we look at in terms of accepting businesses is can we achieve our operating margin over a long time – our target range over a long time with that new piece of business and fundamental to that is whether or not we think we can sustain some level of competitive advantage with that program versus our competition and so its not extraordinarily complicated we also understand that not all pieces of business from a margin standpoint are priced the same not all pieces of business require the same level of relative invested capital and so we give our sector teams some latitude to manage their portfolio but at the same time we expect them to deliver our targeted metrics kind of on an overall basis within that portfolio and so being up in the range that we are now i mean gives us a little bit of room all right to maneuver where previously it was difficult for us to really maneuver with customers and be more competitive when we needed to get additional engagement with new customers so ill expect us to start seeing acceleration of topline growth now that were in the spot that were in james dickey suva  citigroup global markets inc broker great and now that – as a different topic regarding tax rate now that youre restructuring youve done some moves there and repositioned some of your customers and facility for preferential things  like that a longrange tax rate planning how should we think about that patrick j jermain  chief financial officer  senior vice president i think jim we can probably still stay within the kind of low doubledigit range for the next few years im guiding  to  for the full year in fiscal  i would expect something similar in  maybe it ticks up a little bit as we go past f but nothing dramatic james dickey suva  citigroup global markets inc broker great thank you and congratulations to you and your teams at plexus dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you patrick j jermain  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks jim operator our following question comes from herve francois from b riley herve daniel francois  b riley  co llc hi herve francois id apologize i have a little bit of a cold dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer no were not alone in that no herve daniel francois  b riley  co llc yeah were not alone were not alone hopefully ends soon but on your healthcarelife sciences business i mean as you were giving some color commentary on the industrial business can you give similar commentary on your healthcarelife sciences is it a combination of some demand strength on your program wins that youve been seeing for those customers and as it kind of funnels into your business as well the  billion that you talked about steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president this is steve its very similar to the industrialcommercial story where a certain amount of the growth is coming from new program ramps that weve announced over the last several quarters keep in mind the ramp schedule for healthcarelife sciences is a bit longer so the stuff that were seeing ramping now are actually from wins that would go back into the beginning of the year at the end of f so that is where the strength is coming from the endmarkets is – i think todd mentioned are flattened a little bit i dont think these will evolve  but – because they dont move around a lot but we havent seen significant growth from the endmarkets themselves herve daniel francois  b riley  co llc got it got it got it thank you very much and then also when you look at some of the program wins that you had been getting from your industrial customers can you talk about the size of the wins have you seen any increase in the size of the program wins that youve been getting from some of the customers in that sector steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president yes this is steve again yeah the program wins that weve been experiencing in industrialcommercial and the two that weve kind of talked about a little bit the size of those programs are decent size programs bigger than what i would say is a traditional industrialcommercial opportunity and its really led by a couple things one is – in one case the customer decided to outsource the significant portion of their work and so that came in in a nice size chunk and the other one the product line is quite substantial so – and were solesourced on being able to build that so we won the entire project so again two really healthy sized program there i think the other part thats key here is that were also making inroads into other divisions of those entities and so we see theres a nice continued relationship with both of those customers herve daniel francois  b riley  co llc and is that having any – just lastly is that having any long lead impact would you expect it to have any kind of impact in your operating margins as these program wins – their size get a little bit bigger from the size of the product lines steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president i think from a pricing standpoint as we ramp new programs theyre always a bit more challenged on the margins because theres a lot of expenses that go into ramping a program so as weve talked about before we model the sectors and strive towards a  to  goal and so were actually a little bit more challenged in the beginning and as we ramp them up our expectation is that their performance is going to fall in to help us achieve our operating margin goals todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president the other thing id add though too is when we said our operating margin goals is  to  that includes ramping the new business that we need to fuel our growth so our expectation is that we can grow and maintain those margins herve daniel francois  b riley  co llc all right thanks very much guys nice quarter operator our next question comes from sean hannan from needham  company sean k f hannan  needham  co llc yes hi thanks can you hear me dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes sean k f hannan  needham  co llc congrats on the quarter just another set of questions around some of your wins here and particularly when i look at this slide nine that you have within the presentation just trying to get a little bit more context around when you think about the wins that have been accumulated through say the end of fiscal  is there a way if you can characterize for us how much for each of your segments is now in full production mode for those that were won through the end of fiscal  and then as we look at the groupings of wins that we have taken on here in  and especially say industrial comes to mind because youve had some good momentum there to get some context around how much of that is in play clearly the nontraditional markets take a bit longer to ramp but any more color would be helpful thanks dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer youre trying to get at how much of the revenue growth is already in the bag i guess is what youre  sean k f hannan  needham  co llc in effect but obviously if theres some color we can interpret or extrapolate for how much further momentum there could be as well steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president yeah so this is steve ill take a shot at this and what im going to say is very high level and generic because every program can be significantly different but you kind of hit on it is that networkingcommunication the ramp on those programs is – if you had to give it an average youre looking at six months so anything that we win is – we typically expect to be ramped in six months timeframe – six months to eight months healthcarelife sciences can be substantially longer it can be anywhere from probably  months to  months before we see a volume ramp defensesecurityaerospace is a similar story in terms of a length of ramp and industrialcommercial can be similar between – we can see things ramp relatively quickly six months it can be longer  months to  months especially if you look at like a semiconductor kind of customer and the caveat ill put on this is also where it comes from our healthcarelife sciences wins a lot of those are products that were designing and so the ramp schedule can be a bit longer in the case of the industrialcommercial that customer that i talked about where we – basically they decided to outsource its a pretty significant fast ramp and so thats also the challenges – is that whether or not this is a new program that theyre trying to penetrate the market or whether its existing business that were transitioning in the ramps can be all over the place so hopefully that gives you a little bit of color but its really hard to say that theres a specific one for each one todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president so sean i think ill add just a little bit more color around f too just to give you and the others a bit better idea of our view so if we go back to june when we had an investor day we painted an optimistic picture for f and beyond from a growth perspective and what i would say is we still feel that way and then we talked about the potential for solid growth in f with a goal to get to the low doubledigits we still view that as a reasonable goal its certainly too early to guide its too early to call the year because a lot of things can change in a big way but if endmarkets hold up if we dont see endmarkets crash if new program ramps go as we anticipate we expect to really grow meaningfully on a yearoveryear basis in each of our quarters we do believe that all our sectors are going to show growth within the year and thats how things are lining up at the moment sean k f hannan  needham  co llc all very helpful color thanks so much folks dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator we have no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to dean foate dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer all right well again i want to thank of course the sellside analysts who just do a fantastic job covering plexus and our story and

chief financial officer and steven frisch executive vice president and chief customer officer ill be now turning the call over to dean foate dean dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you angelo and good morning everyone yesterday after the close of the market we reportedly results for our fiscal third quarter  revenue was  million with diluted eps of  both results were consistent with our announcement of preliminary results on july  relative to our original guidance issued april  our revenue was at the low end of the range while our eps result was  below the bottom of the range before todd and pat provide further context and details regarding our performance this quarter i will summarize a few notable items on slide four while our revenue results are disappointing versus our earlier expectations we grew about  sequentially and we were up  versus the comparable quarter last year our  million revenue results set a new record for the company during the quarter we experienced modestly weaker demand in both our networkingcommunications and healthcarelife sciences sectors the networkingcommunications weakness was more disruptive to results as it occurred late in the quarter with meaningful reductions in demand carrying into our fiscal q while our miss in our defensesecurity and aerospace sector was a consequence of both modest endmarket demand weakness and more significantly these product shipments late in the quarter due to unanticipated production process constraint in one of our focus factories while we didnt achieve the financial results we set out to deliver this quarter i am pleased with our ever improving focus on providing exceptional value and execution for our customers as evidenced our net promoter scores continue to rise and this quarter were awarded six outstanding performance awards including global supplier of the year for ge healthcare additionally we achieved as quality management system certification for plexus engineering solutions in europe this certification is in support of our strategy to support higher levels of engineering valueadd to customers in the european aerospace market we made a few significant leadership changes over the course of the quarter to better position us for growth and improved execution recently we announced the appointment of oliver mihm as president of plexus emea in his new role oliver assumes responsibilities for the strategy and execution of all the aspects of plexus business in the emea region oliver is a talented and versatile leader who possesses exceptional customerfacing skills ronnie darroch who was previously pulling double duty leading plexus emea and global manufacturing solutions can now focus his exceptional talents on strategy and execution of our global manufacturing platform ronnie has recently relocated to the united states finally mike running assumed leadership over our global engineering solutions business over his long tenure at plexus mike has held a number of leadership positions in our engineering organization and is well prepared to leverage his significant portfolio skills to grow this profitable business to the  million level and beyond advancing to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance on slide five looking forward to next quarter we expect continuing endmarket weakness in our networkingcommunications sector to largely offset anticipated sequential growth in our other three market sectors we are establishing fiscal fourth quarter  revenue guidance of  million to  million achieving the midpoint of this range would bring our full year revenue growth just shy of our  enduring goal with all four sectors growing yearoveryear at this level of revenue we expect diluted eps in the range of  to  including approximately  of stockbased compensation expense but excluding any unanticipated special items i will now turn the call over to todd for some further comments about our market sectors and operating performance todd todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you dean good morning please advance to slide six for insight into the performance of our market sectors during q of fiscal  as well as our expectations for the sectors in fiscal q of  our networkingcommunications sector was up  sequentially in q which was below our expectations of a high singledigit increase two of our top customers decommitted to earlier forecast late in the quarter while performance in the remainder of the sector was mixed we expect our networkingcommunications sector to be down in the high teens percentage point range in fiscal q a dramatic change from our expectations of just a few weeks ago several of our top customers are experiencing recent weakened endmarket demand a trend consistent with what we observed with our peers while were benefiting from new program ramps the sector remains volatile and our expectations have changed significantly despite the recent contraction were still projecting doubledigit percentage growth within the sector in fiscal  our healthcarelife sciences sector was down  sequentially in q below our expectations of a low singledigit decline this marked the first time in the last seven quarters that the healthcarelife sciences demand did not strengthen within the quarter three of our top  customers underperformed to expectations within the quarter looking ahead to fiscal q we currently anticipate revenue in our healthcarelife sciences sector to be up in the low singledigits as we benefit from new program ramps while endmarket demand is muted we expect a good growth here in fiscal  within our healthcarelife sciences market sector as a result of recent program wins our industrialcommercial sector was up  sequentially in our fiscal q slightly above our expectations seven of our top  customers grew sequentially in the quarter and we benefited from the large new program ramp we highlighted last quarter we currently anticipate that our industrialcommercial sector will be up in the low doubledigit range in our fiscal q as a result of new program ramps and strengthening demand with a top customer were positioned for strong growth in this sector for fiscal  and fiscal  our defensesecurityaerospace sector was up  sequentially in q a result that was well below our expectations of high singledigit growth we experienced a production process constraint in one of our defensesecurityaerospace factories that limited our ability to complete product shipments late in the quarter were working closely with our customers to implement solutions that will reduce further impact we currently expect q to be up in the high singledigits as we benefit from strengthening demand with a top security customer and new program ramps in aerospace fiscal  remains a healthy growth year for the sector and fiscal  is also positioned well next to new business wins on slide seven during the quarter we won  new programs in our manufacturing solutions group that we anticipate will generate approximately  million in annualized revenue when fully ramped in production our wins were balanced across our three regions when reviewing the trailing four quarter wins as a percentage of the trailing four quarter revenue which is the line on the accompanying regional revenue graph each region is at a healthy ratio above our  goal our emea region has particularly strong wins momentum enhancing confidence that well meaningfully grow the region in future quarters please advance to slide eight this slide provides further insight into the wins performance of our market sectors it is important to note that there is significant volatility in the data and longerterm trends provide the most value in measuring sector performance in fiscal q our manufacturing solutions wins were particularly strong in the healthcarelife sciences market sector the team has performed well over the past three fiscal years positioning us for growth in fiscal  and beyond our manufacturing solutions wins included significant programs in microelectronics and aftermarket services two differentiating and higher margin service offerings our funnel of new business opportunities remains healthy at  billion now advancing to wins momentum on slide nine our manufacturing wins trailing four quarter performance as shown by the dark blue bars is at  million this performance results in a trailing four quarter win ratio of  relative to the trailing four quarter revenue above our target of  while not included in the wins results on the recent slides we had another good quarter in engineering solutions with new project wins totaling approximately  million our engineering wins remains very strong in our healthcarelife sciences sector where we continue to differentiate the marketplace our backlog in engineering solutions is quite healthy and its operational performance has been very good next id like to turn to operating performance on slide  we achieved record revenue in fiscal q affirming the success of our gotomarket strategy and our focus on customer service excellence operating margin finished disproportionately below expectations primarily as a result of the revenue shortfall due to process constraints in defensesecurityaerospace coupled with additional investments we made in the focus factory to address manufacturing inefficiencies our q guidance suggests relatively flat revenue and modest improvements to operating margins in fiscal q our economic return remained well within the value creation zone at  basis points please advance to slide  for additional insight into our recent operating margin performance and future expectations throughout this discussion i will move from left to right on the slide as we entered q we focused on three operational improvement priorities guadalajara ramp emea growth and aerospace and defense center of excellence ramp two of the three are progressing at or ahead of plan entering q we expected our guadalajara site to approach breakeven the site exceeded expectations and was profitable for the quarter this had a  basis point positive impact to operating margin we continue to expect to achieve corporate margin targets at the site by q of fiscal  as our annualized run rate exceeds  million customer satisfaction at the site remains very high moreover our funnel of new business opportunities at the guadalajara site which is not included in the revenue projections is quite strong in addition in fiscal q we obtained iso  sic  certification at the site iso  sic  is an important healthcarelife sciences quality standard and our teams are leveraging this accomplishment to drive new business into the facility as anticipated our path to consistent profitability in emea took a one quarter pause as a consequence of soft end markets transition delays and investments in new transitions were still on track to resume our profitability improvements in the region in fiscal q our operational results did not progress as anticipated in our aerospace and defense center of excellence within fiscal q we experienced a production process constraint that limited our ability to complete product shipments late in the quarter this had a  basis point impact to fiscal q operating margin were working with our customers on solutions to the process constraint and expect to have this resolved in fiscal q we also made additional investments over those previously communicated which had a  basis point burden on our q operating margin in order to address inefficiencies and properly service our customers in this important market these investments are positively influencing our key customer metrics which are trending favorably while we expect to begin to recover our investments in the next two quarters the complete recovery will occur over fiscal  looking forward to q we anticipate that well recover the revenue impact of the production process constraints in our aerospace and defense factory we will benefit from the revenue ramp in emea and we will continue to recover our guadalajara investment according to plan however much of these gains will be offset by underabsorption of fixed cost that we put in place during fiscal q to service the previously anticipated revenue growth in fiscal q which was just recently reduced in our forecast we will work to remove our delays at certain cost as the quarter unfolds however we anticipate regional sequential growth in the networkingcommunications and other sectors in fiscal q of  as a result of this increased leverage and continued progress in our three priorities outlined above we expect improved operating margin in fiscal q of  as we strive to meet our operating margin target range of  to  i will now turn the call over to pat for more detailed review of our financial performance pat patrick j jermain  senior vice president  chief financial officer thank you todd and good morning our fiscal third quarter results are summarized on slide  third quarter revenue of  million was at the low end of our guidance however  above the prior year third quarter gross margin was  which was below our expectations and below the fiscal second quarter gross margin of  the lower gross margin primarily related to one of our aerospace and defense focus factories where missed shipments late in the quarter impacted fixed cost absorption we also made deliberate shortterm investments in this focus factory to improve quality and manufacturing efficiencies selling and administrative expense of  million was consistent with our expectations and as a percentage of revenue was approximately  which has been the lowest level weve seen in several years this percentage has trended downward in recent history due to improved productivity and prudent management of sga expenses as we grow the top line operating margin of  sic  was below our guidance driven by the shortfall in gross margin diluted earnings per share of  was consistent with fiscal second quarter and consistent with the preliminary results provided on july  similar to last quarter the current quarter overall impact on revenue and earnings from currency fluctuations related to our european operations was less than  when compared to both our quarterly forecast and the prior year fiscal third quarter turning now to the balance sheet on slide  return on invested capital was  for the fiscal third quarter reflecting an economic return of  based on our fiscal  weighted average cost of capital of  during the quarter we repurchased approximately  shares for  million at a weighted average price of  per share the shares were purchased under our  million stock repurchase program we have approximately  million remaining under the authorization which we plan to repurchase on a relatively consistent basis over the fiscal fourth quarter during the quarter we generated  million in cash from operations and spent  million in capital expenditures resulting in free cash flow of approximately  million our cash cycle at the end of the third quarter was  days which was in line with our expectations and three days higher than our results in the fiscal second quarter please turn to slide  for details on our cash cycle sequentially days and receivables were flat which again demonstrated our focus on managing receivables days in inventory were  days sequentially up two days primarily driven by the late quarter reduction in revenue compared to our forecast accounts payable days were  days sequentially down one day due to the timing of inventory purchases and supplier payments during the quarter as dean has already provided revenue and earnings per share guidance i will now turn to some additional details on our fiscal fourth quarter  which are summarized on slide  gross margin is expected to be in the range of  to  comparable to the fiscal third quarter of  with similar revenue expected in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the third quarter we expect sequentially consistent sga expense in the range of  million to  million at the midpoint of our revenue guidance anticipated sga would be approximately  of revenue operating margin is expected to be approximately  to  for the fiscal fourth quarter as todd has discussed were forecasting continued improvement during the next few quarters with our european operations and with the rampup of our guadalajara site however the abrupt reduction in fourth quarter revenue for our networkingcommunications sector will negatively impact operating margin from the underabsorption of fixed costs were mindful of the gap in operating margin and have a sense of urgency to achieve our targeted operating margin range of  to  in order to do so we need to recover our investment in our aerospace and defense focus factory improve productivity levels and prudently manage our capital and sga spending a few other notes depreciation expense is expected to be approximately  million in the fiscal fourth quarter consistent with our fiscal third quarter we are estimating a tax rate of  to  for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year this rate has increased slightly since last quarter based on the global distribution of our earnings our expectation for the balance sheet is that working capital needs will increase slightly based on changes in our market sector mix and the abrupt reduction in our fourth quarter revenue forecast cash cycle days are expected to be in the range of  days to  days were now forecasting free cash flow in the range of  million to  million for fiscal  we expect capital spending to be approximately  million for fiscal  the majority of this capital is for equipment to support new capabilities new program ramps and the refresh of older equipment we anticipate maintaining a similar level for fiscal  with that i will open the call for questions we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one followup lorraine questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and our first question comes from brian alexander from raymond james please go ahead brian g alexander  raymond james  associates inc okay thanks good morning guys dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer hi brian brian g alexander  raymond james  associates inc i just wanted to start with the new business wins i appreciate they were balanced geographically and across segments but they were roughly  below the average weve seen over the last six quarters and i think the funnel came down as well so you didnt harvest as many as you had so is it getting more difficult on the business development front in general and are you seeing more competition for new programs from some of your larger ems peers and kind of whats your outlook for new program wins over the next few quarters steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president so brian this is steve in terms of the funnel itself its still healthy at over  billion i think in terms of the aggressiveness of competition i dont think theres a fundamental difference in what weve seen and the ems business is a competitive business and again fundamentally i dont think theres a big shift that weve seen there as we look forward we do expect q to improve in terms of the quantity of wins led significantly by the healthcarelife sciences team they are expecting some decent wins this quarter the one thing that we did do this quarter is we did sign a letter of intent with a large industrial commercial customer however we have to win the individual business units so were not recognizing any of those wins until we win each of the business units so that will happen over the course of the fiscal  as we quote and win those pieces of business so from our viewpoint and as todd mentioned and you mentioned the funnel is healthy in front of the places where we want it to be in emea and in guad so yeah the number is down from where we would like to be or quite frankly where you want to see it go but fundamentally we dont see a big shift in the business in terms of what were doing in the business development front brian g alexander  raymond james  associates inc just a followup on that – on the industrial commercial letterofintent whats kind of the max opportunity there if you were to be successful on the individual pieces steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president we believe its north of  million in fact the customers called it as north of  million brian g alexander  raymond james  associates inc okay and then maybe for dean or todd im trying to get a sense for how much of the weakness that youre seeing in your business in general with the guidance for september being below expectations how much of this is really demanddriven versus more companyspecific and execution related when i look at the big dropoff in the communications business the process issue in the defense business the consistent kind of underperformance on overall margins versus your own internal goals and the several changes that youre making in leadership it would seem at least to us on the outside that maybe there is some deeper issues at plexus so can you talk about why that perception may not be warranted and whats really going on thanks dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah well we certainly dont want to leave you with that impression ill let todd address the first part of your question which relates to the dropoff in networkcommunications and we talked about a somewhat modest softness in sort of endmarket demand with some of the other sectors but fundamentally the leadership changes that weve been making have been in the longterm in the making and those that have followed plexus know that we decided to invest in the emea region a number of years ago in addition to the long legacy capability that we had in the uk that meant we had to begin to build out a team weve put a design center in europe we added a facility in oradea were able to attract a very talented leader away from one of our competitors to take the leadership over that region that individual ronnie darroch also is an extremely talented operations leader and he has as i said in my comments been pulling double duty leading emea and driving performance across the globe for manufacturing of course that was not a sustainable role having him do both so weve been developing oliver into a number of different positions he first led the engineering organization then we had him take on one of the market sectors to gain more understanding about manufacturing get closer to growth in those sectors and then were ready to ask him to take the assignment to lead the emea region and so that was at least probably a twoyear process to develop and ready him and free up ronnie then to focus on operations and of course i commented about mike who has been with the company for some time in various leadership roles so these things were really evolving as we look to grow in emea and as we look to get better execution and better standards in terms of the way we execute across the globe in manufacturing and those things of course are starting to pay some dividends in terms of our customer net promoter scores and as i talked about just extraordinary number of customer performance awards that we won this quarter so theres nothing – this isnt a reaction i would say this is more of a longerterm strategy in the development of our people and building the company to scale across the globe so ill turn it to todd and hell talk about the first part of your question todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure so with respect first of all brian to the networkingcommunications sector what i can say is that the sector as a whole is soft i mean were basically not seeing strong growth anywhere and the growth that were seeing is from new program wins now we do have a number of our top  customers where theres specific id call it exceptional softness or greater that are really driving the downturn in our fiscal q now as we look ahead to fiscal q we do expect some significant sequential growth within the sector in fiscal q brian g alexander  raymond james  associates inc okay thank you todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from mitch steves from rbc capital markets please go ahead mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc hey thanks guys i just had a quick question on the guadalajara facility ramps i remember i think last quarter you guys were talking about  basis points to  basis points improvement in q but now that i look at the slide deck it looks like you guys are delaying that to fy  so could you just maybe provide some commentary what changed there and why the delay patrick j jermain  senior vice president  chief financial officer sure so theres not a delay in guadalajara and its actually ahead of schedule so what we had talked about last quarter was overall a  basis point drag that was a result of the guadalajara investments that weve put in place to aggressively ramp the facility we expected to recover that over a three quarter period q q and q so weve recovered  basis points of it already in q because of the facility really ramping faster than expected achieving profitability when we expected it to be at a slight loss in q so were ahead of plan we still expect to make some further improvements in q and be completely up to corporate targets in q mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it thanks and then if i could ask one more on the networking side im sure you guys hear a lot of questions on this but is there any comments you guys can make on maybe next year just because the quarters were so lumpy this year and when well see maybe yearoveryear growth the comparable to be maybe pretty tough in the first two quarters dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer boy i dont know thats a tough one to answer right now because we sure didnt see the kind of step down like we just experienced into q i guess at this point i mean weve got a forecast for next year we see revenues coming up again in that sector as we come into the new fiscal year demand from the customers that we saw weaken has come back up we dont think that were going to see the extraordinary strength from in particular one of the customers that weve seen this past year and i dont think that they would suggest they would see that in that regard either in the near term definitely they were positioned such that they were first to market with a new technology and they made extraordinary progress penetrating that market and of course the demand is going to normalize now who knows whats going to happen with followon product technologies and those kinds of things but at this point that marketplace for us and for everyone i think is just really difficult to pin down in terms of what we think the kind of quarterbyquarter linearity is going to be its going to be – i think continue to be somewhat volatile here todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president the one thing too that id add dean is that were expecting strong growth and have a really solid forecast in our other three market sectors so we feel really good about our prospects in those three sectors but the networkingcommunications in general has been so volatile its just tough to predict right now mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it and just real quick was arris still a  customer in the quarter or did they drop off patrick j jermain  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah we mitch only report that on an annual basis so well be reporting that in our yearend results mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc okay got it thank you dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from matt sheerin from stifel please go ahead matt j sheerin  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes thanks good morning just wanted to ask some questions revolving around the production process constraints in your aerospacedefense business was that specific to one customer and could you give us more color in exactly what those issues were i know its been a drag on margins is it going to continue to be a drag over the next couple quarters todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure so matt this is todd ill take this one with respect to the issue of the production process constraint it was in our conformal coating function so this is essentially a backend process thats utilized heavily in aerospace occasionally in other market sectors but primarily within aerospace and whats particularly challenging around it is we have  chemistries that we currently have implemented right now of which three or four are the bulk of the volume and then within that conformal coating theres a certain – the typical method is to automate the processes around the coating but theres certain products that have very manual intensive processes that become very aero prone so what weve been working with our customers on is – and what we expected to have resolved within q is to automate some of these more manual processes on products in particular where weve seen upside and also to really bring on thirdparties for the really obscure coat processes that we have in place and those did not occur within the quarter were working through those and we have the bulk of it resolved as of today still a couple of things to resolve yet within the quarter but we expect to clear that up in the quarter well within the quarter even within the month and the impact is that wed recover that  basis point revenue impact that we had to operating margin as a result of not being able to get the product out late in the quarter dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would just add to that to be clear were pretty much ready to go unfortunately the nature of the aerospace technologies is such that it takes sometimes an extraordinary amount of time to get approvals to make production process changes and we thought we were going to get those things approved and be able to have a higher throughput and unfortunately that just didnt come about matt j sheerin  stifel nicolaus  co inc and was that an impact from one customer or multiple customers and was that revenue that you missed is that basically just pulled into the – or pushed out to the current quarter the september quarter dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer its from multiple customers and yes it is a push out matt j sheerin  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and just in terms of your  to  operating margin targets you talked about the moving parts and the drags from the three main issues what do you expect to reach those targets for all of fiscal  or at what point during fiscal  do you expect to hit those targets dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer im going to let pat take a little bit of a swing at this but at this point because of what happened with revenue obviously were clearly disappointed that we didnt live up to our commitments here because we really thought we were going to be on top of it here in this quarter so we have some work to do here in the coming year to make sure that we get the revenue the top line finetuned to get the cost structure right if we dont see some of these revenue come back to the extent that it was so i mean i would be disappointed if we couldnt get after this and see it earlier in the year i think we really need to do that otherwise its going to be a significant – its already a significant disappointment obviously to the shareholders and to us and so we feel a real sense of urgency to get the path back to get into that range patrick j jermain  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah id add to that matt that were right in the process of developing our plan for next year and looking out typically we always have a stepdown in our fiscal second quarter with merit increases and payroll resets but to deans point were looking at our cost structure and what we can do to get to those levels as soon as possible and whether we can get there for the full year we wouldnt be at a position right now to comment on it matt j sheerin  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thanks a lot dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from sherri scribner from deutsche bank please go ahead sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc hi thank you i wanted to dig a little bit more into the networking weakness that you saw this quarter and i want to confirm dean i think that you said during the previous questions that customers that were weak this quarter has come back i want to confirm that thats what you said and then also i wanted to ask in terms of the networking piece how much of that weakness do you believe is related to weakness in china which is something weve heard from other companies or is it not related to china at all dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer ill let someone else take the market question overall but i would just say i want to clarify what i said it came down late in q and disappointed and of course that weakness carried into q we see improvement in q but at this point not to the level that were executing revenues with some of the customers that came down for the prior higher levels i mean we see it coming back some but were not – i wouldnt say its a robust forecast for that sector steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president this is steve ill take the market question as todd highlighted in his comments we did see some extraordinary things happen with one or two customers with some new product ramps that came down and that kind of magnified the thing for us but in terms of the feedback were getting from customers yeah there is endmarket weakness that they are seeing that i think youve heard from other people so i think theres a combination of the two things one is we kind of have the extraordinary dip due to a couple of product lines and then just the overall general endmarket weakness is something that being reflected back to us as well todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president and its not necessarily china sherri steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president yeah sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc okay okay thanks and then dean just thinking about fiscal  you indicated that most of the segments are going to see growth next year based on your funnel of business and wins it looks like the street is forecasting growth of about  next year does that seem like a reasonable growth number for you for fiscal  dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer well its tough to start guiding  just yet but i mean certainly the marketplace supports growth at that or better and so i wouldnt want people to take their numbers up based on that statement yet because its just too early but if we only grow  that would be kind of disappointing quite frankly sherri a scribner  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from shawn harrison from longbow research please go ahead shawn m harrison  longbow research llc hi im going to beat a dead horse so we got a lot of detail on networking just want to be clear so were these new products going into market that didnt ramp as expected based upon the last comment was it an inventory correction was it new business you were supposed to ramp just trying to i guess get that last detail steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president this is steve the detail is is that the customer was forecasting stronger growth and strength in their product ramps and now it had been ramping nicely their endmarkets didnt materialize the way that they thought with those products in the quarter and they see a shortterm dip that was more significant than what i think anybody anticipated and i think dean highlighted the fact that we do expect to see some of that come back in  back to more normalized run rate so there was a particular product line that took a dip for everybody here more than what anybody anticipated and the exact endmarket reasons for that – i think weakness in what was happening in that market sector surprised everybody in that market sector or that subsector dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer well were also cautious here about what were saying quite frankly because were out in front of the customers on our customers earnings announcements as well so you know who some of our key customers are i guess id just say just hang on and listen to their calls and they will give you more detail we dont want to be giving information that are contrary to what they might say in terms of direction shawn m harrison  longbow research llc thats fair just the bounce back into the december quarter that implies that there is excess inventory out there and thats why we bounced back or is it stronger demand that youre getting from the customer in terms of the feedback dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah generally i dont think theres a lot of inventory in the channel this stuff is pretty much direct fulfilled so there is some of that clearly but a lot of this is just their ability to make sales to customers and get the product moving out into the marketplace shawn m harrison  longbow research llc okay and then just as a followup maybe i think it was todds earlier comments on a bullish year on mexico into  i know last quarter you talked about potentially very large programs breaking free is that what the bullishness in the medical sector is tied to or is there something else that could be breaking free in driving growth todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah so the growth is – we have three major customers that are ramping within that facility right now and id say that by itself is driving the bullish view but we also have several other healthcarelife sciences customers that were beginning to grow as well too and to be honest we would view that as being upside to our projections in mexico shawn m harrison  longbow research llc but nothing incremental on large medical programs breaking free tied to the comment last quarter todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president not into this facility at this point shawn m harrison  longbow research llc okay got you thanks so such operator thank you and our next question comes from steven fox from cross research please go ahead steven b fox  cross research llc thanks good morning first question just with regards to the weakness in networkingcommunications just a broader question the company has had periods where its disappointed the street and it seems to typically be related to customer or market concentration obviously you cant snap your fingers and just balance everything out overnight but can you talk about given this latest round of misses what youre doing to maybe reduce some of this endmarket risk or endmarket dependency risk in the future dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think if you look at where we were at a number of years ago in terms of our overall concentration in networkingcommunication obviously it was quite high i think it was  todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president  dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah it was north of  at one point in time so i think weve done a nice job not necessarily always in the way wed want to but weve done a nice job growing the other sectors proportionally faster than we have the networkingcommunication sector so thats part of the strategy part of the difficulty obviously with the customers in networkcommunications is they tend to have much bigger average program sizes than perhaps the other sectors so even though you have a lot of volatility in healthcare and you have volatility in industrialcommercial with individual product lines the fact that youre building so many different products with such a great deal of mix that tends to kind of smooth out performance but in networkcommunications the customers tend to have these very significant programs that can have enormous volatility to them so our strategy is to try to pick the right customers where we can provide a lot of valueadd grow in networkcommunications because we think its an important growth sector but continue to grow the other sectors faster to try to reduce some of that volatility but clearly were not always successful doing that like i would say the hit we took this – in the coming quarter obviously is driven substantially by networkcommunications but if we look at the miss in the prior quarter this was somewhat selfinflicted as well with our inability to get product out in defensesecurity and aerospace so its not all networkcommunications that gave us the current issues steven b fox  cross research llc yeah dean thats fair i guess one of the things i was getting at is my understanding was that you guys have done a better job of diversifying within the segment in networkingcommunications so maybe you can just sort of give us an update on how well youre diversified to – there are some – obviously with some industry consolidation that is going on theres some spending cycles that maybe are in more sync right now within that segment than usual but how diversified would you say you are today within that big segment thanks dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i dont have the percentages with me right now but clearly we have a couple of very dominant customers and like i said those customers – the revenue generated for plexus with those customers tends to revolve around a handful of product lines and so its going to be volatile in that sector for us so its not as stable as i think as wed like but at the same time these are great customers and great partners for us and of course were working to add additional customers into that sector to help grow with over a longer period of time and hopefully take some of that volatility out steven b fox  cross research llc great thank you very much dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from andrew huang from b riley please go ahead andrew huang  b riley  co llc thanks for taking my question first i was wondering if we could kind of go back a little bit to the wins and then specifically in the americas because i think in that specific geography there was a pretty big dropoff steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president todd do you want to take that dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah just go ahead steve steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president yeah so in the americas if you go back and look over the last couple of quarters its actually similar to some of the sectors theres actually been some volatility now a couple of quarters ago we had a pretty decent win i mean in q of f we were at  million q of f were at  million and this quarter were at  million so from a volatility standpoint i think what youll see as you look quartertoquarter you will see volatility in the regions just like you will in the sectors and thats why we kind of look at the trailing four quarters and the trailing four quarters has been running relatively flat in that  to  range so from our perspective its not anything thats abnormal its just normal volatility that we would see and as todd highlighted i think were pretty comfortable with what weve got sitting in the front end of each of the regions at the moment todd p kelsey  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah what id add too is from an absolute standpoint its the largest of the three regions even in the current quarter so its a number that we feel comfortable with andrew huang  b riley  co llc i think when you talked earlier you mentioned there was this large industrial customer going forward would that be in the americas region steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president no the benefit of that customer is that its a conglomerate that has several different business units and were actually quoting business in all three regions and thats one of the reasons why its a little bit more complex is that were going to quote each business unit for the right targeted market so from that standpoint we expect it to affect all three regions andrew huang  b riley  co llc okay and then my next question is related to your december quarter so i think historically with the exception of last year the industrialcommercial segment seems to take a pretty big downtick so at this point do you have any visibility on whether total company revenue for the december quarter will be up or down sequential dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer well yeah we would expect it to be up sequential id have to take a look at industrialcommercial youre right that it can show that sort of pattern but we also usually see healthcarelife sciences strengthen in that quarter because its the fiscal yearend for some of our bigger healthcare customers they tend to have a stronger performance in that quarter at the moment we probably suspect that there would be a little bit of softening and that sort of normal pattern would unfold andrew huang  b riley  co llc in industrialcommercial dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer industrialcommercial a little bit of softening but more strength in healthcare andrew huang  b riley  co llc okay if i could squeeze in just one housekeeping item i think for your fiscal  you actually cut your capex budget from  million down to  million so maybe you could talk a little bit about that patrick j jermain  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah we did andrew this is pat what will happen as we traditionally go through a year is weve got a forecast coming in and typically were not going to be able to get through all of the projects we prioritize those and well see some reduction as we go through the year so yes were down  million and just being more mindful about our capital given our circumstances and thats why going into next year we see a similar level andrew huang  b riley  co llc thanks very much dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from mark delaney from goldman sachs please go ahead mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions i was hoping first to talk more on the industrialcommercial segment and trying to better understand some of the dynamics with a couple of the larger program opportunities that the company has talked about i think on the last call the company talked about a  million opportunity and i think you had already booked  million or so of that with maybe another  million still to come how much of that has already shipped for revenue through the june quarter and how should we expect the additional part of that program to layer on and then the additional  million opportunity that you were talking about that you think you can book in industrial is that the same customer or is it somebody new and when can that turn into revenue steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president this is steve to answer your last question first the customer i talked about is a new customer its not the same one and in turn in regards to the customer we talked about last quarter the  million well complete ramping this quarter and it is fully loaded for the f forecast there we talked about additional  million in revenue in this quarter we closed  million of that additional so that will be being loaded into the site forecast in the f theres still an additional  million to  million thats in our funnel that were still pursuing with the customer and i dont have an expectation exactly as to when that would close but thats still in our funnel that were pursuing with that customer mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co and with the new  million opportunity that theres additional customer i mean is that revenue opportunity in  or is it more of a fiscal  timeframe before you can close the business and ship for sales steven j frisch  chief customer officer  executive vice president it would be a mix there is a piece of the business that were talking with the customer about doing transitions and so that would have an impact in  theres also opportunity that were talking with them about new program ramps which would probably not impact  and were still deciphering exactly what that mix is mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co okay understood and then just maybe more of a macroeconomic question about some of the trends the company is seeing across the businesses and certainly relates in particular to industrial a lot of semi and supply chain companies have seen weakness in the industrial endmarket i know theres actually a few bigger programs thats allowing plexus to do better in that business but maybe just help us understand have you seen any slowdown in some of your industrial programs outside of these big wins and if not is that something that concerns you as you look into fiscal  dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer well id just comment that i mean we are experiencing slowdowns with certain customers in certain endmarkets i mean weve certainly talked about the challenges in oil and gas and of course thats all already reflected in our numbers and our expectations semicap has kind of had fits and starts with – depending upon the customer we benefited some by just gaining incremental programs not so much because of the bullish endmarket demand by any stretch you saw we keep talking about healthcarelife sciences generally i would say its softer than we would expect and i think thats largely around the challenges of economic performance around the globe so it clearly is meeting the overall business growth for our customers and of course its reflected in our numbers so sometimes difficult economic times can actually benefit ems companies not because youre going to get the expansion of growth of existing product lines but the economic pressure that it puts on the broader customer base in various markets many times creates new opportunities that when become available had or maybe not become available as quickly without the economic pressures so we see this as just continuing the sort of secular trend toward global arts so its also seeing as long as this pressure continues mark t delaney  goldman sachs  co understood thank you very much dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from jim suva from citi please go ahead james d suva  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you when we think about your new business line is there a reason why one should not think about   dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks jim it sounds to us like you maybe on a mobile device or something because were having a little bit difficult time completely piecing together your questions so im going to try to interpolate between the various what i think i heard – i think you were asking about our  kind of enduring growth rate the target that we have of  of trailing four quarter revenues as being the target to support the  goal and excuse me if im not getting your question right but i think that throughout the year now for the past couple of years weve done a pretty good job staying meaningfully above that  goal if you look at this year i mean were all sitting here disappointed kind of how this has unfolded were still going to grow for the full year now it looks like just shy of that  enduring goal so the arithmetic in terms of our win rate and driving growth near  i think holds up and in fact all of our sectors are growing in fiscal  so i think we feel good about the growth its not – we felt we were going to be well above  the difficulty is that the cost structure was out in front of  – the cost structure was starting to come in for higher levels of growth and of course we also just have some couple of facilities here that are putting a meaningful drag on our nearterm results that we just have been frankly struggling to get them course corrected and we will get them course corrected but weve clearly struggled and so we havent gotten the operating leverage and the eps growth this year that we ought to be getting and so generally speaking i think that we still got the right model i think we still got the right gotomarket strategy were winning the new customers winning the programs this isnt – our issues arent related specifically to pricing in the marketplaces or in the industry of collapsing just our ability to generate profit is about us getting a couple of facilities course corrected and getting the growth into the new sites that weve invested in james d suva  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you very much dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you jim operator thank you and at this time im showing no further questions dean a foate  chairman president  chief executive officer all right well clearly this isnt the outcome that we had expected we expected just a quarter ago to have a much stronger result we take our responsibility and our commitments to deliver numbers in our guidance range very seriously over the past  years  years this is the only second time weve missed on our eps guidance range and were quite embarrassed by that and were even more disappointed here with what the outlook here in the nearterm on q and so again we appreciate the questions from the sellside and we certainly appreciate the support that weve had from our shareholders and we feel a sense of urgency to get the margin performance back where it needs to be and then get reacceleration of top line growth here as fiscal  unfolds so thanks very much and i hope all of you have a pleasant day operator thank you and thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference thank you for participating you may
