with the results of our wendy’s business which posted comparable store sales growth of almost  and grew comps  on a twoyear basis the topline sales momentum combined with favorable commodities and solid execution from our operators resulted in significant margin improvement and profit growth our pizza hut operations generated disappointing comparable store sales with a decline of  rolling over growth of  last year driven by the successful launch of the triple treat box despite the sales decline lower ingredient prices and favorable insurance adjustments related to improved loss trends served to maintain restaurant margins consistent with the prior year our pizza hut business has continued to struggle to consistently activate the consumer and drive the topline in an otherwise

we contemporize our restaurants to better meet the needs of today’s consumer and provide a best on block image we are pleased to have deleveraged our business by almost a half of a turn of leverage during fiscal  due to an increase of almost  in adjusted ebitda and the benefit of our accretive acquisition of  wendy’s units in raleigh north carolina in july  in addition we ended the year with ample liquidity which we will tap to fund our recently announced pending acquisition of  wendy’s restaurants in pennsylvania looking to  we remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue to

different periods and to compare our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s financial information reported under gaap adjusted ebitda as defined above may not be similar to ebitda measures of other companies  calculated as a percentage of net product sales  the company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures management believes that the free cash flow measure is important to investors to provide a measure of how much cash flow is available after current changes in working capital and acquisition of property and equipment to be used for working capital needs or for strategic opportunities including servicing debt making acquisitions and making investments in the business it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures   four most recent fiscal quarters ended   december   covenant ebitda nongaap
