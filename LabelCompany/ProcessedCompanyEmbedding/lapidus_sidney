will create curriculum to explore over  years of jewish life in america the american jewish experience historians agree began in  when sephardic jews arrived in what is now new york thanks to sidney lapidus ’ and his wife ruth students will be able to explore the interplay of cultures that has developed since then the new lapidus family fund for american jewish studies administered jointly by princeton’s programs in judaic studies and american studies will be used to develop new courses and invite speakers to campus among other curricular enhancements “we are grateful for this very thoughtful gift from the lapidus family whose generosity has already played an important role in enhancing the university’s scholarship in this area” said president shirley m tilghman “the american jewish community has shaped the life of our country in countless ways and i am delighted that princeton will now have an opportunity to explore this remarkable legacy in even greater depth” the fund will be used to craft interdisciplinary examinations of an array of topics such as religious and secular trends in american judaism relations among the africanamerican and jewish communities and other ethnicities and american yiddish culture lapidus a managing director and senior advisor of the manhattanbased private equity firm warburg pincus said the gift pairs two of his lifelong interests american studies and judaic studies “i want princeton students jewish and nonjewish to have the opportunity to learn about the enormous historical and cultural heritage and impact of jews in america” he said a history major as an undergraduate—as were his children gail lapidus dobosh ’ janet lapidus nova ’ and roy lapidus ’—lapidus is president of the american jewish historical society a member of the advisory council of princeton’s department of history and he sits with the judaic studies advisory council he is also a book collector with a particular interest in books and pamphlets relating to the american revolution the slave trade and judaica his gifts to princeton have included rare books pertaining to american jews in the th and th centuries and endowing the sidney and ruth lapidus professorship in the american revolutionary era “by bringing together in a formal way the work of the programs in judaic studies and american studies the lapidus family fund enlarges princeton’s commitment to innovation in the humanities and reinforces crucial areas of study hitherto addressed separately” said sean wilentz the george henry davis  professor of american history and director of

apartits important to understand what makes our fine jewelry department different so you can shop with confidence unlike fashion jewelry which is made from lowerquality materials like plastic and stainless steel fine jewelry is meant to last a lifetime it may incorporate some trendy design elements but ultimately fine jewelry is built to stand the test of time thanks to its use of highquality materials and expert construction this is what makes fine jewelry such a great choice for important gifts its an investment in quality that symbolizes love admiration respect or accomplishment with the use of symbolic precious metals and gemstones that signify value and longevity engagement rings are perhaps the most famous example of fine jewelry but there are many other types of jewelry pieces in this categorygemstonesmany fine jewelry pieces use gemstones like diamond cubic zirconia pearl ruby sapphire and emerald to add color and sparkle to rings earrings necklaces and bracelets some of walmarts fine jewelry items use simulated gemstones to offer a more affordable option for those who want to maintain the look and feel of fine jewelry on any budget these simulated gemstones have a similar appearance but have a different molecular structure from the genuine gemstone theyre designed to copy look for words like created or simulated as you shop our fine jewelry department to focus on faux gemstones for a beautiful alternative to the genuine articlemetalsstrong attractive metals like gold silver titanium and tungsten are commonly found in the fine jewelry department these metals are durable shiny and comfortable to wear and in the case of gold and silver theyve been used to make fine jewelry for centuries gold comes in different purity grades and colors and understanding the difference between these options will make it easiest to find the jewelry style you want gold is actually a very soft metal so pure gold also known as  karat k gold isnt the strongest type of gold available eighteen karat gold is a common purity grade used in fine jewelry it uses  percent gold with a few other metals mixed in to make it stronger and less prone to bending or scratching
