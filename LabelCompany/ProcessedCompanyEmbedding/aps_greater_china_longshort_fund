intimate knowledge of every stock in the portfolioaps’ investment philosophy is centered on investigative research rigorous valuation and constant testing of our own investment theses our investment philosophy and approach have remained unchanged since aps’ founding in investigative research beyond bottomupasian markets have traditionally been inefficient and they are best exploited by  experienced local investment professionals and  probing research we conduct onsite visits field investigations including interviews with former employees competitors suppliers industry specialists and other stakeholders and verification of information and data with independent sources the extensive granular body of knowledge we collect through this approach enables us to more effectively value a stock conduct due diligence and think independently of consensusrigorous valuationduring some market cycles investors tend to price securities irrationally and incorrectly thus tools such as economic forecasting and modelling cannot be used reliably to produce outperformance and reduce downside risk in the retaildominated asian markets instead portfolio risk can be mitigated by constructing a portfolio of alphadiversified strategies please see our explanation of alpha groups in the alpha groups  generation section  our focus is on each company’s intrinsic worth and whether the listed price reflects that worth the key to our success over the years is to buy at inexpensive valuations and to sell when a stock’s valuation becomes overstretched compared to its fundamentals sell disciplinewe adhere to a clear sell discipline and exit when  prices run ahead of fundamentals  initial assumptions are proven wrong  there are major changes in the fundamentals of either the industry or company redefining riskin our view there are risks greater than volatility such as overpaying for a security visàvis its fundamentals that is why we examine every stock insideout before making investment decisions—an intimate understanding of a company helps us to evaluate its behaviour under a variety of circumstances such as business and economic cycles political fluctuations regulatory changes structural events management changeovers among otherswe also focus on a relatively concentrated portfolio of highconviction stocks which allows us to initiate positions at reasonable valuations our portfolios are also managed with liquidity risk in mind only a small proportion of the portfolio is exposed to illiquid stocks from time to time and as appropriate in order to earn an illiquidity premium competitive advantages from aps’ investment approach our investment decisions are based on insights that can only be gained through a disciplined and rigorously applied process it goes beyond bottomup research  when the company’s internal or external circumstances evolve we have sufficient facts to test and validate our investment theses and make rational decisions without being influenced by market noise this knowledge gives us the conviction to stay invested when lessinformed investors irrationally run for the exit revise our investment theses as needed and set valuation targets   get in touch    csapscomsg investment philosophy investment process alpha groups quick links fund prices investor resources funds  strategies sitemap get in touch phone    email

news  events archive hedge fund interview with wong kok hoi founder chairman and cio of aps asset management pte ltd november   eurekahedge founded in  aps provides fund management services specialising in asia pacific equity investments aps is a fully independent firm owned  by its employees mr wong kok hoi founder chairman and cio of aps has more than  years of investment experience aps has three teams of  investment professionals based in singapore china and japan managing three key products ie asia exjapan greater china and japan equities as a bottomup fundamental manager aps prides itself on contrarian and creative thinking and original research and seeks to enhance its clients portfolios by superior stockpicking apss clients are mainly institutions that include pension funds foundations and family offices based in north america europe australianew zealand and asia earlier this year aps won a number of awards asia asset management named the aps china ashare fund best of the best awards china ashare  years aps also received accolades from hedge funds world for the aps asia pacifichedge fund best performing new fund recently the aps asiapacific hedge fund was the winner of fund of the year award in the asia including japan category by asiahedge awards  last year aps far east exjapan product was ranked best fund for past one and two years based on mercer investment consulting survey for far east exjapan equity funds ending december  the performance and aum of the funds are as follows fund name assets as of oct ytd net returns as of oct year net returns as of oct aps asiapacific hedge fund us million   aps greater china longshort fund us million   aps far east alpha fund us million   aps japan alpha fund us million   aps small cap alpha fund us million   aps china ashare fund us million   in  many funds have struggled in volatile unpredictable and nontrending markets your funds on the other hand have performed admirably how did you deliver this performance many funds are trendfollowing and where the trends are volatile and unpredictable following them can lead to volatile and unpredictable investment returns at aps we have a very different approach we do not follow trends especially shortterm trends we look for value and attractive businesses when we find them we do our due diligence to confirm that our investment hypothesis is correct and then we invest for the longterm the turnover on our longonly funds typically is between  and  so we are not traders when you focus on the longterm prospects of a business you can generate attractive riskadjusted returns for your investors one of the themes this year has been the weakening us dollar were you able to capture the opportunities presented assuming that this trend continues how do you intend to capitalise on it going forward if asian economies were still dependent on exports to the developed markets where there is a high degree of substitution the weakening dollar would have presented a greater problem  the fact is that asia companies now produce many goods and services that other countries do not whether it is a lowcost apparel made in sri lanka or iphones and ipads in china  moreover the largest economy in the region china effectively has pegged its currency to the us dollar so its weakening has if anything strengthened chinas positioning as a global lowcost exporter what have you done differently in the postlehman world to meet investor expectations in terms of performance have you changed your investing approachstrategies we have not changed our investing approach or strategies in the last  years we have done extremely well in the last three years our asiapacific hedge fund is up  in the last three years because we hedged well in  we like to believe that we stay disciplined to our investment process at all times and are not easily carried away by market euphoria or pessimism also we already have robust risk controls but early this year we strengthened them by adding realtime risk analysis systems for the portfolios these systems help us to understand how the portfolios are positioned and what is helping and hurting in real time of the different strategies employed by aps asset management which has been the best performing over the years and why what competitive edge do you offer investors investing in your funds our investment strategies are consistent across all our products but our hedge funds particularly the aps asiapacific hedge fund have performed very well in this tough directionless environment the markets in asia remain inefficient and these allow us to identify and invest in undervalued companies on the long side and short overvalued companies on the short side our competitive edge we believe is our experience and our expertise in deep and thorough primary research we have done just this in aps for  years and feel that we have become quite good at it last year our aps asiapacific hedge fund was up  and this year in what has been an even more challenging environment it was up  as of endoctober  what sort of fundamentaltechnical analyses would you put into your prestock selection research could you tell us a little about your investment philosophy how do you drive synergy across the different funds our stock selection process is purely fundamentally driven we do not use technical analysis  our core investment beliefs are that economic modelling in asia is not reliable for reducing risk or generating excess returns and that securities can be mispriced by an irrational and volatile fastmoving market we believe that we must invest independently from the market to generate strong alpha and as such we place importance on independence of ideas and thoughts and inhouse idea generation by our investment professionals the empirical evidence is that consensus underperforms our analysts and portfolio managers source ideas from four main areas structural and business trends new companies and products outoffavour stocks and companyspecific leads once we have identified an investment idea it is then classified into what we call alpha categories structural economic dynamic and opportunistic alpha then we conduct our due diligence and valuation work before a final investment decision is made by a portfolio manager this results in a diversified alpha portfolio we share ideas across different teams we are blessed by a team of investment professionals that we built over the years during the most challenging times in  we retained all of our staff and hence were able to seize the opportunities during the bear and bull markets in the last three years could you give us an overview of your risk management practices across the different funds  any changes over the last two years we have an independent risk analytics team led by our chief operations officer coo which monitors portfolio risk at the individual stock and portfolio level we utilise proprietary live portfolio analytics which look at liquidity risk and concentration risk among other variables we prepare performance attribution analysis to view our largest contributors and largest detractors we also have oversight by an independent compliance team to monitor trades and portfolio positions against investment guidelines and our portfolio guidelines are built into a frontend compliance system where trades are cleared before execution how has asset raising environment been in   any new launches or strategies to deal with the changed financial landscape our strong performance over the past three years has generated a great deal of interest in our funds particularly the aps asiapacific hedge fund and the aps china ashare fund as a result we have seen an increase in our assets under management in both funds we secured an investment in the aps asiapacific hedge fund from one large pension fund in the us and we won our first asian mandate from an australian superannuation pension fund based on the level of interest we have seen here in asia and in the us and europe we believe  should see even more assets flow into our funds in terms of new launches we launched the aps greater china alpha fund in october  managed by the same team which manages aps china ashare fund which entered a soft close also our openended vietnam alpha fund will be launched in the second quarter of  to investors seeking to invest in one of the last frontier equities markets in the region what do you have to do differently in the postlehman environment to raise capital postlehman investors have higher demands for transparency and rigorous attention to investment guidelines risk controls and compliance in order to attract assets i think we will have to demonstrate to investors that we have got skillsets that can generate longterm alphas and you will also have to articulate it well not in a fuzzy or blackbox language manner  you also need to have a full infrastructure which we do in fact aps looks better as a result of higher investor demands  quite an irony how do you foresee the amount of stress laid on tightening regulations across the hedge fund industry to affect your fund are there any requirements that could potentially inhibit you funds strategies if anything the tightening regulations are good for our hedge funds our hedge funds are not that large with the aps asiapacific hedge fund just over us million typically the size which can generate the strongest returns to investors as a firm however aps has us billion aum so our hedge funds small as they are are operating within a larger organisational structure investors can get the best of both worlds  access to a smaller and strong performing hedge fund within a larger firm structure which reduces operational risks could you share with us your shortterm and mediumterm outlook on some of the regional markets  we remain bullish on the equities markets in asia in china we believe the longterm growth story remains intact and valuations remain attractive china trades at about x per but offers superior growth prospects asia too is attractive asian economies are increasingly less dependent on western economies which is a positive given the sluggish economic environment there intraasian trade is rising and there is a greater importance within asia of economies less sensitive to us for instance china india and indonesia comprise roughly  of asias gdp according to the imf and are among those economies least sensitive to us growth southeast asia also sees positive demographic trends the population of  million is young with over  less than  years old like china countries such as malaysia thailand philippines and india are entering a stage of economic development when rising gdp per capita leads to increases in domestic consumption finally equity valuations are attractive in asia with most countries trading below a per to growth peg ratio of less than one contact details
