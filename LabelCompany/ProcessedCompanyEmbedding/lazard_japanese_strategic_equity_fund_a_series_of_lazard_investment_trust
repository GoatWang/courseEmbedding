the value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount you invested fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the funds base currency the currency of the funds investments your share class and the currency of the country in which you live may have the effect of causing the value of your investment to diminish or increase the securities markets may be less developed in emerging markets and there is a greater risk that the fund may experience delays in buying selling and claiming ownership of its investments emerging markets may also have less developed political economic and legal systems and there is a higher risk that the fund may not get back its money back investment in lower rated bonds increases the risk of default on repayment and the risk to capital of the fund the value of bonds tend to decrease when interest rates andor inflation rises more than  of the fund may be invested in fixed interest securities issued by a single government if they can’t repay the amount borrowed the value of your investment will fall the fund invests in financial derivative instruments “fdi’s” for the purposes of both reducing exposure hedging and also to gain greater exposure to underlying investments the use of fdi’s to gain greater exposure to underlying investments than by a direct investment increases the possibility for profit but also increases the risk of loss the fund is subject to the risk of the insolvency or default of its counterparties to fdi investments in such events the funds may have limited recourse
