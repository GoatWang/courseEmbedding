advised madeleine albright during the genocide in rwanda to request the un to withdraw all un troops from rwanda she refused but permitted general dallaire to keep a few hundred troops who managed to save thousands from the genocide later clarke told samantha power “it wasn’t in american’s national interest if we had to do the same thing today and i was advising the president i would advise the same thing he directed the authoring of pdd which outlined a reduced military and economic role for the united states in rwanda as well as future peacekeeping operations islamists took control in sudan in a  coup détat and the united states adopted a policy of disengagement with the authoritarian regime throughout the s after the september   terrorist attacks however some critics charged that the us should have moderated its policy toward sudan earlier since the influence of islamists there waned in the second half of the s and sudanese officials began to indicate an interest in accommodating us concerns with respect to  mastermind osama bin laden who had been living in sudan until he was expelled in may  timothy m carney us ambassador to sudan between september  and november  coauthored an oped in  claiming that in  sudan offered to turn over its intelligence on bin laden but that susan rice as nsc africa specialist together with the then nsc terrorism specialist richard a clarke successfully lobbied for continuing to bar us officials including the cia and fbi from engaging with the khartoum government similar allegations that susan rice joined others in missing an opportunity to cooperate with sudan on counterterrorism were made by vanity fair contributing editor david rose and richard miniter author of losing bin laden clarke was also involved in investigating ramzi yousef one of the main perpetrators of the  world trade center bombing who traveled to the united states on an iraqi passport yousef is the nephew of khalid sheikh mohammed a senior alqaeda member many in the clinton administration and the intelligence community believed this was evidence linking alqaedas activities and the government of iraq in february  clarke wrote the deputy national security advisor that one reliable source reported iraqi officials had met with bin ladin and may have offered him asylum therefore clarke advised against surveillance flights to track bin laden in afghanistan anticipating an attack “old wily usama will likely boogie to baghdad” where he would be impossible to find clarke also made statements that year to the press linking iraqi nerve gas experts and alqaeda to an alleged jointchemicalweaponsdevelopment effort at the al shifa pharmaceutical plant in sudan michael scheuer is the former chief of the bin laden unit at the counterterrorist center at the cia matthew continetti writes scheuer believes that clarke’s risk aversion and politicking negatively impacted the hunt for bin laden prior to september   scheuer stated that his unit codename alec had provided information that could have led to the capture and or killing of osama bin laden on ten different occasions during the clinton administration only to have his recommendations for action turned down by senior intelligence officials including clarke bush administrationedit clarke and his communications with the bush administration regarding bin laden and associated terrorist plots targeting the united states were mentioned frequently in condoleezza rices public interview by the  investigatory commission on april   of particular significance was a memo from january   that clarke had authored and sent to condoleezza rice along with making an urgent request for a meeting of the national security councils principals committee to discuss the growing alqaeda threat in the greater middle east the memo also suggests strategies for combating alqaeda that might be adopted by the new bush administration in his memoir against all enemies clarke wrote that condoleezza rice made a decision that the position of national coordinator for counterterrorism should be downgraded by demoting the office the administration sent a signal through the national security bureaucracy about the salience they assigned to terrorism no longer would clarkes memos go to the president instead they had to pass through a chain of command of national security advisor condoleezza rice and her deputy stephen hadley who bounced every one of them back within a week of the inauguration i wrote to rice and hadley asking urgently for a principals or cabinetlevel meeting to review the imminent alqaeda threat rice told me that the principals committee which had been the first venue for terrorism policy discussions in the clinton administration would not address the issue until it had been framed by the deputies the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states reported in its eighth public hearing clarke asked on several occasions for early principals meetings on these issues and was frustrated that no early meeting was scheduled no principals committee meetings on al qaeda were held until september th  at the first deputies committee meeting on terrorism held in april  clarke strongly suggested that the us put pressure on both the taliban and alqaeda by arming the northern alliance and other groups in afghanistan simultaneously that they target bin laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the mq predators to which deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz responded well i just dont understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin laden clarke replied that he was talking about bin laden and his network because it posed an immediate and serious threat to the united states according to clarke

denigrated by himself and mr tenet on march   at the height of the controversy during the  commission hearings clarke went on nbcs sunday morning news show meet the press and was interviewed by

fellow officials who seemed to want to use the excuse of being traumatized and caught unaware by alqaedas attacks on the usa because their being caught unaware was due to their ignoring clear reports a major attack on us soil was imminent clarke particularly singled out former vice president dick cheney and former secretary of state condoleezza rice in april  clarke released his book on cyber war in april  clarke wrote a new york times oped addressing cyber attacks in stemming cyber attacks carried out by foreign governments and foreign hackers particularly from china clarke opined that the us government should be authorized to create a major program to grab stolen data leaving the country in a fashion similar to how the us department of homeland security currently searches for child pornography that crosses americas virtual borders moreover he suggested that the us president could authorize agencies to scan internet traffic outside the us and seize sensitive files stolen from within the united states clarke then stated that such a policy would not endanger privacy rights through the institution of a privacy advocate who could stop abuses or any activity that went beyond halting the theft of important files the oped did not offer evidence that finding and blocking files while they are being transmitted is technically feasible in september  clarke stated that middle eastern governments were likely behind hacking incidents against several banks during the same year he also endorsed barack obamas reelection for president of the united states following the  highspeed fatal car crash of journalist michael hastings a vocal critic of the surveillance state and restrictions on the press freedom under the obama administration tenure clarke was quoted as saying there is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers—including the united states—know how to remotely seize control of a car so if there were a cyber attack on the car—and im not saying there was i think whoever did it would probably get away with it in  clarke served on an advisory group for the obama administration as it sought to reform nsa spying programs following the revelations of documents released by edward snowden the report mentioned in recommendation  on page  that the national security council staff should manage an interagency process to review on a

save thousands from the genocide later clarke told samantha power “it wasn’t in american’s national interest if we had to do the same thing today and i was advising the president i would advise the same thing he directed the authoring of pdd which outlined a reduced military and economic role for the united states in rwanda as well as future peacekeeping operations islamists took control in sudan in a  coup détat and the united states adopted a policy of disengagement with the authoritarian regime throughout the s after the september   terrorist attacks however some critics charged that the us should have moderated its policy toward sudan earlier since the influence of islamists there waned in the second half of the s and sudanese officials began to indicate an interest in accommodating us concerns with respect to  mastermind osama bin laden who had been living in sudan until he was expelled in may  timothy m carney us ambassador to sudan between september  and november  coauthored an oped in  claiming that in  sudan offered to turn over its intelligence on bin laden but that susan rice as nsc africa specialist together with the then nsc terrorism specialist richard a clarke successfully lobbied for continuing to bar us officials including the cia and fbi from engaging with the khartoum government similar allegations that susan rice joined others in missing an opportunity to cooperate with sudan on counterterrorism were made by vanity fair contributing editor david rose and richard miniter author of losing bin laden clarke was also involved in investigating ramzi yousef one of the main perpetrators of the  world trade center bombing who traveled to the united states on an iraqi passport yousef is the nephew of khalid sheikh mohammed a senior alqaeda member many in the clinton administration and the intelligence community believed this was evidence linking alqaedas activities and the government of iraq in february  clarke wrote the deputy national security advisor that one reliable source reported iraqi officials had met with bin ladin and may have offered him asylum therefore clarke advised against surveillance flights to track bin laden in afghanistan anticipating an attack “old wily usama will likely boogie to baghdad” where he would be impossible to find clarke also made statements that year to the press linking iraqi nerve gas experts and alqaeda to an alleged jointchemicalweaponsdevelopment effort at the al shifa pharmaceutical plant in sudan michael scheuer is the former chief of the bin laden unit at the counterterrorist center at the cia matthew continetti writes scheuer believes that clarke’s risk aversion and politicking negatively impacted the hunt for bin laden prior to september   scheuer stated that his unit codename alec had provided information that could have led to the capture and or killing of osama bin laden on ten different occasions during the clinton administration only to have his recommendations for action turned down by senior intelligence officials including clarke bush administrationedit clarke and his communications with the bush administration regarding bin laden and associated terrorist plots targeting the united states were mentioned frequently in condoleezza rices public interview by the  investigatory commission on april   of particular significance was a memo from january   that clarke had authored and sent to condoleezza rice along with making an urgent request for a meeting of the national security councils principals committee to discuss the growing alqaeda threat in the greater middle east the memo also suggests strategies for combating alqaeda that might be adopted by the new bush administration in his memoir against all enemies clarke wrote that condoleezza rice made a decision that the position of national coordinator for counterterrorism should be downgraded by demoting the office the administration sent a signal through the national security bureaucracy about the salience they assigned to terrorism no longer would clarkes memos go to the president instead they had to pass through a chain of command of national security advisor condoleezza rice and her deputy stephen hadley who bounced every one of them back within a week of the inauguration i wrote to rice and hadley asking urgently for a principals or cabinetlevel meeting to review the imminent alqaeda threat rice told me that the principals committee which had been the first venue for terrorism policy discussions in the clinton administration would not address the issue until it had been framed by the deputies the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states reported in its eighth public hearing clarke asked on several occasions for early principals meetings on these issues and was frustrated that no early meeting was scheduled no principals committee meetings on al qaeda were held until september th  at the first deputies committee meeting on terrorism held in april  clarke strongly suggested that the us put pressure on both the taliban and alqaeda by arming the northern alliance and other groups in afghanistan simultaneously that they target bin laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the mq predators to which deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz responded well i just dont understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin laden clarke replied that he was talking about bin laden and his network because it posed an immediate and serious threat to the united states according to clarke wolfowitz turned to him and said you give bin laden too much credit he could not do all these things like the  attack on new york not without a state sponsor just because fbi and cia have failed to

security group – united states department of state  assistant secretary of state for politicomilitary affairs – deputy assistant secretary of state for intelligence – clinton administrationedit clarke advised madeleine albright during the genocide in rwanda to request the un to withdraw all un troops from rwanda she refused but permitted general dallaire to keep a few hundred troops who managed to save thousands from the genocide later clarke told samantha power “it wasn’t in american’s national interest if we had to do the same thing today and i was advising the president i would advise the same thing he directed the authoring of pdd which outlined a reduced military and economic role for the united states in rwanda as well as future peacekeeping operations islamists took control in sudan in a  coup détat and the united states adopted a policy of disengagement with the authoritarian regime throughout the s after the september   terrorist attacks however some critics charged that the us should have moderated its policy toward sudan earlier since the influence of islamists there waned in the second half of the s and sudanese officials began to indicate an interest in accommodating us concerns with respect to  mastermind osama bin laden who had been living in sudan until he was expelled in may  timothy m carney us ambassador to sudan between september  and november  coauthored an oped in  claiming that in  sudan offered to turn over its intelligence on bin laden but that susan rice as nsc africa specialist together with the then nsc terrorism specialist richard a clarke successfully lobbied for continuing to bar us officials including the cia and fbi from engaging with the khartoum government similar allegations that susan rice joined others in missing an opportunity to cooperate with sudan on counterterrorism were made by vanity fair contributing editor david rose and richard miniter author of losing bin laden clarke was also involved in investigating ramzi yousef one of the main perpetrators of the  world trade center bombing who traveled to the united states on an iraqi passport yousef is the nephew of khalid sheikh mohammed a senior alqaeda member many in the clinton administration and the intelligence community believed this was evidence linking alqaedas activities and the government of iraq in february  clarke wrote the deputy national security advisor that one reliable source reported iraqi officials had met with bin ladin and may have offered him asylum therefore clarke advised against surveillance flights to track bin laden in afghanistan anticipating an attack “old wily usama will likely boogie to baghdad” where he would be impossible to find clarke also made statements that year to the press linking iraqi nerve gas experts and alqaeda to an alleged jointchemicalweaponsdevelopment effort at the al shifa pharmaceutical plant in sudan michael scheuer is the former chief of the bin laden unit at the counterterrorist center at the cia matthew continetti writes scheuer believes that clarke’s risk aversion and politicking negatively impacted the hunt for bin laden prior to september   scheuer stated that his unit codename alec had provided information that could have led to the capture and or killing of osama bin laden on ten different occasions during the clinton administration only to have his recommendations for action turned down by senior intelligence officials including clarke bush administrationedit clarke and his communications with the bush administration regarding bin laden and associated terrorist plots targeting the united states were mentioned frequently in condoleezza rices public interview by the  investigatory commission on april   of particular significance was a memo from january   that clarke had authored and sent to condoleezza rice along with making an urgent request for a meeting of the national security councils principals committee to discuss the growing alqaeda threat in the greater middle east the memo also suggests strategies for combating alqaeda that might be adopted by the new bush administration in his memoir against all enemies clarke wrote that condoleezza rice made a decision that the position of national coordinator for counterterrorism should be downgraded by demoting the office the administration sent a signal through the national security bureaucracy about the salience they assigned to terrorism no longer would clarkes memos go to the president instead they had to pass through a chain of command of national security advisor condoleezza rice and her deputy stephen hadley who bounced every one of them back within a week of the inauguration i wrote to rice and hadley asking urgently for a principals or cabinetlevel meeting to review the imminent alqaeda threat rice told me that the principals committee which had been the first venue for terrorism policy discussions in the clinton administration would not address the issue until it had been framed by the deputies the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states reported in its eighth public hearing clarke asked on several occasions for early principals meetings on these issues and was frustrated that no early meeting was scheduled no principals committee meetings on al qaeda were held until september th  at the first deputies committee meeting on terrorism held in april  clarke strongly suggested that the us put pressure on both the taliban and alqaeda by arming the northern alliance and other groups in afghanistan simultaneously that they target bin laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the mq predators to which deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz responded well i just dont understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin laden clarke replied that he was talking about bin laden and his network because it posed an immediate and serious threat to the united states according to clarke wolfowitz turned to him and said you give bin laden too much credit he could not do all these things like the  attack on new york not without a state sponsor just because fbi and cia have failed to find the linkages does not mean they dont exist clarke wrote in against all enemies that in the summer of  the intelligence community was convinced of an imminent attack by al qaeda but could not get the attention of the highest levels of the bush administration most famously writing that director of the central intelligence agency george tenet was running around with his hair on fire at a july   white house gathering of the faa the coast guard the fbi secret service and ins clarke stated that something really spectacular is going to happen here and its going to happen soon  cyberterrorism and cybersecurityedit clarke as special advisor to the president on cybersecurity spent his last year in the bush administration focusing on cybersecurity and the threat of terrorism against the critical infrastructure of the united states at a security conference in  after citing statistics that indicate that less than  percent of corporate revenue on average is spent on informationtechnology security clarke was famously heard to say if you spend more on coffee than on it security then you will be hacked whats more you deserve to be hacked in june  clarke discussed issues of cybersecurity in depth in an interview on the colbert report in which he was seemingly misled into thinking that they were discussing cybersecurity threats from the chinese through the use of mobile devices such as ipads instead stephen colbert was doing a humorous piece on the threats of orangutans learning to use ipads indeed when confronted on the issue directly clarke himself clarified that he was not discussing nonhuman primate based cyberterrorism threats orangutans you mean like apes said clarke are you shtin me im talking about the chinese  commissionedit on march   clarke testified at the public  commission hearings at the outset of his testimony clarke offered an apology to the families of  victims and an acknowledgment that the government had failed i also welcome the hearings because it is finally a forum where i can apologize to the loved ones of the victims of to the loved ones of the victims of  to them who are here in this room to those who are watching on television your government failed you those entrusted with protecting you failed you and i failed you we tried hard but that doesnt matter because we failed and for that failure i would ask once all the facts are out for your understanding and for your forgiveness many of the events clarke recounted during the hearings were also published in his memoir clarke charged that before and during the  crisis many in the administration were distracted from efforts against osama bin ladens alqaeda organization by a preoccupation with iraq and saddam hussein clarke had written that on september   president bush pulled him and a couple of aides aside and testily asked him to try to find evidence that saddam was connected to the terrorist attacks in response he wrote a report stating there was no evidence of iraqi involvement and got it signed by all relevant agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and the cia the paper was quickly returned by a deputy with a note saying please update and resubmit after initially denying that such a meeting between the president and clarke took place the white house later reversed its denial when others present backed clarkes version of the events supporting clarkes claim that in the months leading up to  what should have been considered an alarming amount of intelligence forewarning of attacks was delivered to the president former deputy attorney general jamie gorelick the sole member of the  commission permitted under an agreement with the bush adminstration to read the presidents daily brief reported in the hearings that information in the documents would set your hair on fire though barred by secrecy rules from disclosing much of the details contained in the documents she reported that they contained an extraordinary spike in intelligence warnings of alqaida attacks that had plateaued at a spike level for months before  criticismedit this sections tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on wikipedia see wikipedias guide to writing better articles for suggestions october  learn how and when to remove this template message before and after clarke appeared before the  commission some critics tried to attack his credibility launching a fullscale offensive against him impugning his personal motives claiming he was a disappointed jobhunter that he sought publicity and that he was a political partisan they charged that he exaggerated perceived failures in the bush administrations counterterrorism policies while exculpating the former clinton administration from its perceived shortcomings according to some reports the white house tried to discredit clarke in a move described as shooting the messenger new york times economics columnist paul krugman was more blunt calling the attacks on clarke a campaign of character assassination some republicans inside and outside the bush administration questioned both clarkes testimony and his tenure during the hearings senate republican majority leader bill frist took to the senate floor to make a speech alleging clarke told two entirely different stories under oath pointing to congressional hearing testimony clarke gave in  and his  commission testimony frist later speculated to reporters clarke was trading on his former service as a government insider with access to the nation’s most valuable intelligence to sell a book during clarkes earlier testimony he stated that bill clinton did not have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism during later testimony he stated that president clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism as summarized by the toledo blade in his august  briefing mr clarke told reporters  that the clinton administration had no overall plan on alqaeda to pass on to the bush administration  that just days after his inauguration mr bush said he wanted a new more comprehensive antiterror strategy  that mr bush ordered implementation of antiterror measures that had been kicking around since  and  that before sept  mr bush had increased fivefold the funding for cia covert action programs against alqaeda  its reasonable enough to argue that mr bush could have done more to guard against terror though it isnt clear what what is incredible is to argue—as mr clarke did before the  commission—that president clinton was more concerned about alqaeda than mr bush was  clarke was criticized for his suggestions in  of intelligence indicating a link between saddam hussein and alqaeda despite the fact clarke and others concluded after investigations by  that no link had been established in against all enemies he writes it is certainly possible that iraqi agents dangled the possibility of asylum in iraq before bin laden at some point when everyone knew that the us was pressuring the taliban to arrest him if that dangle happened bin ladens accepting asylum clearly did not p  in an interview on march   clarke claimed that theres absolutely no evidence that iraq was supporting alqaeda ever clarke claimed in his book that this conclusion was understood by the intelligence community at the time of  and the ensuing months but top bush administration officials were preoccupied with finding a link between iraq and  in the months that followed the attack and thus clarke argued the iraq war distracted attention and resources from the war in afghanistan and hunt for osama bin laden fox news allegedly with the administrations consent identified and released a background briefing that clarke gave in august  at the administrations request to minimize the fallout from a time magazine story about the presidents failure to take certain actions before  in that briefing on behalf of the white house clarke stated there was no plan on alqaeda that was passed from the clinton administration to the bush administration and that after taking office president bush decided to add to the existing clinton strategy and to increase cia resources for example for covert action fivefold to go after alqaeda at the next days hearing  commission member james thompson challenged clarke with the  account and clarke explained i was asked to make that case to the press i was a special assistant to the president and i made the case i was asked to make i was asked to highlight the positive aspects of what the administration had done and to minimize the negative aspects of what the administration had done and as a special assistant to the president one is frequently asked to do that kind of thing ive done it for several presidents another point of attack was clarkes role in allowing members of the bin laden family to fly to saudi arabia on september   according to clarkes statements to the  commission a request was relayed to clarke from the saudi embassy to allow the members of the bin laden family living in the us to fly home clarke testified to the commission that he passed this decision in turn to the fbi via dale watson and that the fbi at length sent its approval of the flight to the interagency crisis management group however fbi spokesman john iannarelli denied that the fbi had a role in approving the flight i can say unequivocally that the fbi had no role in facilitating these flights clarke has also exchanged criticism with michael scheuer former chief of the bin laden issue station at the cia when asked to respond to clarkes claim that scheuer was a hothead a middle manager who really didnt go to any of the cabinet meetings scheuer returned the criticism as follows i certainly agree with the fact that i didnt go to the cabinet meetings but im certainly also aware that im much better informed than mr clarke ever was about the nature of the intelligence that was available against osama bin laden and which was consistently

opportunity to cooperate with sudan on counterterrorism were made by vanity fair contributing editor david rose and richard miniter author of losing bin laden clarke was also involved in investigating ramzi yousef one of the main perpetrators of the  world trade center bombing who traveled to the united states on an iraqi passport yousef is the nephew of khalid sheikh mohammed a senior alqaeda member many in the clinton administration and the intelligence community believed this was evidence linking alqaedas activities and the government of iraq in february  clarke wrote the deputy national security advisor that one reliable source reported iraqi officials had met with bin ladin and may have offered him asylum therefore clarke advised against surveillance flights to track bin laden in afghanistan anticipating an attack “old wily usama will likely boogie to baghdad” where he would be impossible to find clarke also made statements that year to the press linking iraqi nerve gas experts and alqaeda to an alleged jointchemicalweaponsdevelopment effort at the al shifa pharmaceutical plant in sudan michael scheuer is the former chief of the bin laden unit at the counterterrorist center at the cia matthew continetti writes scheuer believes that clarke’s risk aversion and politicking negatively impacted the hunt for bin laden prior to september   scheuer stated that his unit codename alec had provided information that could have led to the capture and or killing of osama bin laden on ten different occasions during the clinton administration only to have his recommendations for action turned down by senior intelligence officials including clarke bush administrationedit clarke and his communications with the bush administration regarding bin laden and associated terrorist plots targeting the united states were mentioned frequently in condoleezza rices public interview by the  investigatory commission on april   of particular significance was a memo from january   that clarke had authored and sent to condoleezza rice along with making an urgent request for a meeting of the national security councils principals committee to discuss the growing alqaeda threat in the greater middle east the memo also suggests strategies for combating alqaeda that might be adopted by the new bush administration in his memoir against all enemies clarke wrote that condoleezza rice made a decision that the position of national coordinator for counterterrorism should be downgraded by demoting the office the administration sent a signal through the national security bureaucracy about the salience they assigned to terrorism no longer would clarkes memos go to the president instead they had to pass through a chain of command of national security advisor condoleezza rice and her deputy stephen hadley who bounced every one of them back within a week of the inauguration i wrote to rice and hadley asking urgently for a principals or cabinetlevel meeting to review the imminent alqaeda threat rice told me that the principals committee which had been the first venue for terrorism policy discussions in the clinton administration would not address the issue until it had been framed by the deputies the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states reported in its eighth public hearing clarke asked on several occasions for early principals meetings on these issues and was frustrated that no early meeting was scheduled no principals committee meetings on al qaeda were held until september th  at the first deputies committee meeting on terrorism held in april  clarke strongly suggested that the us put pressure on both the taliban and alqaeda by arming the northern alliance and other groups in afghanistan simultaneously that they target bin laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the mq predators to which deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz responded well i just dont understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin laden clarke replied that he was talking about bin laden and his network because it posed an immediate and serious threat to the united states according to clarke wolfowitz turned to him and said you give bin laden too much credit he could not do all these things like the  attack on new york not without a state sponsor just because fbi and cia have failed to find the linkages does not mean they dont exist clarke wrote in against all enemies that in the summer of  the intelligence community was convinced of an imminent attack by al qaeda but could not get the attention of the highest levels of the bush administration most famously writing that director of the central intelligence agency george tenet was running around with his hair on fire at a july   white house gathering of the faa the coast guard the fbi secret service and ins clarke stated that something really spectacular is going to happen here and its going to happen soon  cyberterrorism and cybersecurityedit clarke as special advisor to the president on cybersecurity spent his last year in the bush administration focusing on cybersecurity and the threat of terrorism against the critical infrastructure of the united states at a security conference in  after citing statistics that indicate that less than  percent of corporate revenue on average is spent on informationtechnology security clarke was famously heard to say if you spend more on coffee than on it security then you will be hacked whats more you deserve to be hacked in june  clarke discussed issues of cybersecurity in depth in an interview on the colbert report in which he was seemingly misled into thinking that they were discussing cybersecurity threats from the chinese through the use of mobile devices such as ipads instead stephen colbert was doing a humorous piece on the threats of orangutans learning to use ipads indeed when confronted on the issue directly clarke himself clarified that he was not discussing nonhuman primate based cyberterrorism threats orangutans you mean like apes said clarke are you shtin me im talking about the chinese  commissionedit on march   clarke testified at the public  commission hearings at the outset of his testimony clarke offered an apology to the families of  victims and an acknowledgment that the government had failed i also welcome the hearings because it is finally a forum where i can apologize to the loved ones of the victims of to the loved ones of the victims of  to them who are here in this room to those who are watching on television your government failed you those entrusted with protecting you failed you and i failed you we tried hard but that doesnt matter because we failed and for that failure i would ask once all the facts are out for your understanding and for your forgiveness many of the events clarke recounted during the hearings were also published in his memoir clarke charged that before and during the  crisis many in the administration were distracted from efforts against osama bin ladens alqaeda organization by a preoccupation with iraq and saddam hussein clarke had written that on september   president bush pulled him and a couple of aides aside and testily asked him to try to find evidence that saddam was connected to the terrorist attacks in response he wrote a report stating there was no evidence of iraqi involvement and got it signed by all relevant agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and the cia the paper was quickly returned by a deputy with a note saying please update and resubmit after initially denying that such a meeting between the president and clarke took place the white house later reversed its denial when others present backed clarkes version of the events supporting clarkes claim that in the months leading up to  what should have been considered an alarming amount of intelligence forewarning of attacks was delivered to the president former deputy attorney general jamie gorelick the sole member of the  commission permitted under an agreement with the bush adminstration to read the presidents daily brief reported in the hearings that information in the documents would set your hair on fire though barred by secrecy rules from disclosing much of the details contained in the documents she reported that they contained an extraordinary spike in intelligence warnings of alqaida attacks that had plateaued at a spike level for months before  criticismedit this sections tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on wikipedia see wikipedias guide to writing better articles for suggestions october  learn how and when to remove this template message before and after clarke appeared before the  commission some critics tried to attack his credibility launching a fullscale offensive against him impugning his personal motives claiming he was a disappointed jobhunter that he sought publicity and that he was a political partisan they charged that he exaggerated perceived failures in the bush administrations counterterrorism policies while exculpating the former clinton administration from its perceived shortcomings according to some reports the white house tried to discredit clarke in a move described as shooting the messenger new york times economics columnist paul krugman was more blunt calling the attacks on clarke a campaign of character assassination some republicans inside and outside the bush administration questioned both clarkes testimony and his tenure during the hearings senate republican majority leader bill frist took to the senate floor to make a speech alleging clarke told two entirely different stories under oath pointing to congressional hearing testimony clarke gave in  and his  commission testimony frist later speculated to reporters clarke was trading on his former service as a government insider with access to the nation’s most valuable intelligence to sell a book during clarkes earlier testimony he stated that bill clinton did not have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism during later testimony he stated that president clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism as summarized by the toledo blade in his august  briefing mr clarke told reporters  that the clinton administration had no overall plan on alqaeda to pass on to the bush administration  that just days after his inauguration mr bush said he wanted a new more comprehensive antiterror strategy  that mr bush ordered implementation of antiterror measures that had been kicking around since  and  that before sept  mr bush had increased fivefold the funding for cia covert action programs against alqaeda  its reasonable enough to argue that mr bush could have done more to guard against terror though it isnt clear what what is incredible is to argue—as mr clarke did before the  commission—that president clinton was more concerned about alqaeda than mr bush was  clarke was criticized for his suggestions in  of intelligence indicating a link between saddam hussein and alqaeda despite the fact clarke and others concluded after investigations by  that no link had been established in against all enemies he writes it is certainly possible that iraqi agents dangled the possibility of asylum in iraq before bin laden at some point when everyone knew that the us was pressuring the taliban to arrest him if that dangle happened bin ladens accepting asylum clearly did not p  in an interview on march   clarke claimed that theres absolutely no evidence that iraq was supporting alqaeda ever clarke claimed in his book that this conclusion was understood by the intelligence community at the time of  and the ensuing months but top bush administration officials were preoccupied with finding a link between iraq and  in the months that followed the attack and thus clarke argued the iraq war distracted attention and resources from the war in afghanistan and hunt for osama bin laden fox news allegedly with the administrations consent identified and released a background briefing that clarke gave in august  at the administrations request to minimize the fallout from a time magazine story about the presidents failure to take certain actions before  in that briefing on behalf of the white house clarke stated there was no plan on alqaeda that was passed from the clinton administration to the bush administration and that after taking office president bush decided to add to the existing clinton strategy and to increase cia resources for example for covert action fivefold to go after alqaeda at the next days hearing  commission member james thompson challenged clarke with the  account and clarke explained i was asked to make that case to the press i was a special assistant to the president and i made the case i was asked to make i was asked to highlight the positive aspects of what the administration had done and to minimize the negative aspects of what the administration had done and as a special assistant to the president one is frequently asked to do that kind of thing ive done it for several presidents another point of attack was clarkes role in allowing members of the bin laden family to fly to saudi arabia on september   according to clarkes statements to the  commission a request was relayed to clarke from the saudi embassy to allow the members of the bin laden family living in the us to fly home clarke testified to the commission that he passed this decision in turn to the fbi via dale watson and that the fbi at length sent its approval of the flight to the interagency crisis management group however fbi spokesman john iannarelli denied that the fbi had a role in approving the flight i can say unequivocally that the fbi had no role in facilitating these flights clarke has also exchanged criticism with michael scheuer former chief of the bin laden issue station at the cia when asked to respond to clarkes claim that scheuer was a hothead a middle manager who really didnt go to any of the cabinet meetings scheuer returned the criticism as follows i certainly agree with the fact that i didnt go to the cabinet meetings but im certainly also aware that im much better informed than mr clarke ever was about the nature of the intelligence that was available against osama bin laden and which was consistently denigrated by himself and mr tenet on march   at the height of the controversy during the  commission hearings clarke went on nbcs sunday morning news show meet the press and was interviewed by journalist tim russert in responding to and rebutting the criticism clarke challenged the bush administration to declassify the whole record including closed testimony by bush administration officials before the commission post government careeredit clarke is currently chairman of good harbor consulting and good harbour international two strategic planning and corporate risk management firms an onair consultant for abc news and a contributor to the good harbor report an online community discussing homeland security defense and politics he is an adjunct lecturer at the harvard kennedy school and a faculty affiliate of its belfer center for science and international affairs he has also become an author of fiction publishing his first novel the scorpions gate in  and a second breakpoint in  clarke wrote an oped for the washington post on may   harshly critical of other bush administration officials entitled the trauma of  is no excuse clarke wrote that he had little sympathy for his fellow officials who seemed to want to use the excuse of being traumatized and caught unaware by alqaedas attacks on the usa because their being caught unaware was due to their ignoring clear reports a major attack on us soil was imminent clarke particularly singled out former vice president dick cheney and former secretary of state condoleezza rice in april  clarke released his book on cyber war in april  clarke wrote a new york times oped addressing cyber attacks in stemming cyber attacks carried out by foreign governments and foreign hackers particularly from china clarke opined that the us government should be authorized to create a major program to grab stolen data leaving the country in a fashion similar to how the us department of homeland security currently searches for child pornography that crosses americas virtual borders moreover he suggested that the us president could authorize agencies to scan internet traffic outside the us and seize sensitive files stolen from within the united states clarke then stated that such a policy would not endanger privacy rights through the institution of a privacy advocate who could stop abuses or any activity that went beyond halting the theft of important files the oped did not offer evidence that finding and blocking files while they are being transmitted is technically feasible in september  clarke stated that middle eastern governments were likely behind hacking incidents against several banks during the same year he also endorsed barack obamas reelection for president of the united states following the  highspeed fatal car crash of journalist michael hastings a vocal critic of the surveillance state and restrictions on the press freedom under the obama administration tenure clarke was quoted as saying there is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers—including the united states—know how to remotely seize control of a car so if there were a cyber attack on the car—and im not saying there was i think whoever did it would probably get away with it in  clarke served on an advisory group for the obama administration as it sought to reform nsa spying programs following the revelations of documents released by edward snowden the report mentioned in recommendation  on page  that the national security council staff should manage an interagency process to review on a regular basis the activities of the us government regarding attacks that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application clarke told reuters on  april  that the nsa had not known

ramzi yousef one of the main perpetrators of the  world trade center bombing who traveled to the united states on an iraqi passport yousef is the nephew of khalid sheikh mohammed a senior alqaeda member many in the clinton administration and the intelligence community believed this was evidence linking alqaedas activities and the government of iraq in february  clarke wrote the deputy national security advisor that one reliable source reported iraqi officials had met with bin ladin and may have offered him asylum therefore clarke advised against surveillance flights to track bin laden in afghanistan anticipating an attack “old wily usama will likely boogie to baghdad” where he would be impossible to find clarke also made statements that year to the press linking iraqi nerve gas experts and alqaeda to an alleged jointchemicalweaponsdevelopment effort at the al shifa pharmaceutical plant in sudan michael scheuer is the former chief of the bin laden unit at the counterterrorist center at the cia matthew continetti writes scheuer believes that clarke’s risk aversion and politicking negatively impacted the hunt for bin laden prior to september   scheuer stated that his unit codename alec had provided information that could have led to the capture and or killing of osama bin laden on ten different occasions during the clinton administration only to have his recommendations for action turned down by senior intelligence officials including clarke bush administrationedit clarke and his communications with the bush administration regarding bin laden and associated terrorist plots targeting the united states were mentioned frequently in condoleezza rices public interview by the  investigatory commission on april   of particular significance was a memo from january   that clarke had authored and sent to condoleezza rice along with making an urgent request for a meeting of the national security councils principals committee to discuss the growing alqaeda threat in the greater middle east the memo also suggests strategies for combating alqaeda that might be adopted by the new bush administration in his memoir against all enemies clarke wrote that condoleezza rice made a decision that the position of national coordinator for counterterrorism should be downgraded by demoting the office the administration sent a signal through the national security bureaucracy about the salience they assigned to terrorism no longer would clarkes memos go to the president instead they had to pass through a chain of command of national security advisor condoleezza rice and her deputy stephen hadley who bounced every one of them back within a week of the inauguration i wrote to rice and hadley asking urgently for a principals or cabinetlevel meeting to review the imminent alqaeda threat rice told me that the principals committee which had been the first venue for terrorism policy discussions in the clinton administration would not address the issue until it had been framed by the deputies the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states reported in its eighth public hearing clarke asked on several occasions for early principals meetings on these issues and was frustrated that no early meeting was scheduled no principals committee meetings on al qaeda were held until september th  at the first deputies committee meeting on terrorism held in april  clarke strongly suggested that the us put pressure on both the taliban and alqaeda by arming the northern alliance and other groups in afghanistan simultaneously that they target bin laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the mq predators to which deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz responded well i just dont understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin laden clarke replied that he was talking about bin laden and his network because it posed an immediate and serious threat to the united states according to clarke wolfowitz turned to him and said you give bin laden too much credit he could not do all these things like the  attack on new york not without a state sponsor just because fbi and cia have failed to find the linkages does not mean they dont exist clarke wrote in against all enemies that in the summer of  the intelligence community was convinced of an imminent attack by al qaeda but could not get the attention of the highest levels of the bush administration most famously writing that director of the central intelligence agency george tenet was running around with his hair on fire at a july   white house gathering of the faa the coast guard the fbi secret service and ins clarke stated that something really spectacular is going to happen here and its going to happen soon  cyberterrorism and cybersecurityedit clarke as special advisor to the president on cybersecurity spent his last year in the bush administration focusing on cybersecurity and the threat of terrorism against the critical infrastructure of the united states at a security conference in  after citing statistics that indicate that less than  percent of corporate revenue on average is spent on informationtechnology security clarke was famously heard to say if you spend more on coffee than on it security then you will be hacked whats more you deserve to be hacked in june  clarke discussed issues of cybersecurity in depth in an interview on the colbert report in which he was seemingly misled into thinking that they were discussing cybersecurity threats from the chinese through the use of mobile devices such as ipads instead stephen colbert was doing a humorous piece on the threats of orangutans learning to use ipads indeed when confronted on the issue directly clarke himself clarified that he was not discussing nonhuman primate based cyberterrorism threats orangutans you mean like apes said clarke are you shtin me im talking about the chinese  commissionedit on march   clarke testified at the public  commission hearings at the outset of his testimony clarke offered an apology to the families of  victims and an acknowledgment that the government had failed i also welcome the hearings because it is finally a forum where i can apologize to the loved ones of the victims of to the loved ones of the victims of  to them who are here in this room to those who are watching on television your government failed you those entrusted with protecting you failed you and i failed you we tried hard but that doesnt matter because we failed and for that failure i would ask once all the facts are out for your understanding and for your forgiveness many of the events clarke recounted during the hearings were also published in his memoir clarke charged that before and during the  crisis many in the administration were distracted from efforts against osama bin ladens alqaeda organization by a preoccupation with iraq and saddam hussein clarke had written that on september   president bush pulled him and a couple of aides aside and testily asked him to try to find evidence that saddam was connected to the terrorist attacks in response he wrote a report stating there was no evidence of iraqi involvement and got it signed by all relevant agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and the cia the paper was quickly returned by a deputy with a note saying please update and resubmit after initially denying that such a meeting between the president and clarke took place the white house later reversed its denial when others present backed clarkes version of the events supporting clarkes claim that in the months leading up to  what should have been considered an alarming amount of intelligence forewarning of attacks was delivered to the president former deputy attorney general jamie gorelick the sole member of the  commission permitted under an agreement with the bush adminstration to read the presidents daily brief reported in the hearings that information in the documents would set your hair on fire though barred by secrecy rules from disclosing much of the details contained in the documents she reported that they contained an extraordinary spike in intelligence warnings of alqaida attacks that had plateaued at a spike level for months before  criticismedit this sections tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on wikipedia see wikipedias guide to writing better articles for suggestions october  learn how and when to remove this template message before and after clarke appeared before the  commission some critics tried to attack his credibility launching a fullscale offensive against him impugning his personal motives claiming he was a disappointed jobhunter that he sought publicity and that he was a political partisan they charged that he exaggerated perceived failures in the bush administrations counterterrorism policies while exculpating the former clinton administration from its perceived shortcomings according to some reports the white house tried to discredit clarke in a move described as shooting the messenger new york times economics columnist paul krugman was more blunt calling the attacks on clarke a campaign of character assassination some republicans inside and outside the bush administration questioned both clarkes testimony and his tenure during the hearings senate republican majority leader bill frist took to the senate floor to make a speech alleging clarke told two entirely different stories under oath pointing to congressional hearing testimony clarke gave in  and his  commission testimony frist later speculated to reporters clarke was trading on his former service as a government insider with access to the nation’s most valuable intelligence to sell a book during clarkes earlier testimony he stated that bill clinton did not have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism during later testimony he stated that president clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism as summarized by the toledo blade in his august  briefing mr clarke told reporters  that the clinton administration had no overall plan on alqaeda to pass on to the bush administration  that just days after his inauguration mr bush said he wanted a new more comprehensive antiterror strategy  that mr bush ordered implementation of antiterror measures that had been kicking around since  and  that before sept  mr bush had increased fivefold the funding for cia covert action programs against alqaeda  its reasonable enough to argue that mr bush could have done more to guard against terror though it isnt clear what what is incredible is to argue—as mr clarke did before the  commission—that president clinton was more concerned about alqaeda than mr bush was  clarke was criticized for his suggestions in  of intelligence indicating a link between saddam hussein and alqaeda despite the fact clarke and others concluded after investigations by  that no link had been established in against all enemies he writes it is certainly possible that iraqi agents dangled the possibility of asylum in iraq before bin laden at some point when everyone knew that the us was pressuring the taliban to arrest him if that dangle happened bin ladens accepting asylum clearly did not p  in an interview on march   clarke claimed that theres absolutely no evidence that iraq was supporting alqaeda ever clarke claimed in his book that this conclusion was understood by the intelligence community at the time of  and the ensuing months but top bush administration officials were preoccupied with finding a link between iraq and  in the months that followed the attack and thus clarke argued the iraq war distracted attention and resources from the war in afghanistan and hunt for osama bin laden fox news allegedly with the administrations consent identified and released a background briefing that clarke gave in august  at the administrations request to minimize the fallout from a time magazine story about the presidents failure to take certain actions before  in that briefing on behalf of the white house clarke stated there was no plan on alqaeda that was passed from the clinton administration to the bush administration and that after taking office president bush decided to add to the existing clinton strategy and to increase cia resources for example for covert action fivefold to go after alqaeda at the next days hearing  commission member james thompson challenged clarke with the  account and clarke explained i was asked to make that case to the press i was a special assistant to the president and i made the case i was asked to make i was asked to highlight the positive aspects of what the administration had done and to minimize the negative aspects of what the administration had done and as a special assistant to the president one is frequently asked to do that kind of thing ive done it for several presidents another point of attack was clarkes role in allowing members of the bin laden family to fly to saudi arabia on september   according to clarkes statements to the  commission a request was relayed to clarke from the saudi embassy to allow the members of the bin laden family living in the us to fly home clarke testified to the commission that he passed this decision in turn to the fbi via dale watson and that the fbi at length sent its approval of the flight to the interagency crisis management group however fbi spokesman john iannarelli denied that the fbi had a role in approving the flight i can say unequivocally that the fbi had no role in facilitating these flights clarke has also exchanged criticism with michael scheuer former chief of the bin laden issue station at the cia when asked to respond to clarkes claim that scheuer was a hothead a middle manager who really didnt go to any of the cabinet meetings scheuer returned the criticism as follows i certainly agree with the fact that i didnt go to the cabinet meetings but im certainly also aware that im much better informed than mr clarke ever was about the nature of the intelligence that was available against osama bin laden and which was consistently denigrated by himself and mr tenet on march   at the height of the controversy during the  commission hearings clarke went on nbcs sunday morning news show meet the press and was interviewed by journalist tim russert in responding to and rebutting the criticism clarke challenged the bush administration to declassify the whole record including closed testimony by bush administration officials before the commission post government careeredit clarke is currently chairman of good harbor consulting and good harbour international two strategic planning and corporate risk management firms an onair consultant for abc news and a contributor to the good harbor report an online community discussing homeland security defense and politics he is an adjunct lecturer at the harvard kennedy school and a faculty affiliate of its belfer center for science and international affairs he has also become an author of fiction publishing his first novel the scorpions gate in  and a second breakpoint in  clarke wrote an oped for the washington post on may   harshly critical of other bush administration officials entitled the trauma of  is no excuse clarke wrote that he had little sympathy for his fellow officials who seemed to want to use the excuse of being traumatized and caught unaware by alqaedas attacks on the usa because their being caught unaware was due to their ignoring clear reports a major attack on us soil was imminent clarke particularly singled out former vice president dick cheney and former secretary of state condoleezza rice in april  clarke released his book on cyber war in april  clarke wrote a new york times oped addressing cyber attacks in stemming cyber attacks carried out by foreign governments and foreign hackers particularly from china clarke opined that the us government should be authorized to create a major program to grab stolen data leaving the country in a fashion similar to how the us department of homeland security currently searches for child pornography that crosses americas virtual borders moreover he suggested that the us president could authorize agencies to scan internet traffic outside the us and seize sensitive files stolen from within the united states clarke then stated that such a policy would not endanger privacy rights through the institution of a privacy advocate who could stop abuses or any activity that went beyond halting the theft of important files the oped did not offer evidence that finding and blocking files while they are being transmitted is technically feasible in september  clarke stated that middle eastern governments were likely behind hacking incidents against several banks during the same year he also endorsed barack obamas reelection for president of the united states following the  highspeed fatal car crash of journalist michael hastings a vocal critic of the surveillance state and restrictions on the press freedom under the obama administration tenure clarke was quoted as saying there is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers—including the united states—know how to remotely seize control of a car so if there were a cyber attack on the car—and im not saying there was i think whoever did it would probably get away with it in  clarke served on an advisory group for the obama administration as it sought to reform nsa spying programs following the revelations of documents released by edward snowden the report mentioned in recommendation  on page  that the national security council staff should manage an interagency process to review on a regular basis the activities of the us government regarding attacks that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application clarke told reuters on  april  that the nsa had not known of heartbleed in a  interview clarke said he was confident that russia would be back to interfere with the  and  elections and that russia was also culpable for a pretend ransomware attack written
