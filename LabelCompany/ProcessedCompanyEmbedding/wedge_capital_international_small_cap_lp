our quantitative process examines a multitude of factors within four main categories to gauge the return potential of a stock first we seek relatively inexpensive valuations second we want to see accelerating earnings growth prospects and upward earnings estimate revisions from the sellside analysts who cover the stock third we look for positive recent momentum since recent trends tend to persist and fourth we want to find quality by seeking stocks with a focus on strong free cash flow generation rather than simply sales growth we then rank the stocks on these factors to identify candidates that we believe should produce the most attractive riskadjusted returns before we establish new positions our fundamental portfolio managers and analysts have the opportunity to review stocks in their sector of coverage and report any “red flags” that may be outside the scope of quantitative analysis we take many steps to monitor and manage risk within the portfolio we start by including in our tradable universe only the roughly  stocks that trade at least  million per day on average to seek sufficient liquidity and to minimize market impact when we enter and exit positions we intend for the portfolio to also typically contain between  and  stocks at any one time and this breadth is intended to limit idiosyncratic risk see details commentary performance review for the

strongest returns within the msci acwi ex usa small cap index “index” came from financials materials and industrials energy utilities and consumer staples delivered the weakest sector returns smaller capitalization equities performed broadly inline with larger capitalization equities in june with stronger performance in developed markets offsetting weaker performance in emerging markets causeway

categories valuation earnings growth technical indicators and quality value posted the strongest returns for the month of june among our factor groups and value remains the bestperforming factor group over the calendar yeartodate period and over the past  months earnings growth factors posted slightly negative returns for june and earnings growth is the worst performing factor group over the  yeartodate period though its returns are nevertheless positive technical factors were positive for june but they are the worst performing group over the past twelve months the financial strength factor group posted positive returns in june and financial strength remains the most consistent factor group in the last twelve months with only one month of negative returns all factor group returns are positive over the  yeartodate period and all remain positive on an inceptiontodate basis fund holdings across all eleven sectors contributed to relative performance the top contributing sectors included materials real estate and industrials holdings in the telecommunication services utilities and health care sectors contributed least to relative performance june’s strong performance was
