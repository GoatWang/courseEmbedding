section and the second section description technical field  the present invention pertains to a device for use with centrifuges and specifically to adaptive media which holds sample containers to be subjected to centrifugal force background of the invention  centrifuge instruments are in common use in research and industrial applications to subject samples to centrifugal force thereby separating sample components by sedimentation properties the liquid sample is placed in a container and placed in or attached to a centrifuge rotor the centrifuge rotor is then rotated by the centrifuge instrument to effect a separation of the components of the liquid sample  containers of various sizes and shapes may need to be used in a separation procedure a rotor for a centrifuge is commonly constructed to hold sample containers having a different diameter or shape than the containers that are actually used to hold a sample to allow use of a variety of containers adapters are commonly used with the centrifuge rotor such adapters are commonly constructed of a polymeric material but not limited to and constructed as a single piece having a shape which allows retention of one or more containers in which a sample may be placed the adapter is inserted into a device mounted on or in a centrifuge rotor the labware holding the sample is inserted in the adapter  for example us pat no  discloses an adapter for centrifuge containers having an open top an interior surface and an exterior surface the exterior surface of the adapter conforms to the bottom of a cavity in a centrifuge rotor device such as a swinging bucket held by a rotor the interior surface of the sample container has an internal sidewall and a bottom having a well to hold a pellet of denser material which has migrated under a centrifugal force the pellet well extends radially outward from the center of rotation when the adapter is used with a swinging bucket rotor this configuration allows the pellet to be confined to a localized area resulting in allowing a more compact pellet which remains intact as the adapter is extracted from the centrifuge rotor  in designing of centrifuge adapters one issue of concern is preventing agitation of the sample following a centrifuge procedure agitation of the sample may cause particulate or denser sample component to become mixed with less dense liquids for example us pat no  discloses a tube adapter for centrifuge rotor which includes a plurality of recessed grooves at the top of the adapter to allow engagement of a prong of a removal tool to extract the adapter from the recess of the rotor such a system allows an adapter to be extracted even if the adapter sticks somewhat to the recess of a body of a centrifuge rotor however the disadvantage of using such an extraction system is substantial resuspension of the separated sample material  the body of a centrifuge rotor is most commonly made of a metal alloy the adapters are often made of an elastomeric or polymeric material such resilient plastic may stick against the surface of the rotor requiring some force in extraction this is compounded by the centrifugal force of rotation which exerts pressure on the adapter into the rotor body in addition to spilled or condensed liquids close tolerances may seal the adapter into a receiving receptacle creating a vacuum which is difficult to break  to allow better integrity of a sample following centrifuge rotation a number of split body tube adapters have been devised for example us pat no  discloses a split body adapter which may be hinged at a seam when the two sections of the adapter are brought into opposing alignment a recess within the adapter body forms a cavity for receiving a centrifuge tube these two recessed sections may be substantially identical during the application of centrifugal force the behavior of the adapter and the sample container may differ since the adapter is usually made of a different material than the sample container in many cases the tube deforms into the interior cavity of the adapter following the deceleration of the centrifuge rotor the sample container must be removed from the adapter for subsequent processing and analysis of the sample within the sample container the described adapter allows the sample container to be removed with reduced force this allows integrity of the separated sample to be maintained us pat nos   and  disclose a family of related adapters having a pair of hinged adapter body parts which are closed over all or part of a sample container another adapter configuration is disclosed in us pat no  in which a sample container is inserted into a centrally cylindrical recess in a tube adapter a clamp on the bottom of the adapter extends over a second piece of a top inserted over the centrifuge container this forms a single adapter unit which may subsequently be subjected to centrifugal forces us pat no  discloses an adapter for fixed angle centrifuge rotor including a pair of adapter sections which are pressed together to form a unitary structure surrounding a sample container  while the above adapters have provided a number of alternatives for use with centrifuge rotors and subjecting sample containers to centrifugal forces some problems remain for a number of sample containers it remains difficult to extract sample containers from the adapter and the adapter from a centrifuge rotor and such extraction may agitate the sample thus reducing the separation efficiency  additional concerns exist for centrifuge separation using more fragile sample containers that are in common use one example of such containers are cell culture flasks also referred to as tissue culture flasks cell culture flasks are commonly made of polystyrene or some other similar material cell culture flasks generally have a rectangular cross section this allows efficient stacking of the flasks on incubators for incubation of cell cultures such flasks generally are comprised of two or more parts attached at a seam by ultrasonic welding or similar attachment means large numbers of such flasks are presently used for a number of different cell culture processes including culture of adherent cells and suspension cell culture the current use of such cell culture flasks for the growth of cell cultures does not subject the flask to vacuum or any pressures beyond ambient pressure  g times the force of gravity  it would be advantageous to be able to harvest cells within cell culture flasks common protocols currently require that cells grown in tissue culture flasks be subsequently transferred to an alternative container such a conical tube prior to subjecting cells to harvesting by centrifugal force the cells may then be separated from the surrounding media which would be decanted or aspirated to remove this liquid the cells may then be resuspended in a new media and subsequently regrown these procedures have a number of drawbacks first a large number of sample containers must be used in each transfer step with attendant cost of labware and disposal of used labware second an experimentalists time is required for each transfer step third each transfer step from a flask to a centrifuge container such as a conical tube has the risk of contaminating cell lines such cell lines may be rare and expensive and represent many hours of preparation effort finally the transfer of cells from the cell culture flask may result in loss of cells and possibly degradation of cell lines given the time and expense of preparation of such cell lines minimization of transfer steps would be beneficial  it is an object of the invention to provide a centrifuge container adapter which facilitates removal of the adapter from the rotor with minimal mixing of separated sample it is a further object that such an adapter be lightweight it is a further object of the invention to provide an adapter which is adaptable to use with cell culture flasks such an adapter would maintain of the integrity of these flasks while still allowing efficient separation summary of the invention  the above objects have been achieved with an adapter to hold a sample container having features that allow for efficient separation in various embodiments these features support the sample container accommodate raised features on the outer surface of sample containers and allow a container to be spun and removed from an adapter with minimal disturbance of the separated sample material in one embodiment a recessed portion of each adapter section are brought together into alignment by the hinge such that the recessed portions form a pocket which holds a centrifuge container the sections are separated by a slit extending from the open top of the pocket to a location proximate to the bottom of the pocket the walls of the pocket have ribs which run down the length of the wall of the pocket providing support to a container wall inserted in the pocket  the present adapter may include a number of features a first such feature is ribbing on the exterior surface of the adapter that contacts the rotor device into which the adapter is inserted exterior ribbing will reduce friction during extraction of the adapter a second feature is through holes extending through the adapter sections to reduce adapter mass and ease extraction of the adapter from a rotor device by breaking any vacuum between the rotor device and the adapter a third feature is a vent hole that passes through the bottom of the sample container pocket to break any suction between the bottom of the adapter and a rotor device used with the present adapter a fourth feature is a hinge groove to reduce the thickness of material at the hinge location and to increase the durability of the hinge a fifth feature is a slit that may include a cutout at the lowest portion of the slit which also would add to the durability of the hinge a sixth feature is an orientation indicia to indicate to a user the proper alignment of the sample container to the adapter and the adapter with the rotor device  a seventh feature is the presence of one or more grooves in the interior of the pocket to prevent force load from concentrating on a ridge seam leg or other protrusion from the exterior surface on the sample container for cell culture flask adapters the relatively delicate seam is fit into an adapter seam groove such that the centrifugal force is distributed onto the walls of the flask these walls are supported by the pocket ribs thus preventing seam failure the legs of the sample container and stacking ridges on the edges of the sides of the sample container also may be accommodated in a recess the ribs extend to prevent the load from bearing onto the ridges or legs and instead allow the load to be distributed across the surface of the sides or bottom of the flask during centrifugal rotation an eighth feature of the present invention is handles which may be used to compress the sections of the adapter together to aid in extraction of the adapter from a centrifuge rotor  the adapter may include more than one pocket and may include more than two sections defining the pockets  one aspect of the present invention is a method of using the present adapter in one embodiment of this method for use with cell culture flasks the adapter is inserted into the rotor device so that the separated sample material that forms a pellet during centrifugal rotation is distributed along a side of the flask which does not have a weld seam this prevents a load from concentrating at the seam and endangering the seam orientation − degrees of alignment should be toleratedbrief description of the drawings  fig  is a perspective view of

a top view of an alternate embodiment of the adapterdetailed description of the invention  with reference to fig  a first embodiment of a tissue culture adapter  and an associated cell culture flask  to be held by adapter  is shown the flask is shown in the proper insertion orientation such that the flask would be held securely by the adapter  with respect to the tissue culture flask  such flasks are typically manufactured as two parts joined together at seam  such parts are joined by ultrasonic welding or another bonding means ultrasonic welding may be preferred to the use of an adhesive to prevent outgassing problems such tissue culture flasks are generally designed to be used at ambient pressure  g applications in a typical experiment a tissue culture flask is partially filled with a growth media seeded with cells and placed in a suitable environment such a controlled environment may be an incubator on such an incubator the flask is placed flat allowing both efficient stacking of the flasks and providing a large surface area one flat side of the flask for cell growth this orientation also provides a greater surface area of the media to exchange gases with the air above the growth media the flask may have a vented cap to allow gas exchange a hydrophobic liner in the cap retains liquid within the flask such incubators may be fully enclosed by a housing allowing control of the environment at which cells are grown  flasks are typically made of a clear polymeric material such as polystyrene or other similar polymer the flasks are designed to allow visual inspection by a researcher of the contents of the flask contents large surfaces of the walls of the flasks are relatively thin and unsupported and the two halves of the flasks are secured by simple bonded joint such flasks are produced as a disposable product and are consumed by millions each year these flasks were originally not designed to be subjected to centrifugal force the present adapter allows  to  relative centrifugal force g force range to be applied to the flask to separate cells from growing media without compromising the structural integrity of the tissue culture flask  the structure of the flask must be accommodated by any adapter seam  the location of the attachment of the two parts forming the flask is a raised seam extending on two sides top and bottom of the flask in addition the flasks commonly have legs  to allow the flask to stand upright on a flat surface these structures must be accommodated by any adapter  adapter  allows tissue culture flask to be easily inserted and removed from adapter  the adapter is comprised of a first adapter section a and a second adapter section b slits  extend from the top of the adapter to approximate to the bottom of the adapter this allows adapter sections a b to flex in opposing directions providing an easier insertion and removal of an associated tissue culture flask into the interior pocket   extending through the body of adapter  are through holes  these through holes serve both to lighten the overall weight of adapter  and to help release any suction which might occur at the bottom of adapter  between the adapter and a swinging bucket type rotor through holes  also serve to reduce the buckling load placed on the flat face of the flask  flask  is received into pocket  of adapter  pocket  has an interior surface  having a plurality of ribs  disposed throughout the interior of the pocket these ribs extend from the opening of the adapter to the bottom floor of the adapter when flask  is inserted into adapter  the ribs provide support to the sides of the flasks while at the same time preventing the relatively softer material from which the adapter is manufactured from adhering to the relatively harder material of which flask  is made the ribs  also by design and shape contribute to supporting the large flat flask face while not significantly loading it also the ribs assist with extraction of the adapter by making the adapter more compressible in one embodiment ribs  reduce the contact area between the adapter and the side walls of the container by   external support ribs  which provide additional side support to pocket  are located proximate to slit  on the exterior  of the adapter  on each of two sides of adapter  in addition support ribs  reduce the overall weight of the adapter by providing a support structure for the adapter against the side of the bucket into which the adapter will be inserted ribs  also reduce loading on side  of tissue culture flask  the steps to reduce loading of the tissue culture flask  are important because flask  does not have structural support to withstand significant side loads at the location of seam  on tissue culture flask  empirical testing has demonstrated that excessive side loading on side  and the flat face  at the location of seam  on the tissue culture flask  may cause failure of the tissue culture flask seam  even at relatively low centrifugal loads  with respect to fig a it can be seen that flask  may be inserted into adapter  which is subsequently fit into rotor bucket  rotor bucket  has pivot mounts  allowing this bucket to be mounted onto a centrifuge rotor upon rotation the orientation of the bucket changes so that the bucket is on its side this presents the bottom of the flask at the greatest radial distance from the center of the rotation sample components of greater density then migrate to the bottom of the flask inserted into adapter  held in bucket  this is explained in greater detail in relation to fig   the top view of adapter  shown in fig  illustrates the details of the construction of the adapter device through holes  extend from the top surface  of the adapter through the bottom of adapter  pocket  holds the cell culture flask at the bottom of pocket  grooves  on bottom surface  allow the support legs of the flask shown as element  on flask  in fig  to be accommodated in this embodiment the bottom contact between adapter and container bottom is reduced to  of the bottom surface ribs on bottom surface  ribs not shown may further reduce the contact area while still providing adequate support for the container bottom also on bottom surface  at the bottom of pocket  is seam groove  extending between the sides of the adapter this seam groove allows the seam of a tissue culture flask to be fit into the adapter positioning of the seam groove  and the side slits  of adapter  may be changed depending on the construction of the tissue culture flask being used with the adapter the placement of the seam on various different flasks manufactured by different makers may vary this flask seam may be on edge of one flat face of the flask or may be between the sides of the flask in addition the locations of slits  are preferably aligned with the location of seam groove  thus the two halves sections of the adapter created by slits  may be unequal as is shown in fig  in addition slits  may not always be aligned with seam groove   ribs  extend from proximate to the top surface  to proximate to the bottom surface  extending down interior surface  in pocket  these ribs extend down all four sides of pocket  during rotation the adapter ribs  support but not crush the sides of a flask inserted in the adapter  the section lines bb shown in fig  indicates the cross section shown in fig  this view shows a cell culture flask  inserted into adapter  this view illustrates an edge side  of tissue culture flask  commonly tissue culture flasks will have a peripheral ridge  to allow stacked flasks on an incubator to be interlocked together these elevated ridges extend along the sides top and bottom of the tissue culture flasks along edges on the front and back side of the tissue culture flask the support ribs  must extend below the plane created by the tissue flask ridges  in order to support the flat faces of the sides of the tissue culture flasks in this design the tissue culture flask ridges  extend to the face of the side of the adapter as indicated at locations   if the adapter did not have side slots which divide the internal pocket of the adapter into sections the tissue culture flask would be removed by grasping the top of the flask and extracting the flask upward during this upward dragging the external ridges  would be rubbed against the material of the inner pocket given the fact that the tissue culture flask is made of a rigid polymeric material such as polystyrene and that the adapter is made of a softer polymer such as polyurethane the resulting drag would cause agitation of the tissue culture flask and risk resuspension of the pelleted cells or other separated material such agitation of the separated sample is not desirable given that it reduces the separation efficiency and yield of separated material the present design overcomes this disadvantage by allowing the adapter to partially flex open for removal of the flask  a dotted circle c of fig  is illustrated in fig a this illustrates the hinge section of the adapter seam groove  eliminates the concentration of the centrifugal force on the relatively weak seam  of the tissue culture flasks while locating bottom surface  of the tissue culture flask onto bottom surface  of the adapter pocket a hinge  is formed along the bottom of the adapter offset by flask seam groove  and opposing bottom notch  notch  reduces the thickness of hinge  this increases the life of the hinge in addition the use of notch  also limits the angular degree to which hinge  may open when the halves of the adapter are moved in opposite directions an interior pocket vent hole  allows any suction created between the rotor device eg swinging bucket and the tissue culture flask adapter to be broken during extraction of the tissue culture flask from the adapter this may be particularly important if liquid is present in the rotor device creating a seal which would be broken by hole  to aid in removal of the adapter talc or other similar powder may be dusted onto the adapter  sectional lines aa shown in fig  represent a crosssectional view of the adapter illustrated in fig  again with the tissue culture flask  shown inserted in adapter  in this side view the bottom surface  of tissue culture flask  rests on surface  at the bottom of the internal pocket of adapter  legs  on tissue culture flask  are received into leg notches  this allows the adapter to support the bottom surface of the tissue culture flask thus distributing the load to which the bottom of the tissue culture flask is subjected during centrifugal rotation  in figs  and  alternate embodiments of the adapters in which the sample containers are held at an angle are shown by lines a b on fig  and c d on fig  the recess grooves ribs and other features on the adapters would be repositioned to allow for support of the walls of the sample container and to provide an accommodating space for protruding elements on the container  fig  illustrates a top view of the adapter of the present invention with the adapter illustrated holding a tissue culture flask  this view illustrates the features of the present adapter which allow the force exerted during a centrifugal rotation of the flask to be evenly distributed about the sides of the flask flask seam  is positioned at seam groove  on the adapter thus the support forces are not concentrated at seam groove  similarly the flask ridge  is contained in corner recess  such that ridge  does not bear the full load of the centrifugal forces side face  on the flask is supported by ribs  which extend down into the container pocket and are spaced along the interior wall of the pocket in which flask  is inserted these ribs may be evenly spaced or may be grouped the contact area of rib  is sufficient to support yet not overload flask sidewall  while still allowing ease of extraction and insertion of the flask from the adapter  adapter  includes through holes  which decreases the weight of the adapter between through holes  is ribbing  which provides support to the tissue culture flask sidewall  and also controls the buckling of wall  the ribbing  will not transfer the load to the flask wall while the adapter wall is undergoing distortion and loading during centrifugation  the positioning of slot  and seam groove  are aligned and positioned on the adapter to receive seam  on cell culture flask this groove both prevents the concentration of force at the relatively weak seam  and allows the tissue culture flask to be extracted without disturbing a separated sample locating slot  at seam  provides the optimal location for the seam at which the adapter is allowed to flex open given that seam  represents the widest part of the tissue culture flask  an alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in fig  this embodiment includes features which make the adapter  both easier to remove from a centrifuge rotor swinging bucket and includes features which increase the life of the device  external ribs  also shown in fig  on adapter  reduce the surface contact between the adapter and a device attached to a centrifuge rotor into which the adapter is inserted eg swinging bucket reducing the surface contact between the relatively harder material of the rotor device and the relatively softer material of the centrifuge adapter reduces the friction between these surfaces as the adapter is removed from the rotor device eg swinging bucket this is a first means by which agitation of the sample is minimized in this embodiment a second means by which extraction of the adapter is aided is through the use of finger grips  the location of finger grip  is set back from the face of the flask  as indicated by width  this in addition to rib  prevents the finger grips  from contacting the side walls of flask  during a centrifuge rotation procedure this prevents additional forces from being exerted onto the sides of flask  thereby preventing damage to the flask the distance of setback  from the face of flask  should be at least as great as the width  of slot  support strip  is attached from the top of the adapter to the side of finger grip  constraining the movement of finger grip  in the direction of the flask during centrifugation as illustrated in figs  and  a textured surface  on finger grips  aids the user in extracting the adapter from a bucket into which the adapter has been inserted exerting force on finger grips  brings the opposing halves of the adapter closer together narrowing the width of slit  this retracts adapter  from sides of the bucket into which the adapter has been inserted reducing the drag during removal or insertion between the adapter and the bucket  the finger grips  acts to bring the opposing sections of the adapter together the sections pivot along the bottom of the adapter at hinge  two features of the hinge  aid in extending the life of the hinge the first is bottom groove  extending along the bottom of adapter  this groove and the seam groove  seen in fig a reduces the thickness of hinge  and additionally restricts the degree to which the halves of adapter  may be moves in opposite directions in addition cutout  at the base of slot  also prevents tearing of the hinge thereby increasing the durability of the hinge during repeated extractions and insertions of associated sample containers  figs  and  show views of an alternative embodiment in which multiple flasks are held in a single adapter in this embodiment each pocket a b has an associated slot allowing the adapter to separately flex as in prior embodiments this feature enables insertion or removal of each of the individual flasks the number of pockets used may be based on the flask size selected by an experimentalist the through holes  in this embodiment extend around the circumference of the adapter  although not shown with finger grips such grips may be added to aid in removal of adapter  from an associated centrifuge rotor device  the vertical slots  again extend from the top of the adapter to proximate to the bottom of adapter slots on opposing sides of each of pockets a b allow each pocket to individually flex open the location of the slots in this illustrated embodiment is not aligned with the seams  of the flask in addition it may be advantageous in certain circumstances to include multiple slots for each pocket such slots could be positioned at the edges of the pockets at the location of seam groove   as shown in fig  the bottoms of pockets a b contain seam grooves  and grooves  to accommodate the seams of the flask and the leg struts  of the flasks shown in fig  the use of multiple seam grooves at the bottom may allow a number of different flask models of similar size from different manufactures to be used with a single adapter in addition such seam grooves on both sides of the bottom of the pocket may allow the flask to be oriented in either direction  figs a and b show the top view of the flask adapter inserted in a swinging bucket centrifuge rotor at rest and during centrifugal rotation respectively the orientation of the flask may be critical it is preferable for the longer dimension of the flask to be oriented along the radius to the center of rotation when the flask is at rest this orientation should be plus or minus  degrees as shown by angle a in fig a during rotation of the flask the radially greatest distance in the flask will be at the bottom corner of the flask along the longer side of the flask indicated at  on fig b hydraulic loading during the sample separation ie application of centrifugal force will stress a seam if this force is concentrated on the seam thus it is preferred that the sample container be oriented such that hydraulic load is distributed along the longest dimension of the flask and preferably also away from the side of the flask on which the seam is located this further attenuates risk of excessive force on the flask particularly force concentrated along the edge of the flask having the seam causing seam failure using this orientation allows maximization of the centrifugal forces that can be applied to the cell culture flask the typical forces of  relative centrifugal force range used to separate cells from a growth media may be used with the present adapter in this orientation  an indicia mark  in fig a on the adapter may allow a user to quickly identify the proper orientation of the adapter in a bucket for example an arrow or other symbol on the adapter may be aligned with manufactures writing on the swinging bucket to allow for proper orientation of the adapter and flask in the bucket in addition orientation indices on the sample container or adapter could be used to indicate to a user proper insertion direction this would be helpful to insure that the flask or other container is inserted into an adapter such that a seam ridge or other ridge on the sample container is fit into a recess or groove on the adapter  with respect to figs  and  an alternative embodiment of an adapter and flask are shown a number of tubes used in centrifuge separations include a conical bottom or other recessed or narrowed diameter space at the bottom of the tube to concentrate cells or other separated material in a localized area it may be desirable to design a cell culture flask having a similar feature to allow simplified separations as shown in figs  and  the present adapter may accommodate such flasks the elements of previous adapters including through holes to reduce the weight of the adapter internal and external ribbing slots to simplify insertion and removal of the flask from the adapter and other features could be included in this device in addition flask  could include stacking ridges and other features of tissue culture flasks described above  the use of the adapters are illustrated in the following examples example  starting cell lines from frozen stock  this process begins by releasing a cell line from a stock such as frozen cells from a cell registry and depository with the current protocol the cell line pellet is thawed and may be transferred to a conical tube containing media this conical tube would then be subjected to centrifugal force for example  to  revolutions per minutes for  to  minutes at room temperature to pellet the cells to the bottom of the tube the supernatant would then be removed for instance by pipette removal or decanting a media would be added to the conical tube to resuspent the cells in the media the resuspended cells would then be introduced to a tissue culture flask of a selected size such as the  cm tissue culture flask and the cells are grown in the media under the controlled environment of an incubator using the adapter of the present invention the thawed cell line pellet may be transferred directly into a flask containing growth media subsequent centrifuge rotation to pellet the cells and removal of a supernatant would occur in the tissue culture flask as would resuspension of the pellet itself into a media because a transfer step is eliminated the risk of contamination is lowered and less experimentalist time is required example  passing and refeeding of cells  the cell culture flask may be used to grow adherent cell culture or suspension cell cultures such as from established cell lines or from primary cells derived from blood body fluids tissues or organs the cell line originate from a frozen cell stock or from primary cells needed to be resupplied with fresh nutrient media after a period of growth in the flask in current protocols the cells such as in the suspended cell culture or the detached cells from the adherent cell culture would be transferred to a conical tube or other similar labware and spun to pellet the cells the supernatant would then be removed and additional culture media added to the tube the cells would then be resuspended and transferred to cell culture flasks for continuing growth or be divided into a number of flasks for additional growth in using the present invention such transfer of cells to conical tubes may no longer be necessary over the course of cell maintenance or expansion growth the number of transfers between flasks and tubes eliminated by the use of the present adapter is quite significant each transfer bears the risk of contamination of the cell line the present invention obviates the need for such transfers reducing the risk of cellline contamination given that such passing and refeeding steps may occur a number of times in the growth of cell cultures the use of the present invention allows savings of time and cost at each of these repeated steps example  harvesting of cells  finally the harvesting of cells of analysis previously may require transferring of the cells and media from a flask in which the cells were growing to a conical tube as before the cells would be subjected to centrifugal force to pellet the cells the media is removed the cells are resuspended in the conical tube adjusted to the appropriate concentration and subsequently transferred to be used for various end analysis alternatively the concentrated cells may be transferred to vials or other storage containers for freezing and future reuse the present adapter can eliminate the use of the conical tubes instead allowing the centrifugation of cells to occur in the original tissue culture flask  a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a number of alternatives are possible using the present device for example the illustrations detail the use of cell culture flasks for use with the present adapter however a number of different sample container or microfluidic devices could be used with variations of the present adapter such an adapter would be able to support delicate sides of such a container or device or allow simplified insertion and extraction of the container or device from the adapter  the adapter may be made of polyurethane or other similar material a  durometer plastic may be used to provide a resilient material for the adapter the adapter in the examples was manufactured as a single piece this adapter may be produced by molding or extruding or other manufacturing means however the present invention includes adapters made of any material manufactured in any manner which include the specified adapter features  the adapter is shown in embodiments of figs  that have one or two pockets however additional pockets may be used in addition each pocket was illustrated as having a single slit on each side in some embodiments two or more slits could be used the slit may be aligned with the seam groove or the seam groove may not be aligned some adapters may not include slits and instead simply have one of the following features inner pocket support ribs recesses to accommodate legs or other sample container protrusions or handles and adapter compression features to aid in extraction of the adapter from a rotor device  in some applications it may be advantageous to enclose the sample container to prevent the escape of aerosol droplets or volatized compounds the rotor bucket may include a cover for this purpose such as the aeroseal™ cover for buckets sold by beckman coulter fullerton calif alternatively the adapter may include a cover that encloses the tops of containers inserted into the adapter  the present examples shown in figs  illustrate embodiments of the present invention that include one or more slits dividing sections of the adapter the inventors also envision two part adapters as an alternative means for allowing simplified extraction of the sample container from the adapter the adapter sections could then be fit to receive one or more sample containers features on the adapter such as pins and holes or a tongue and groove system could allow the sections of the adapter to fit together such an adapter would retain the adapter structure such as structure to accommodate raised features on the exterior surface of the sample container structure to support the walls of the sample container indicia to indicate the proper insertion direction of the container andor adapter structure to allow simplified extraction of the container from a recess into which the container is inserted such features could also be part of an adapter that does not have a slit and instead simply has one or more pockets to hold a sample container if the sample container does not have any raised features on the sides of the container an adapter without a slit could be used while still allowing for maintenance of the integrity of the sample separation  in the embodiments shown in figs  the slit present was illustrated as on the sides of the adapter with the hinge on the bottom however a hinge on one side of the adapter with a slit on one side and on the bottom of the adapter is also envisioned as an embodiment of the present invention  in the embodiments shown in figs  multiple sample containers are shown in parallel orientation this has the advantage of subjecting the sample containers to similar hydraulic forces during a sample separation alternative sample container configurations are possible for example fig  illustrates a top view of an alternative layout for samples containers in an adapter in this embodiment each sample container pocket may include two slits extending from corners of the pocket to the exterior walls of the adapter such slits would run from the top of the adapter to a midpoint in the bottom of the pocket to allow each pocket to divide into two sections allowing efficient extraction of the sample container alternatively as described above the pockets could be constructed without slits  the present invention should be adaptable to either fixed angle or “swinging” type rotors in addition the adapter could form a part of the rotor held device with the rotor opening at a mechanical hinge to allow insertion of a sample container  the features of the stated embodiments may be combined in various manners and still be within the inventors understanding of the present invention   previous patent composite informational item forming machine and methodnext patent glass beads and uses
