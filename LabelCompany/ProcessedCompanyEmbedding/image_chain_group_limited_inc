amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years these accounts and estimates include but are not limited to the estimation on useful lives of property plant and equipment actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments   for certain of the company’s financial instruments including cash and equivalents accounts and other receivables accounts and other payables accrued liabilities and shortterm debt the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the company asc topic  “financial instruments” defines fair value and establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets         ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument         ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement   the company analyzes all

impairment losses to be recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the longlived assets   the longlived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets   if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell during the reporting periods there was no

does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within icgl have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over

amounts in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the longlived assets   the longlived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets   if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell during the reporting periods there was no impairment loss     f

for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets          ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument          ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement     f        image chain group limited inc notes to consolidated financial statements   the company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and

business are included in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition acquisitionrelated costs including conversion and restructuring charges are expensed as incurred   w recent accounting pronouncements   on january   the fasb issued asu no  “financial instruments—overall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which amends the guidance in us gaap on the classification and measurement of financial instruments although the asu retains many current requirements it significantly revises an entity’s accounting related to  the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and  the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value the asu also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments the new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december     on february   the fasb issued asu no  “leases topic ” its new standard on accounting for leases asu  introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet the new standard also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in asc  the fasb’s new revenue recognition standard eg those related to evaluating when profit can be recognized     f        image chain group limited inc notes to consolidated financial statements   furthermore the asu addresses other concerns related to the current leases model for example the asu eliminates the requirement in current us gaap for an entity to use brightline tests in determining lease classification the standard also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure the new model represents a wholesale change to lease accounting as a result entities will face significant implementation challenges during the transition period and beyond such as those related to     ● applying judgment and estimating   ● managing the complexities of data collection storage and maintenance   ● enhancing information technology systems to ensure their ability to perform the calculations necessary for compliance with reporting requirements   ● refining internal controls and other business processes related to leases   ● determining whether debt covenants are likely to be affected and if so working with lenders to avoid violations   ● addressing any income tax implications   the new guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after december   eg calendar periods beginning on january   and interim periods therein   on march   the fasb issued asu no  “investments—equity method and joint ventures topic  simplifying the transition to the equity method of accounting” which simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence consequently when an investment qualifies for the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and the equity method would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee the asu further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income related to an availableforsale security that becomes eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which the investment qualifies for the equity method   the guidance in the asu is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for all entities entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the asu’s effective date additional transition disclosures are not required upon adoption   on march   the fasb issued asu no  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” which amends the principalversusagent implementation guidance and illustrations in the board’s new revenue standard asu  the fasb issued the asu in response to concerns identified by stakeholders including those related to  determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard’s principalversusagent guidance and  applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard’s control principle among other things the asu clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer as defined in the asu a specified good or service is “a distinct good or service or a distinct bundle of goods or services to be provided to the customer” therefore for contracts involving more than one specified good or service the entity may be the principal for one or more specified goods or services and the agent for others   the asu has the same effective date as the new revenue standard as amended by the oneyear deferral and the early adoption provisions in asu  in addition entities are required to adopt the asu by using the same transition method they used to adopt the new revenue standard     f        image chain group limited inc notes to consolidated financial statements   on march   the fasb issued asu no  “compensation—stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee sharebased payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities including the accounting for income taxes forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements as well as classification in the statement of cash flows the asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those annual reporting periods   on august   the fasb issued asu no  “statement of cash flows topic ” stakeholders indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under topic  statement of cash flows and other topics this update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice the amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period as a result the company has elected to early adopt this update prospectively as of december   and prior periods retrospective adjustments have not been applied   as of december   except for the above there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have a material effect on the company’s financial statements   x contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantee would be disclosed    going concern uncertainties   these financial statements have been prepared assuming that company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future   as of december   and  restated the company had accumulated deficits of  and  due to the substantial losses incurred in operations that have been discontinued in  there was substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as going concern at december   and management’s previous plan to support the company’s operations and maintain its business strategy by raising additional funds through public and private offerings or loans from related parties or to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation was unsuccessful     f        image chain group limited inc notes to consolidated financial statements   if the company does not raise additional money via public or private offerings or related party loans the company may be unable to continue as going concern additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term   the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted to the expected recoverable amounts management believes no further adjustments for recoverability and classification of assets or liabilities are necessary    income tax   the company is subject to us income taxes   the company’s subsidiary fortune delight holdings

follows other receivable accrued liabilities sales selling general and administrative expenses were previously recorded as    and  but have been adjusted to be    and  respectively accumulated deficit was increased by  the reason for the adjustment is that the company recorded the funds received by a third party on the company’s behalf and related liability for the commissions payable related to the sale of its shares the funds were not received by the company but instead paid to the managers of the company’s prior prc subsidiaries upon discovery of this error management has determined that the gross amount of these funds should be netted against commission expenses accrued as liabilities and the expected net proceeds that were received by the managers of the prc subsidiaries are no longer recoverable and should be written to the company’s results of operations in  the impact of the company’s loss per share was an additional loss of     loss on subscription receivable   the

amounts in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the longlived assets   the longlived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets   if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair

instruments held by the company asc topic  “financial instruments” defines fair value and establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets         ● level  inputs to the

disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern asu  applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after december   with early adoption permitted the company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements                image chain group limited inc notes to consolidated financial statements   in november  fasb issued accounting standards update no  derivatives and hedging topic  determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task forcethe amendments permit the use of

the new requirements in fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   all other types of entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods beginning after december   the company does not expect the adoption of asu  to have material impact on the company’s financial statement   in january  the fasb issued asu no  “income statement—extraordinary and unusual items subtopic ”this update eliminates from gaap the concept of extraordinary items subtopic  income statement—extraordinary and unusual items required that an entity separately classify present and disclose extraordinary events and transactions presently an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item paragraph  contains the following criteria that must both be met for extraordinary classification      unusual nature the underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity taking into account the environment in which the entity operates          infrequency of occurrence the underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future taking into account the environment in which the entity operates   if an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement net of tax after income from continuing operations the entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earningspershare data applicable to the extraordinary item   the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   a reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively a reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption the effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities   in september  the fasb issued asu  the guidance eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments following a business combination the new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment including the impact on prior periods be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified the prior period impact of the adjustment should be either presented separately on the face of the income statement or disclosed in the notes the company is currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements                image chain group limited inc notes to consolidated financial statements     w contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantee would be disclosed    goodwill   goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable assets acquired in a business combination in accordance with fasb asc topic  “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill is no longer subject to amortization rather

united states requires our management to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements including the notes thereto and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies if any we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements including the following   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents trade receivables prepaid expenses payables and accrued expenses fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision we consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements to approximate fair value due to their shortterm nature   property and equipment   property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided for using straightline methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets usually three to seven years                valuation of longlived assets   we periodically evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value a writedown would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value we do not believe that there has been any impairment to longlived assets as of september   and    recent accounting pronouncements   see “recent accounting pronouncements” in note  of notes to the financial statements   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   the company is currently developing a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   pursuant to rule ab under the exchange act the company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined under rule ae under the exchange act as of the quarter ended september   based upon that evaluation the company’s chief executive officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective however the company is taking steps to remediate the deficiency as noted above the company is currently developing a set of disclosure controls and procedures and considering engaging outside service providers to provide expertise on this matter   changes in internal control over financial reporting   we will begin to regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment changes may include such activities as implementing new more efficient systems consolidating activities migrating processes and consulting with outside experts    there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended september   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting    inherent limitations over internal controls   icgl’s management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within icgl have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures                part ii other information   item
