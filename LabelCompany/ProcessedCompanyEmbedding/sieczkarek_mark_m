clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the unmet therapeutic needs of the global topical antiinfective market with its aganocide compounds led by auriclosene auriclosene is a new chemical entity invented by novabay that has a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria viruses and fungi aganocide compounds are based on the human body’s natural immune system and the molecules involved in combating infections bacterial resistance to aganocides is highly unlikely as demonstrated in published studies once pathogens penetrate the body’s primary defense the next line of defense is provided by the white blood cells novabay has focused on understanding these molecules generated by the white blood cells and finding ways by chemical modification to allow them to be developed as therapeutic products with the potential to treat a wide range of local nonsystemic infections novabay believes that aganocides will help reduce the rise of antibiotic resistance as they begin to supplant the usage of classic topical antibiotics forwardlooking statements this release contains forwardlooking statements and opinions which are based upon management’s current expectations
