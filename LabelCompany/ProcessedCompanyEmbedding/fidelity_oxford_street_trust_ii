of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgovsearchsearchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  each trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of massachusetts or delaware as applicable each trust is registered under the act as an openend management investment company fmr co sai or another fmr entity serves as investment adviser or subadviser to each of the funds fmr co and sai are investment advisers registered under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” any investment adviser to the funds will be registered under the advisers act  the prior order permits the funds to participate in a credit facility administered by fmr the “ifl program” the ifl program enables the funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels the ifl program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the funds and enhance the lending funds ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their shortterm balances the prior order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the ifl program the “ifl rate” be based on the average of a the higher of the overnight time deposit rate the “otd rate” and the funds current overnight repurchase agreement rate the “ficash rate”  and b a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the funds “benchmark rate” the board of trustees each a “fund board” and collectively the “fund boards” of each fund including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent trustees” establishes the benchmark rate and reviews no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate the benchmark rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the federal funds rate over the previous  days  applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary therefore applicants seek to amend the prior order to eliminate the use of the otd rate in the ifl rate calculation provided in conditions  and  “rate conditions” applicants also request an exemption from section a of the act applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person directly or indirectly if that person controls or is under common control with that company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds applicants state that each fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other funds and therefore an affiliated person of those funds  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  section f of the act prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank if immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting an exemption from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting an exemption from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements the requested order would amend the rate conditions in the prior order and grant applicants an exemption from section a of the act  as noted previously applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary applicants state further that the ifl rate as amended would make it more likely that lending funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the ifl program if the ifl rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate applicants state that the rate conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity  applicants also state that the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions will not involve any potential that one fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another fund applicants state that under the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions rates will be set under a preestablished formula approved by the fund boards applicants state that all funds participating in the ifl program as revised by the rate conditions on any given day will receive the same interest rate  applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the rate conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the act and meet the standards set forth in sections c dj b and d of the act and rule d under the act applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the rate conditions would be reasonable and fair would not involve overreaching and would be consistent with the investment policies of the funds and with the general purposes of the act applicants submit further that each funds participation in the ifl program would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be on a basis which is no different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the ifl rate to be charged to the funds under the ifl program will be the average of a the ficash rate and b the benchmark rate  on each business day the cash management services department “cash management department” of fidelity service company inc will compare the ifl rate calculated as provided in condition  with the ficash rate that day and all shortterm borrowing rates quoted to any of the funds by any bank with which any fund has a loan agreement at least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any fund borrows through the ifl program prior to such borrowing the cash management department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the ifl rate is more favorable to the lending fund than the ficash rate and more favorable to the borrowing fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate  if a fund has outstanding borrowings any interfund loans to the fund i will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan ii will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral iii will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan and in any event not over seven days and iv will provide that if an event of default by the fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the fund that event of default will automatically without need for action or notice by the lending fund constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund loan agreement entitling the lending fund to call the loan and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing fund  a fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the ifl program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total  or less of its total assets provided that if the fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender including but not limited to another fund the funds interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral if a funds total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than  of its total assets the fund may borrow through the ifl program only on a secured basis a fund could not borrow through the ifl program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than  of its total assets  before any fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may through additional borrowings cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed  of its total assets the fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan if the total outstanding borrowings of a fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed  of its total assets for any other reason such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions the fund will within one business day thereafter i repay all its outstanding interfund loans ii reduce its outstanding indebtedness to  or less of its total assets or iii secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a funds total outstanding borrowings exceed  is repaid or the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets the fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan  no fund may lend to another fund through the ifl program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the ifl program to exceed  of the lending funds current net assets at the time of the loan  a funds interfund loans to any one fund shall not exceed  of the lending funds net assets  the duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold but in no event more than seven days loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition  each interfund loan may be called on one business days notice by a lending fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing fund  a funds participation in the ifl program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents no fund may borrow through the ifl program unless the fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that certain funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose  the cash management department will calculate total fund borrowing and lending demand through the ifl program and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the funds without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the funds the cash management department will not solicit cash for the ifl program from any fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in ficash or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by fmr co or another fmr entity or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the funds  fmr will monitor the ifl rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the fund boards concerning the participation of the funds in the ifl program and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the ifl program  each fund board including a majority of the independent trustees will a review no less frequently than quarterly each funds participation in the ifl program during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions b establish the benchmark rate formula used to determine the interest rate on interfund loans and review no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate formula and c review no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of each funds participation in the ifl program  in the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the
