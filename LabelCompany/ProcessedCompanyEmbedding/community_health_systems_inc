center   alessandro blvd moreno valley   serving underinsured and uninsured individuals such as the homeless indigent and working poor community health systems offers individuals the opportunity to receive the health care they need on a slidingscale and in a supportive comfortable environment established from the roots of bloomington community health center in bloomington community health systems inc chsi has grown with community health centers in the counties of riverside san bernardino and san diego the mission of chsi is not to compete with other clinics that provide healthcare services but to serve the indigent population who other doctors cannot see because of financial constraints and to meet these patients’ healthcare needs mcgruff the crime dog educating chsi pediatric patients about staying safe through games puzzles and coloring booksin  jack e johns the chief executive officer of chsi a retired military man with a career in military medicine realized he missed working directly with patients johns began working with community clinics and is now dedicated to the work of chsi to date there have been  patient visits  of which were uninsured individuals in all five chsi clinics combined three of which are in riverside county johns notes that the centers in riverside county are all relatively new stateoftheart facilities and their focus is more than just family medicine “we have teen clinics in three of the sites for teens at risk this is one of the biggest issues in our community right now” says johns working with young pregnant women who are as young as  and  years old chsi is able to offer all services and resources available university community health center   university ave riverside   “by the time we are finished they have essentially a baby shower’s worth of products” says johns “it’s astounding how many girls this age are pregnant” it can be a terrifying time for the girls and the staff not only looks after their prenatal care but also talks to the mother’s parents helps the girls get back in school and helps them with their social needs they also receive dental care and are educated on what their babies need to thrive university community health center giving away backpacks at back to school health fairyouth dentistry is also an important service to the community and the pediatric anesthesia program is an uncommon service “we have children whose teeth are so bad that they are malnourished” says johns “they can’t explain to their parents that it’s their teeth they think they have a headache or something is wrong with their face” using anesthesia the children go to sleep in their parents arms and awaken with their dental care attended to and without the stress “sometimes the next time we see these young patients they’ve gained five pounds” says johns children who aren’t in school may also have vision problems that adults don’t recognize “we do try to push them over to the optometrist to get them seen” says johns “we find out that the kids can’t see in front of them let alone see the stars in the sky and when they suddenly can it seems like a miracle to them” magnolia community health center   magnolia ave riverside   finding funding to provide services is always a challenge the youth grantmakers fund through the community foundation has supported biweekly informational classes at the magnolia community health center but chsi is always on the lookout for further funding “a community clinic that is really accomplishing its mission will always have a cash flow problem” says johns “the very idea is that if we start making more money we give more services as soon as we start feeling more comfortable we should be delivering more services” moreno valley family health center child health  disability prevention program chdp delivers periodic health assessments and services to low income children and youthgoverned by a board of members made up by the community johns notes that chsi is really about serving the community where they are based “having a local volunteer board helps us maintain the programs that are needed the most within the community” says johns chsi also hopes that more of the community will learn about the services available to them at their clinics as they feel they are often an unknown resource johns the board and the staff feel that the struggles of meeting community needs are worth the end results “the days when i get discouraged and think it’s hopeless and we can’t do it i sit in the waiting room and watch the patients and the kids in the waiting room” says johns “then i get reenergized and start all over again” to find out more about community health systems inc their services and how to support them you can visit wwwchsicaorg or call
