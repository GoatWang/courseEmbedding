under the symbol wbmd on the nasdaq global select market our business we generate revenue from the advertising and sponsorship services of the webmd health network and related operations from the

continuing medical education which we refer to as cme credit and communicate with peers we do not charge any usage membership or download fees for access to the websites and mobile apps included in the webmd health network we generate revenue from the webmd health network primarily through the sale of various types of advertising and sponsorship programs to our clients which include pharmaceutical biotechnology and medical device companies hospitals clinics and other healthcare services companies health insurance providers consumer products companies whose products or services relate to health wellness diet fitness lifestyle safety and illness prevention and various other businesses organizations and governmental entities advertisers and sponsors use our services to reach educate and inform target audiences of consumers physicians and other healthcare professionals we also generate revenue from advertising sold in webmd magazine a consumer magazine distributed to

and follow selfpaced personal action plans we generate health services revenue from employer and health plan subscriptions to our webmd health services platform either directly or through distributor relationships in addition clients are charged on a per participant basis for our health and wellness coaching programs information services we generate revenue from the sale of certain information products and services on a standalone basis using deidentified data that we license from a small number of thirdparty data sources of which the principal source is a license from change healthcare to hlth corporation or hlth our former parent company as the successor to hlth this license provides us the rights to certain deidentified data from change healthcare through early february  for use in the development and commercialization of various information products and services customers for these information services include data services informatics and consulting companies our revenue from the products and services that utilize data under the current change healthcare license is highly profitable and is reported net of the royalties and commissions that we pay to change healthcare or others we do not expect that the current license agreement with change healthcare will continue after february  and expect that if such agreement is replaced with new thirdparty data sources the terms of any such replacement license would not be as favorable to us as those in the current agreement discussions around extending our agreement with change healthcare have stalled in addition as described in note  to the consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report change healthcare filed a lawsuit in april  challenging webmds rights under the license agreement to continue to use the data delivered to webmd during the term of the agreement after the agreements termination in early february  we are exploring other sources of thirdparty data and uses of our first party data to generate additional revenue streams but we are early in that process accordingly we expect that the sales of and the profits generated by our information services business will be materially adversely affected by the termination in early february  of our license agreement with change healthcare table of contents background information on certain trends and developments affecting our business key trends and developments affecting the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing and our ability to generate revenue from those services include the following online marketing and education spending for healthcare products pharmaceutical biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them however only a small portion is currently spent on online services we believe that these companies which represented approximately  of our advertising and sponsorship revenue in  are aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health clinical and productrelated information to consumers and physicians in addition in an effort to improve operating efficiencies some pharmaceutical companies have been reducing their field sales forces in the past several years  we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide advertising solutions for pharmaceutical products that are currently being marketed as well as those in the pipeline for food and drug administration fda approval many of these pharmaceutical products are expensive therapies that treat complex conditions affecting relatively small patient populations for which we believe that our online services provide an efficient way to reach target audiences  however notwithstanding our general expectation for increased future demand we cannot predict the extent or the pace of any shift by pharmaceutical biotechnology and medical device companies of their marketing expenditures to online services or to what extent they will choose webmd to provide such services in addition some of our pharmaceutical company customers have experienced patent expirations for certain of their products in the past several years and some are expected to experience patent expirations over the next several years in the pharmaceutical industry patent expirations allow for competition from lowerpriced generic versions of the patented drugs and generally result in the termination of marketing efforts for the drug and in certain instances have resulted in reductions in the overall online advertising budgets for some of our customers trends affecting the pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political legislative regulatory and other influences the expectations of pharmaceutical companies regarding pending or potential industry developments may affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to services of the types we provide since  there has been increasing scrutiny regarding pricing and profitability for pharmaceutical products which could lead to additional regulation of such pricing or other changes in how those products are distributed and the roles played by various industry participants in that distribution including significant changes in how drugs are procured for governmentfunded programs such as medicare and medicaid our pharmaceutical company customers are assessing the implications of potential changes for their businesses and we believe that some may in light of the uncertainty regarding the nature and timing of any such changes be delaying or deferring deployment of their marketing budgets we cannot predict the effect that any resulting changes may have on the marketing plans of our customers in future periods or their future use of our services for additional discussion see healthcare reform below healthcare reform political economic regulatory and enforcement influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the us to fundamental changes there have been and we expect there will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact the various healthcare entities with which we do business in particular we anticipate that the us executive branch us congress state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs particularly given the ongoing scrutiny regarding healthcare pricing in the us generally and prescription drug pricing specifically such policies could limit the prices our advertisers and sponsors charge for their healthcarerelated products or services limit the commercial opportunities of our advertisers and sponsors and negatively impact revenues collected by our advertisers and sponsors however the nature and timing of any table of contents one law with a significant impact on the healthcare industry is the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of  which we refer to as the affordable care act the affordable care act made extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the us while we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects as a direct result of the application of the affordable care act as currently enacted or as it may be amended to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts will be on webmds business through its effects on other healthcare industry participants including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of the webmd health network and employers and health plans that license our webmd health services platform healthcare industry participants may respond to uncertainties created by the potential statutory and regulatory changes to the affordable care act by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions including expenditures for our services factors that may cause our advertising and sponsorship revenue to vary from quarter to quarter our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors many of which are outside our control including economic and regulatory conditions generally and those specifically affecting healthcare industry participants as well as the following  the majority of our advertising and sponsorship commitments are for terms of approximately four to twelve months we have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship commitments  the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contractual commitment with the advertiser or sponsor for that program as well as the additional time period before our services are delivered may be longer than expected especially for mediumsized and larger contracts and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals including internal approvals relating to compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing of healthcare products we have experienced from time to time in the past a lengthening of this internal review process by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which has resulted in delays in contracting as well as delays in recognizing expected revenue under executed contracts and we cannot predict whether similar delays may occur in future periods additional factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors or receipt of revenue under such contracts include the timing of fda approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products the timing of fda approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of products from the market consolidation of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries the timing of rollouts of new or enhanced services for the webmd health network seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals other factors affecting the demand for our advertising and sponsorship services advertiser and sponsor clients of the webmd health network also include companies that provide overthecounter drugs and other healthcare products food and beverages beauty products and other consumer products particularly for products and services that relate to health wellness diet fitness lifestyle safety and illness prevention as well as clients such as retailers pharmacies hospitals health insurance companies table of contents considerations regarding traffic to the webmd health network traffic to medscape properties from physicians worldwide averaged approximately  million physician sessions per month in first quarter of  an increase of approximately  over the prior year period physicians generally come directly to medscape properties rather than through search during the first quarter of  an average of approximately  us physicians were active on medscape monthly we also reach a total of approximately  million other healthcare professionals in the us annually and a total of approximately  million physicians outside the us annually according to comscore the webmd health network reached an average of approximately  million users per month combining desktop and mobile users on a deduplicated basis in the first quarter of  which was approximately the same as in the prior year period in recent quarters we have seen declines in the number of search referrals we have received from google and this has impacted the aggregate traffic to our consumer sites however we have offset much of the decline with growth in direct sources of traffic overall traffic to the webmd health network is not correlated to our advertising and sponsorship revenue with respect to our websites for consumers we create content on specific topics and program various portions to build and maintain traffic in the areas most important to our advertising and sponsorship clients in addition while the total medscape audience is small compared to the total audience of the webmd health network medscape websites and mobile apps contributed approximately  of our advertising and sponsorship revenue in recent periods because of the high value our clients place on being able to reach the medscape audience of physicians and other healthcare professionals or to reach targeted portions of that medscape audience social media and video initiatives given the increasing prominence of social networks as important platforms for finding and consuming content webmd is working to enable users to more easily discover share and interact with content from webmd not just on our own websites but also in other online locations some of our initiatives are directed toward the creation of new content offerings that are tailored for specific social networks and platforms our strategy to extend our content and brand beyond the webmd health network will in some cases allow us to drive people back to webmds sites where we can monetize that traffic as we do today in other cases we may be able to take advantage of new monetization opportunities as we engage with users outside of webmds sites another key aspect of these initiatives is to create video content that is both highly engaging and easily sharable across social networks we are also continuing to develop longerform video offerings such as our multiepisode clinical series medscape tv which utilizes nationally recognized thought leaders to discuss important topics in medicine for a physician audience trends affecting our services for employers and health plans in response to increasing healthcare costs public and private sector employers and health plans have been changing benefit plan designs to increase deductibles copayments and other outofpocket costs and taking other steps to motivate employees and plan participants to live healthier lives and use healthcare in a costeffective manner in connection with shifting greater responsibility for healthcare costs to employees and plan participants employers and health plans are making available more health and benefits information and decision support applications to help their employees and plan participants make informed decisions about table of contents international physicians and healthcare professionals from around the world access our content in english through medscape in addition we publish spanish french portuguese and german language editions of medscape through which healthcare professionals can access our content in those languages we have also entered into collaborations with companies having expertise in a specific country or region to extend our reach we plan to continue to pursue opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the united states particularly with respect to our healthcare professionals audience in certain markets outside the united states we expect to accomplish this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region while in other such markets we expect to rely primarily on our own internal resources other initiatives we are pursuing and intend to continue to identify new business opportunities where our consumer and physician audiences and our resources can be leveraged to develop additional products and services we may pursue initiatives to create new or enhanced revenue streams or alternatively to increase audience engagement even when we have not identified any potential related revenue stream new business initiatives present risks and challenges that may be different from the ones we have faced in the past in addition later events may alter the risks that were evaluated at the time decisions are made on specific initiatives failure to effectively identify and assess new business initiatives and to successfully implement them may adversely affect our company and its prospects the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers providers and consumers are very complicated in addition the internet and the market for online and mobile services are relatively new and still evolving accordingly there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our business from our responses to those trends will be achieved in addition the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends but the trends may also attract additional competitors background information on certain significant developments and transactions exploration of strategic alternatives on february   we announced that our board of directors working together with our management team and legal and financial advisors had commenced a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value these alternatives could include among other things the sale of part or all of our company a merger with another party other types of strategic transactions or continuing to execute on webmds business plan as of the date of this quarterly report that process is ongoing and our board has not set a specific date for its completion there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction as described under convertible notes below webmd has outstanding convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of  billion the effect on the convertible notes of any potential transaction relating to the exploration of strategic alternatives would depend on the specific timing structure and terms of such transaction including among other things the type and amount of any consideration received and may also depend on table of contents    may   c
