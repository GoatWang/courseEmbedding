ended june   exposure to high yield contributed to performance due to a combination of strong fundamentals a good earnings season continued low default rates and supportive technicals investmentgrade debt helped results as the sector posted strong performance after a strong earnings season technicals were favorable due to continued foreign investor demand emerging market debt also contributed partly due to the attractive carry of selective hardlocal currency sovereign bonds the funds government rates exposure detracted as our core view of higher yields in developed markets was challenged particularly in the beginning of the quarter our emerging markets foreign exchange exposure detracted mainly due to political volatility in brazil and underperformance of the russian ruble looking ahead we maintain our expectations that global growth momentum will continue and central bank accommodation will remain supportive for global risk assets in the near term we have a negative view on us duration as we expect a more hawkish fed and a rebound in us growth to drive treasury yields higher by yearend to the  range we are still constructive on spread sectors through investmentgrade and highyield corporates due to positive technicals and credit fundamentals highyield default rates are low and spreads could provide a modest cushion in an environment of rising rates we particularly believe that european bank capital alternative tier  offers improving fundamentals and benefits from continued buying from the ecb we continue to be selective on emerging markets as we are
