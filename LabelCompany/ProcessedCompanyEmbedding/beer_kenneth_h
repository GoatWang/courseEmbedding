contact dermatitis as well as some of the most common dermatologic issues such as acne and rosacea our offices provide treatments that involve systemic therapy when appropriate and customized topical treatment regimens as needed our interest in general dermatology spans the spectrum of dermatology from hair loss to problems with nails as specialists who focus on the wellness of your skin hair and nails we believe that proper dermatologic care is essential psoriasis affects about  million people in the us the disease is most commonly associated with red scaly skin on the knees and elbows but may also involve the scalp body face and nails for many patients suffering from this disease arthritis andor gastrointestinal problems may also impair their quality of life there are many treatments for psoriasis and at beer dermatology we use combinations of topical treatments moisturizers lifestyle management light therapy and biologic modifiers to help our patients eczema is another skin disease that we treat eczema is frequently associated with red scaly patches of skin behind the knees in the elbows and on the sides of the neck patients with eczema may get infected with bacteria that impair their ability to heal when needed treatments with antibiotics may help patients clear for some of our patients the use of ultraviolet lights helps to maintain their skin and allows them to lead normal lives for others changes in diet and products used can make a difference we formulate treatment plans that include the use of biologic modifiers when needed to help improve quality of life for our patients with eczema we also try to identify ingredients that may cause flares and work with allergists to identify contact allergens another facet of our practice is skin cancer detection and treatment for most patients an annual skin examination is recommended for some patients including those with a history of skin cancer or a family history of skin cancer including melanoma more frequent skin evaluations are recommended if you have a mole that is changing in size shape or color or that has become itchy or asymmetric it should be evaluated skin cancers are the most common types of cancers diagnosed in the us fortunately when detected early they are usually treatable many of our patients have a history of increased sun exposure during their youth they are especially susceptible to skin cancers and should be vigilant the most common skin cancer is known as a basal cell carcinoma this type of cancer is frequently a pearly pink or white bump that can bleed or that simply does not heal basal cell carcinoma is usually treated with surgery performed in the office when they occur on the face the treatment of choice is known as mohs surgery see below squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer and it usually has the appearance of a scaly pink or red bump that does not heal they can be itchy and may also bleed these types of skin cancer can occasionally go to other parts of the body and are treated surgically melanoma is the most serious of the common skin cancers these lesions usually begin as black or brown spots that are uneven in size and color rarely a melanoma will lack pigment and simply appear as a pink bump that is growing or itching treatment for early melanomas is usually surgical and for early lesions this surgery is performed in a dermatologist’s office thicker or more advanced lesions may be accompanied by removal of lymph nodes and this is usually done by a general surgeon surgical dermatology we offer expertise in all aspects of surgical dermatology including removal of skin cancers mohs skin cancer surgery removal of benign skin growths and a range of laser treatments we also provide skin cancer screening examinations and recommend that these be performed at least once a year if you have fair skin andor a history of increased sun exposure especially as a young child we recommend that you do skin examinations every four to six months among the skin growths that we treat in our surgical practice are cysts skin tags warts benign skin growths such as seborrheic keratosis skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma precancerous skin growths known as actinic keratosis are very common and are treated with cryosurgery nitrogen lasers photodynamic therapy or topical treatments we also have experience with rare skin cancers and have published articles on their management surgical dermatology evolves continuously with newer techniques and materials used to improve outcomes if you are considering having something removed from your skin please feel free to ask us about your procedure concierge dermatology no aspect of medicine has been immune to changes imposed by managed care medicare or other entities these changes affect your healthcare for patients interested in expedited appointments expanded consultations or discussions about wellness or those who require extra attention for coordination of care we offer a limited number of concierge dermatology opportunities cosmetic dermatology injectables fillers and botulinum toxins botulinum toxins we offer a range of advanced cosmetic procedures which are individualized to treat your specific needs these include injections of botulinum toxins purified proteins known as botox dysport and xeomin as well as fillers botulinum toxins are used to relax muscles in various parts of the face botox is approved for the treatment of wrinkles around the eyes crow’s feet and frown lines glabella dysport and xeomin are approved for use in the frown lines these are among the most researched molecules in the world when used by an experienced injector in the proper dose they can provide dramatic results and are safe and effective these products are all purified proteins that have subtle differences so although none is the “best” they are like coke and pepsi and different people choose different products when getting injections of these products the dose and integrity of the formulation are critical in our practice we purchase them directly from the manufacturer in addition we use doses that will provide superior results and duration botox has been used for more than  years and its indications include treatment of cosmetic wrinkles as well as more medical indications such as muscle spasms headaches and a range of other applications in dermatology it is most used to treat the wrinkles between the eyes glabella or frown lines as well as the lines around the eyes crow’s feet the dose required to treat each of these areas differs based on the muscle mass of the area being treated in general people with a lot of muscle mass will require more material than those with less mass they also tend to require more frequent injections of material when considering injections with botox price should not be your only consideration focus on the integrity of the practice and the skill of the injector in our practice we purchase products directly from the manufacturer fillers fillers may be used to “sculpt” the face and lift it while also being able to fill in lines and wrinkles dr beer has been involved in the clinical development of many of these products and he continues to teach advanced techniques in their use in addition to these products sculptra is used to add volume by stimulating collagen production this injection may be combined with other products depending on the products that are used at beer dermatology we use hyaluronic acid fillers as well as those made from calcium hydroxylapatite among the fillers utilized in our practice are juvéderm voluma restylane l restylane lyft restylane refyne juvéderm ultra plus juvéderm vollure juvéderm volbella restylane defyne restylane silk and radiesse all of these come with local anesthetic lidocaine mixed in dr beer and dr davidson have been injecting these products and dr beer was an investigator and training physician for several of them he is considered an “expert injector” because of his advanced skills while there is no one product that is the best each has its own advantages and can be used to achieve a desired result in a particular area each of the fillers has different physical properties that lend themselves to specific indications for instance voluma restylane lyft and radiesse are thicker products that may be used to restore lost volume and fill in areas that have lost volume these thicker products are also used to lift the face and can be used to help restore the face to a more youthful appearance smoother thinner products such as restylane refyne and juvéderm are best used for treating lines and wrinkles and can also be helpful in restoring the corners of the mouth to a more youthful position restylane silk belotero and juvéderm volbella may be used to replace lost volume in the lips they can also help to treat the fine lines around the lips for some patients combinations of these products are used to provide the personalized results that allow our patients to look refreshed but not artificial in general injections are performed at intervals of between six to  months common adverse events associated with these injections include bruising and swelling in and around the injection sites but these tend to be temporary in nature sculptra is a molecule that is injected into the skin to stimulate collagen when used correctly it can restore the volume lost with time advantages of this product include the fact that it stimulates you to make your own collagen however it is a gradual process that can involve multiple injections over the span of a few months this treatment has been around for about ten years and during that time its use has evolved considerably while only approved for injections into the face it is being used to stimulate collagen growth in many areas of the body in an “off label” nonapproved by the fda manner sculptra is not appropriate for some areas of the face including the lips and tear troughs eyelid region in some patients its use has been associated with the formation of small lumps and bumps under the skin kybella dr beer is an expert injector with kybella and was one of the few people in the us to participate in clinical trials that led to its fda approval when injected under the chin it dissolves the fat that can accumulate there kybella treatments require a few visits to the office after each treatment it is common to have swelling that can last for about a week the amount of swelling and degree of inflammation depend on the amount of fat that is present as well as the amount of kybella injected in general two to four treatments are used to help decrease the appearance of fat below the chin while it is approved for use under the chin its use in places such as the legs arms shoulders and other areas is considered “off label” by the fda lasers intense pulsed light and radiofrequency beer dermatology is one of the few centers to offer the entire range of lasers and energy devices whether you need to have a minimally invasive procedure or a more intense laser treatment we have the experience and training to help you achieve your goals the fraxel is one of our most popular lasers and it is used to improve the appearance of fine lines and help the texture of the skin after the procedure it is common to be red for a few days this procedure is typically performed as a series of treatments the intense pulsed light treatment is a broad spectrum light source that is absorbed by the pigment of the skin this is used to treat red and brown discoloration typically seen with sun exposure it may also be helpful in treating the redness associated with rosacea and acne this treatment is performed as a series of procedures and it is common to have some mild desquamation afterwards the best results are obtained when this is done several times and then twice a year the isolaz is a laser that is used to treat acne this is done weekly for several weeks and may be combined with medications or performed by itself pulsed dye lasers are used to treat blood vessels scars and other lesions that are pink or red this treatment is typically performed several times with each time helping to decrease the appearance of redness individuals getting this treatment may have rosacea acne birthmarks or scars from trauma burns or surgery cellulite is found in about  percent of women and we are pleased to offer treatments while there is no miracle treatment smoothshapes may help to improve the appearance of cellulite skin tightening is performed using a variety of devices that utilize radiofrequency these devices use energy to heat up the collagen and stimulate it to grow and to tighten multiple sessions are planned as part of any treatment with these devices clinical research beer dermatology also has an active clinical research program in association with the research institute of the southeast we have been doing clinical research for more than ten years during that time we have worked on novel types of treatments for skin cancer better ways to treat acne eczema and psoriasis as well as a wide range of new cosmetic procedures and products dr beer has more than  publications and has participated in more than  clinical trials if you are interested in these please click here clinical research is used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices they require different levels of time commitment

body areas nudity is acceptable email notification to receive an email notification when a beauty expert answers your question please enter your information below allow to use question on site disclosure submit faqs q what is a pulse dye laser used to treat does it hurt what can i expect my skin to look like after treatment what our experts say it’s probably the oldest and most widely used lasers to treat broken blood vessels and scars or anything that’s red including stretch marks and rosacea the only thing i don’t use it for is leg veins it’s approved to treat that but i find that it gives unacceptable white spots afterwards it’s a pretty mild treatment that freezes the skin before the light beam hits it so it’s pretty comfortable q where is botox most commonly injected what our experts say botox is most commonly injected in the area it’s fda approved for frown lines a close second is a combination of injections into the forehead and outside the brow to give a brow lift q how long does botox take after it’s injected to work how long do the effect last what our experts say there are studies that show that within  hourspatients notice an onset but typically we see maximal onset in  to  days also studies using dysport xeomin show a very rapid onset sometimes within  to  days  how long it lasts depends on the dose  if you go to discount place that waters it down it might only last  to  weeks but in general the duration is  to  months and you get longer duration after several visits  patients who have been treated for  to  years break their habit of wrinkling so they don’t need to use it again for  months or more q is collagen still used as a filler what our experts say no q how do you treat “lipstick bleed” lines what our experts say carefully i will do a variety of things sometime i use dilute hyaluronic acid mixed with saline to thin it out and inject using a small needle into the fold  i also use one of botulinum toxins to weaken the pucker muscles or one of my co lasers to etch out the lines q what was evolence what our experts say it was a pigderived collagen product that they are no longer marketing in the united states it was great for filling lines in my opinion it’s a shame it got pulled  q what is the treatment for spider veins does it hurt how many treatments do i need what our experts say if the veins are smaller than a paper clip then i like to inject them if they are bigger then i send the patient to someone for an ultrasound evaluation and an endovenous intervention both of those should be done by someone who does a lot of it either a vascular surgeon an interventional radiologist or a dermatologist with vascular skill i don’t treat anything bigger than a paperclip i don’t do anything i can’t do really well q what does ipl intense pulsed light treat who is the best candidate for this does it hurt what our experts say ipl is great for skin texture brown spots and red spots we use it all day it’s great at reversing the signs of sun damage and aging i have not had anyone who couldn’t tolerate it it feels like a rubber band there is really minimal downtime the skin gets pink with a little flaking for a few days the best candidate would be a fairskinned person who has been exposed to a lot of sun it would be a patient who could come in a few times for treatments and then they will need to use sun protection a skin brightening serum andor retinaa they will proceed gradually and will stick to a program q what is the best treatment for cellulite how long until you see results how long do results last how many treatments do you need what our experts say having decent parents the best treatment for cellulite remains to be seen right now there are two treatments that are good for it smoothshapes laser by cynosure and zeltiq each has its advantages and disadvantages i made the decision to use smoothshapes and i am thrilled with it it’s not a home run but none are it uses two different wavelengths to mobilize and melt fat and then uses suction to increase blood flow it’s totally noninvasive it’s like having a massage the patient has to come in two times a week for four to six weeks we are now trying protocols to decrease the number of visits by having longer treatments i recommend completing the course of treatment and then coming in for an enhancement at six to  months because as women age they continue to make new cellulite after treatment they will see some change in the appearance of the fat i have seen in some people some change in the size of the area treated as well what i tell people is the appearance will change but the measurement may not q how long do fillers last what our experts say prevelle lasts for a few weeks it’s a low concentration a low crosslinked hyaluronic acid radiesse lasts six to nine months sculptra lasts  to  months juvéderm restylane and perlane last six to  months depending on whether an enhancement injection is done after the initial injection q what is sculptra used for what our experts say it’s a collagenstimulating molecule whereas other products are used for lifting sculpting or filling sculptra is used for volume replenishment it causes the body to make collagen and unlike the other fillers it requires a series of injections it’s absolutely wonderful for sunken cheeks fallen temples filling out the jawline and it can bridge the gap between filling lines and facial volume restoration as we agethe face loses volume and everything goes south sculptra can reinflate the face and pull things north by creating collagen you can combine sculptra with other products this really gives someone a renovation without surgical intervention q what is isolaz used to treat what our experts say it’s another type of laser we use for the treatment of acne it’s approved for other things but it’s primarily an acne laser it combines laser energy with a vacuum it’s really great at cleaning out the skin q can a fraxel laser be used on other areas of the body what our experts say it can all be used on other parts of the body we just have to have the experience and adjust the energy q what is the best laser of overall facial rejuvenation what our experts say if you can tolerate the downtime the co activefx or deepfx if they don’t have a few days for downtime than i would use the fraxel it doesn’t go as deep i also like a pixilated laser which erases fragments or dots and allows islands of normal skin to stay the skin gets red but typically there is no downtime q do fillers in the lips stimulate collagen production what our experts say there is a lot of information that fillers in any part of the body stimulate collagen production in some patients not only does it stimulate collagen production but after a few injections the products begin to last longer between these two mechanisms the injections get really great results  q what can i do for thin skin what our experts say use things that prevent more thinning – sun protection and not smoking in addition try to incorporate vitamin c and retin a or retinol in your daily skin care regime q are there any effective lasers out there used to tighten knee area what our experts say there are the trick is to find one that works and then do a series of treatments i like the radiofrequency device and in my office i use the exilis i have not used the ultrasound machines in this area but think they probably help q is it safe to have ipl and yag laser done on the same spots at the same time what our experts say probably not i would use one or the other they have some overlap and i would be cautious about over treating q is it common to have loss of pigment after tca peel what our experts say it sounds like there may be some scarring scars tend not to have pigment in them so this may be part of the problem  it is unusual to see this after a tca peel if it was done at lower strengths so you should check in with the doc that did the peels to make sure everything is ok if you are white in some areas there are a few things that one can try to even them out but sun protection and time help immensely if that does not work bimatoprost topically may help q what type of laser is used for hair removal who is the best candidate what our experts say the alexandrite laser made by candela it works best on those with light skin and dark hair the energy that gets focused is on a primary target which is the hair shaft if the patient has dark skin diode lasers can be used we can also use an alexandrite laser at lower energies no matter what laser is used the darker the skin the harder it is to treat the same holds true for light hair which is hard to treat because there is just no target q what type of laser is used to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles what our experts say i use a fraxel  by soltamedical i also use the activefx a co laser for patients who need a deeper peel and can tolerate a little more down time q what type of laser is used to treat age spots brown spots what are treatment requirements what our experts say it depends on how light the spots are and where they are patients can use a brightening serum scientificskincom that’s my product or an exfoliator to polish the outer skin these would be the least invasive treatment methods a lot of times we can use a qtip and treat each spot with liquid nitrogen which freezes each spot and then it falls off—it works like a charmthere are also a variety of chemical peels that work as well as two types of light therapies intense pulsed light or photodynamic therapy blue light for the face neck and chest area i also use lasers to treat brown spots the fraxel  the alexandrite laser and the ndyag laser these would be the most invasive treatments the darker the spot the more invasive the treatment and the higher the likelihood of having a white spot afterwards q are there risks involved with using botox what our experts say any time we touch someone with a needle there can be injection site discomfort and some local redness but these are small risks botox has specific risks such as occasional headaches and sometimes you can get eyelid or eyebrow heaviness but that’s most commonly seen in people who are straining their forehead and using muscles or holding their eyelid or eyebrow up it’s not really a side effect but more of an unmasking of something the muscles were compensating for if we relax their entire forehead and things tend to drop they may need surgery instead to remove excess skin a lot of the time if the forehead is treated in an overly aggressive way and every line is removed especially the lower  of them that is usually when that complication occurs q whats the opinion of plasma replacement therapy for filler what our experts say i think that prp can supplement fillers and may make them look better and last longer but thus far the data is not really dramatic so i dont use it in my office i

other way just kidding about the last part q whats the best way to treat sun damage what our experts say the best way to treat sun damage is with a combination approach such as a topical medication  cosmeceutical retin a and vitamin c are two that come to mind and a light source or laser for light sources i recommend intense pulsed light or photodynamic therapy using a dye with an activation light for laser i like the fractionated co or fractionated non ablative laser fraxel is one good example of this q are cosmeceuticals regulated by the fda the same way as prescription topicals what our experts say cosmeceuticals are not regulated to the same degree as drugs they fall into a grey area that is not subject to the same regulation as drugs any product that claims to make a difference really needs to do so there is no difference between those sold by doctors and those sold by others there is no distinction between a cosmeceutical and a skin care product in this regard q i am a

this and why do i continue to have flare ups every few weeks what our experts say you may have a bacterial infection instead of regular acne one needs to culture it to see what type of bacteria is

or isolase to treat it finally isotretinoin may be required to get it under control q im forty two with extra pigment on my face for the past twenty i hate it i want it of my face already what our experts say depends on your sun exposure hormone status eg are you taking birth control and pigment type if you have light pigment irregularity salicylic acid peels like those from theraplex can help

my age of  still its same but no improvements as well as it has not been worse what our experts say the best supplement to take is iron feosol i don’t think that food supplements can make a significant difference so i wouldn’t worry about that i would make sure that your thyroid and other hormones are normal especially the male hormones i think that you can use minoxidil and perhaps bimatoprost can help grow hair finally there are some dermatologists that specialize in hair at university centers q what is the best cream to apply to remove dark pigmentations at the armpit what our experts say hydroquinone and tretinoin  q i have small thin hairlike red veins around my cheeks can i get rid of it with a laser and if so what is the downtime will my skin peel and be very red what our experts say these are easily treated with pulsed dye laser typically this requires  visits while some lasers don’t produce a lot of bruising my impression is that the ones that bruise require fewer treatments to get done i have two different pulse dye lasers and use them frequently when people have lighter vessels i use my intense pulsed light to help get rid of them this is nice because there is usually no bruising q what if you pop a zit and you accedentally peel your skin off how can you heal it fast what our experts say not a good idea however  if you have already done this put on some bacitracin and leave it alone they usually repair in a few days q how often do cellulite treatments need to be done for optimum results what our experts say depends on the treatment the ones that i use exilis and smoothshapes require treatments once a week  others such as zeltiq are done once per area  q is there someone knowing something about the rt topical gel what our experts say as i know there is botulinum toxin type a topical gel being in trial and is prospective to be approved by fda is that true  from what is posted on clinicaltrialsgov this is true the gel is a topical type of botulinum toxin that is in trials across the us q how can i make my lips look puffy and plump what our experts say inject them or use my eyesculpt product which my patients have told me is wonderful for lip lines i like to inject lips with a clear product such as restylane perlane juvederm or belotero  my patients like a natural look so i try to provide lip definition instead of monkey lips  q can lasers can darken melasma what our experts say absolutely any injury can drop pigment into the skin from the outer layers into the dermis lasers will do this and the stronger the laser the higher the chance of darkening it is far better to use a laser that is gentle and designed to treat melasma or do a series of light peels salicylic acid such as theraplex peels than to do one big procedure q is there anything to help with white spots from acne scars i have been told it is hypopigmentation what our experts say this is true it is hypopigmentation loss of pigment there are a few things that can be done if the scars are depressed as most are one can get treated with a fractional laser to help this once the surface is smoother scars tend to be less noticeable and in some instances pigment cells migrate in with the new skin that grows there are some experimental treatments that grow pigment cells which in the future can be transplanted q home vs professional microdermabrasion diamond tome what our experts say the home systems are more gentle and do not do as much the good part is that they are not as likely to get you into trouble q if i dont actually peel after my chemical peel is it still effective what our experts say usually it is because a superficial layer will slough however some peels are designed to be light and for these multiple peels are required to see any effectiveness peels such as the theraplex salicylic acid peel are effective with minimal slough deeper peels such as tca trichloracetic acid will almost always peel q how are dysport and xeomin different from botox what our experts say it’s kind of like coke and pepsi in a lot of respects injectors have a different response depending on a patient’s anatomy and biology they are all good products xeomin is a protein that doesn’t have additional molecules with it that bind the actual active molecule some physicians think this is better while others prefer the carrier molecules each is manufactured in a different way and there are subtle differences between them each has its own advocates but botox still retains the lead in terms of number of injections the arrival of the two new competitors has increased the amount of people getting injections so they all are increasing their marketing because of competition q what is the difference between restylane and perlane juvéderm radiesse belotero where is each of them used what our experts say the biggest difference is what they are made of restylane perlane juvéderm and belotero are hyaluronic acids or sugarderived molecules they are all clear and gelbased juvéderm tends to be smoother and great for thin skin and for filling superficial lines restylane and perlane are more particulate and firmer so are better for injectable facelifts and sculpting to lift up the midface or if there are deeper lines we use a thicker product like radiesse radiesse is a calciumbased filler that is white and thicker because of its color and thickness it needs to be placed deeper in the skin it’s not intended for use in the lips or under the eyes any of the hyaluronic acids can be digested so that if you get a lump or a bump it’s easy to fix radiesse is harder to get rid of but the flip side is that it lasts longer and has a lot more lifting capability q what is photodynamic therapy pdt treat what our experts say pdt is used to treat age spots sun damage and it’s great for photorejuvenation in addition i use it to treat precancerous spots on the skin it’s more invasive than intense pulsed light ipl when done correctly it’s like the worst sunburn you could ever have it will get your attention both during treatment and after we combine this with ipl which is great for shaving off a lot of sundamaged years patients treated with pdt or co laser require the most follow up care we see those people almost daily because without the skin as an intact barrier patients get into trouble with allergies and irritation it takes about a week to heal  q upper lip  verical wrinkles above the lip what our experts say i like a small amount of botox dysport or xeomin to relax the muscles around the mouth i also like to use a firming cream to help stiffen the skin in many of my patients i will customize a filler many of them are too thick for the thin skin of this area by adding some saline or lidocaine to thin it out i will then inject it to reduce the lines finally patients with these lines can benefit from ablative co laser q would you rather put fat in a face or juvéderm restylane sculptra or radiesse what our experts say depends on the face but in general i am not a fan of fat in my hands it was unpredictable and lumpy so i stopped it and instead use products that are consistently the same thickness and duration i like juvederm for fine lines where i am trying to lift the skin up about  mm i like restylane and perlane for thicker lines lifting cheeks and filling tear troughs it is wonderful in mid thick skin sculptra is great to add volume in an area that has sunken in and restores a really youthful appearance to the cheeks and temples i usually combine sculptra with fillers radiesse is a thicker white product that has great lifting capability i like it for the hands cheeks temples and smile lines i don’t like it for the tear trough lips or fine line belotero is wonderful for superficial lines around the mouth and also a great product for the tear troughs i also inject it into the fine lines of the forehead and chin in europe they are using voluma to lift it is a thicker hyaluronic acid designed to lift the face      quoted in the super easy fix to rejuvenate aging sagging earlobes a topical filler may be here sooner than you think how to get a spotfree

expect my skin to look like after treatment what our experts say it’s probably the oldest and most widely used lasers to treat broken blood vessels and scars or anything that’s red including stretch marks and rosacea the only thing i don’t use it for is leg veins it’s approved to treat that but i find that it gives unacceptable white spots afterwards it’s a pretty mild treatment that freezes the skin before the light beam hits it so it’s pretty comfortable q where is botox most commonly injected what our experts say botox is most commonly injected in the area it’s fda approved for frown lines a close second is a combination of injections into the forehead and outside the brow to give a brow lift q how long does botox take after it’s injected to work how long do the effect last what our experts say there are studies that show that within  hourspatients notice an onset but typically we see maximal onset in  to  days also studies using dysport xeomin show a very rapid onset sometimes within  to  days  how long it lasts depends on the dose  if you go to discount place that waters it down it might only last  to  weeks but in general the duration is  to  months and you get longer duration after several visits  patients who have been treated for  to  years break their habit of wrinkling so they don’t need to use it again for  months or more q is collagen still used as a filler what our experts say no q how do you treat “lipstick bleed” lines what our experts say carefully i will do a variety of things sometime i use dilute hyaluronic acid mixed with saline to thin it out and inject using a small needle into the fold  i also use one of botulinum toxins to weaken the pucker muscles or one of my co lasers to etch out the lines q what was evolence what our experts say it was a pigderived collagen product that they are no longer marketing in the united states it was great for filling lines in my opinion it’s a shame it got pulled  q what is the treatment for spider veins does it hurt how many treatments do i need what our experts say if the veins are smaller than a paper clip then i like to inject them if they are bigger then i send the patient to someone for an ultrasound evaluation and an endovenous intervention both of those should be done by someone who does a lot of it either a vascular surgeon an interventional radiologist or a dermatologist with vascular skill i don’t treat anything bigger than a paperclip i don’t do anything i can’t do really well q what does ipl intense pulsed light treat who is the best candidate for this does it hurt what our experts say ipl is great for skin texture brown spots and red spots we use it all day it’s great at reversing the signs of sun damage and aging i have not had anyone who couldn’t tolerate it it feels like a rubber band there is really minimal downtime the skin gets pink with a little flaking for a few days the best candidate would be a fairskinned person who has been exposed to a lot of sun it would be a patient who could come in a few times for treatments and then they will need to use sun protection a skin brightening serum andor retinaa they will proceed gradually and will stick to a program q what is the best treatment for cellulite how long until you see results how long do results last how many treatments do you need what our experts say having decent parents the best treatment for cellulite remains to be seen right now there are two treatments that are good for it smoothshapes laser by cynosure and zeltiq each has its advantages and disadvantages i made the decision to use smoothshapes and i am thrilled with it it’s not a home run but none are it uses two different wavelengths to mobilize and melt fat and then uses suction to increase blood flow it’s totally noninvasive it’s like having a massage the patient has to come in two times a week for four to six weeks we are now trying protocols to decrease the number of visits by having longer treatments i recommend completing the course of treatment and then coming in for an enhancement at six to  months because as women age they continue to make new cellulite after treatment they will see some change in the appearance of the fat i have seen in some people some change in the size of the area treated as well what i tell people is the appearance will change but the measurement may not q how long do fillers last what our experts say prevelle lasts for a few weeks it’s a low concentration a low crosslinked hyaluronic acid radiesse lasts six to nine months sculptra lasts  to  months juvéderm restylane and perlane last six to  months depending on whether an enhancement injection is done after the initial injection q what is sculptra used for what our experts say it’s a collagenstimulating molecule whereas other products are used for lifting sculpting or filling sculptra is used for volume replenishment it causes the body to make collagen and unlike the other fillers it requires a series of injections it’s absolutely wonderful for sunken cheeks fallen temples filling out the jawline and it can bridge the gap between filling lines and facial volume restoration as we agethe face loses volume and everything goes south sculptra can reinflate the face and pull things north by creating collagen you can combine sculptra with other products this really gives someone a renovation without surgical intervention q what is isolaz used to treat what our experts say it’s another type of laser we use for the treatment of acne it’s approved for other things but it’s primarily an acne laser it combines laser energy with a vacuum it’s really great at cleaning out the skin q can a fraxel laser be used on other areas of the body what our experts say it can all be used on other parts of the body we just have to have the experience and adjust the energy q what is the best laser of overall facial rejuvenation what our experts say if you can tolerate the downtime the co activefx or deepfx if they don’t have a few days for downtime than i would use the fraxel it doesn’t go as deep i also like a pixilated laser which erases fragments or dots and allows islands of normal skin to stay the skin gets red but typically there is no downtime q do fillers in the lips stimulate collagen production what our experts say there is a lot of information that fillers in any part of the body stimulate collagen production in some patients not only does it stimulate collagen production but after a few injections the products begin to last longer between these two mechanisms the injections get really great results  q what can i do for thin skin what our experts say use things that prevent more thinning – sun protection and not smoking in addition try to incorporate vitamin c and retin a or retinol in your daily skin care regime q are there any effective lasers out there used to tighten knee area what our experts say there are the trick is to find one that works and then do a series of treatments i like the radiofrequency device and in my office i use the exilis i have not used the ultrasound machines in this area but think they probably help q is it safe to have ipl and yag laser done on the same spots at the same time what our experts say probably not i would use one or the other they have some overlap and i would be cautious about over treating q is it common to have loss of pigment after tca peel what our experts say it sounds like there may be some scarring scars tend not to have pigment in them so this may be part of the problem  it is unusual to see this after a tca peel if it was done at lower strengths so you should check in with the doc that did the peels to make sure everything is ok if you are white in some areas there are a few things that one can try to even them out but sun protection and time help immensely if that does not work bimatoprost topically may help q what type of laser is used for hair removal who is the best candidate what our experts say the alexandrite laser made by candela it works best on those with light skin and dark hair the energy that gets focused is on a primary target which is the hair shaft if the patient has dark skin diode lasers can be used we can also use an alexandrite laser at lower energies no matter what laser is used the darker the skin the harder it is to treat the same holds true for light hair which is hard to treat because there is just no target q what type of laser is used to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles what our experts say i use a fraxel  by soltamedical i also use the activefx a co laser for patients who need a deeper peel and can tolerate a little more down time q what type of laser is used to treat age spots brown spots what are treatment requirements what our experts say it depends on how light the spots are and where they are patients can use a brightening serum scientificskincom that’s my product or an exfoliator to polish the outer skin these would be the least invasive treatment methods a lot of times we can use a qtip and treat each spot with liquid nitrogen which freezes each spot and then it falls off—it works like a charmthere are also a variety of chemical peels that work as well as two types of light therapies intense pulsed light or photodynamic therapy blue light for the face neck and chest area i also use lasers to treat brown spots the fraxel  the alexandrite laser and the ndyag laser these would be the most invasive treatments the darker the spot the more invasive the treatment and the higher the likelihood of having a white spot afterwards q are there risks involved with using botox what our experts say any time we touch someone with a needle there can be injection site discomfort and some local redness but these are small risks botox has specific risks such as occasional headaches and sometimes you can get eyelid or eyebrow heaviness but that’s most commonly seen in people who are straining their forehead and using muscles or holding their eyelid or eyebrow up it’s not really a side effect but more of an unmasking of something the muscles were compensating for if we relax their entire forehead and things tend to drop they may need surgery instead to remove excess skin a lot of the time if the forehead is treated in an overly aggressive way and every line is removed especially the lower  of them that is usually when that complication occurs q whats the opinion of plasma replacement therapy for filler what our experts say i think that prp can supplement fillers and may make them look better and last longer but thus far the data is not really dramatic so i dont use it in my office i prefer to use fillers that are reliable q if you are going to be treated with juvederm for under eye hollows and to add a bit of volume to your cheeks and also ulthera for some lifting in the brow area tightening under the eyes and jowel area which should be done first and how far apart what our experts say i would

into the dermis lasers will do this and the stronger the laser the higher the chance of darkening it is far better to use a laser that is gentle and designed to treat melasma or do a series of light peels salicylic acid such as theraplex peels than to do one big procedure q is there anything to help with white spots from acne scars i have been told it is hypopigmentation what our experts say this is true it is hypopigmentation loss of pigment there are a few things that can be done if the scars are depressed as most are one can get treated with a fractional laser to help this once the surface is smoother scars tend to be less noticeable and in some instances pigment cells migrate in with the new skin that grows there are some experimental treatments that grow pigment cells which in the future can be transplanted q home vs professional microdermabrasion diamond tome what our experts say the home systems are more gentle and do not do as much the good part is that they are not as likely to get you into trouble q if i dont actually peel after my chemical peel is it still effective what our experts say usually it is because a superficial layer will slough however some peels are designed to be light and for these multiple peels are required to see any effectiveness peels such as the theraplex salicylic acid peel are effective with minimal slough deeper peels such as tca trichloracetic acid will almost always peel q how are dysport and xeomin different from botox what our experts say it’s kind of like coke and pepsi in a lot of respects injectors have a different response depending on a patient’s anatomy and biology they are all good products xeomin is a protein that doesn’t have additional molecules with it that bind the actual active molecule some physicians think this is better while others prefer the carrier molecules each is manufactured in a different way and there are subtle differences between them each has its own advocates but botox still retains the lead in terms of number of injections the arrival of the two new competitors has increased the amount of people getting injections so they all are increasing their marketing because of competition q what is the difference between restylane and perlane juvéderm radiesse belotero where is each of them used what our experts say the biggest difference is what they are made of restylane perlane juvéderm and belotero are hyaluronic acids or sugarderived molecules they are all clear and gelbased juvéderm tends to be smoother and great for thin skin and for filling superficial lines restylane and perlane are more particulate and firmer so are better for injectable facelifts and sculpting to lift up the midface or if there are deeper lines we use a thicker product like radiesse radiesse is a calciumbased filler that is white and thicker because of its color and thickness it needs to be placed deeper in the skin it’s not intended for use in the lips or under the eyes any of the hyaluronic acids can be digested so that if you get a lump or a bump it’s easy to fix radiesse is harder to get rid of but the flip side is that it lasts longer and has a lot more lifting capability q what is photodynamic therapy pdt treat what our experts say pdt is used to treat age spots sun damage and it’s great for photorejuvenation in addition i use it to treat precancerous spots on the skin it’s more invasive than intense pulsed light ipl when done correctly it’s like the worst sunburn you could ever have it will get your attention both during treatment and after we combine this with ipl which is great for shaving off a lot of sundamaged years patients treated with pdt or co laser require the most follow up care we see those people almost daily because without the skin as an intact barrier patients get into trouble with allergies and irritation it takes about a week to heal  q upper lip  verical wrinkles above the lip what our experts say i like a small amount of botox dysport or xeomin to relax the muscles around the mouth i also like to use a firming cream to help stiffen the skin in many of my patients i will customize a filler many of them are too thick for the thin skin of this area by adding some saline or lidocaine to thin it out i will then inject it to reduce the lines finally patients with these lines can benefit from ablative co laser q would you rather put fat in a face or juvéderm restylane sculptra or radiesse what our experts say depends on the face but in general i am not a fan of fat in my hands it was unpredictable and lumpy so i stopped it and instead use products that are consistently the same thickness and duration i like juvederm for fine lines where i am trying to lift the skin up about  mm i like restylane and perlane for thicker lines lifting cheeks and filling tear troughs it is wonderful in mid thick skin sculptra is great to add volume in an area that has sunken in and restores a really youthful appearance to the cheeks and temples i usually combine sculptra with fillers radiesse is a thicker white product that has great lifting capability i like it for the hands cheeks temples and smile lines i don’t like it for the tear trough lips or fine line belotero is wonderful for superficial lines around the mouth and also a great product for the tear troughs i also inject it into the fine lines of the forehead and chin in europe they are using voluma to lift it is a thicker hyaluronic acid designed to lift the face      services general and cosmetic dermatology skin cancer surgery mohs surgery nonsurgical injectable
