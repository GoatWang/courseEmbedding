downturn of  a retrospective  bokf energy outstandings peaked at nearly  billion in december  as the downturn was accelerating  predownturn peak was  oil in june  and  gas on in february   our predownturn expectations from  earnings conference call  “we believe the highest near term risk in energy lending is in two areas  energy services and second lien or ‘b’ tranches of loans”  “we see two distinct risk periods…if commodity prices take less than a year to return to a normalized stable level we will see some credits migrate to problem loans but few if any material losses in the portfolio the spillover impact on the overall economy in our footprint will be manageable”  if the downturn does not behave like previous downturns longer term outcomes are obviously more difficult to predict at that point we would be more likely to see loss content in the portfolio and a greater impact on the overall economy and in turn lower loan demand across the business”   click to enlarge  the energy downturn of  a retrospective  what happened  the downturn lasted over two years  there was no noticeable “spillover effect” in oildependent states  bokf experienced only one material loss of  million out of a predownturn portfolio of over  borrowers  bokf experienced total cumulative losses of  million or  percent of  outstandings  bokf was consistently  or  in terms of credit performance among energy banks all throughout the downturn  low criticized energy assets as a percentage of portfolio  low loss expectations llr as a  of outstandings   click to enlarge  the energy downturn of   lessons learned  portfolio composition mattered  sncs generally performed better than nonsncs  large ep borrowers performed better than small ep borrowers  first lien senior secured positions did not get equitized  widescale drawdowns on lines of credit did not occur  private equity never left the market – although it did slow in q   texas and oklahoma are more diverse than investors believed and it was not “another s” in oil patch states  services held up reasonably well  the regulators were reasonable and took prudent actions through the downturn  opec and its machinations were largely irrelevant  us exploration and production companies became recognized as the swing producers and they behaved rationally  production and demand balanced – but it took time
