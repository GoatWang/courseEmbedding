argues that governmenttogovernment foreign aid has harmed africa and should be phased out it became a new york times bestseller and has been published in chinese english french german greek italian japanese korean polish portuguese spanish and dutchcitation needed the financial times summarized the books argument stating limitless development assistance to african governments moyo argues has fostered dependency encouraged corruption and ultimately perpetuated poor governance and poverty the book suggests that official development assistance oda as opposed to humanitarian aid perpetuates the cycle of poverty and hinders economic growth in africa the book offers developing countries proposals for financing development instead of relying on foreign governmenttogovernment aid harvard professor and historian niall ferguson wrote the foreword to dead aid rwandan president paul kagame wrote that dead aid has given us an accurate evaluation of the aid culture today in a review of the book economist paul collier stated aid is not a very potent instrument for enhancing either security or accountability our obsession with it has detracted from the more important ways in which we can promote development peacekeeping security guarantees trade privileges and governance the proaid organization one campaign disagreed with the book stating that it calls to cutoff all aid moyo has pointed out in a number of interviews that this is a misrepresentation of her ideas and that she is not criticizing humanitarian aid and the financial times noted that ones campaign at least partially backfired the economist jeffrey sachs said more foreign aid is needed to improve conditions for africa but moyo pointed out that when sachs was her lecturer at harvard it was he himself who taught that the path to longterm development would only be achieved through private sector involvement and free market solutions in a  interview bill gates was asked for his views on dead aids illustration that aid to african governments has not alleviated poverty but has instead kept the african economy crippled rather than supporting sustainable african business he claimed to have read the book and stated books like that – theyre promoting evil responding on her website moyo stated to cast aside the arguments i raised in dead aid at a time when we have witnessed the transformative economic success of countries like china brazil and india belittles my experiences and those of hundreds of millions of africans how the west was lostedit moyos second book how the west was lost fifty years of economic folly – and the stark choices that lie ahead  gives an account of the decline of the economic supremacy of the west over the past  years and posits that the worlds most advanced economies are squandering their economic lead in her opinion moyo examines how america’s flawed decisions and blinkered policy choices around capital labor and technology have resulted in an economic and geopolitical seesaw that is poised to tip in favor of the emerging world the book became a new york times bestseller debuting at no  it also debuted at no  in the washington post and no  in the wall street journals and nielsen bookscans business bestsellers in a review paul collier stated that her diagnosis of the recent disasters in financial markets is succinct and sophisticated and i applaud her brave alarum against our economic and social complacency her core concerns are sufficiently close to painful truths to warrant our attention dominic lawson wrote in the sunday times this argument … can rarely have been made more concisely moyo is a very serious lady indeed the guardian stated how the west was lost is more interesting wider in scale and more important than dead aid in contrast alan beattie of the financial times wrote the challenges it identifies are for the most part real if not original but the huge flaws of the emerging economies are ignored the economist said these arguments need much better supporting material than the book provides winner take alledit moyos third book winner take all chinas race for resources and what it means for the world  examines the commodity dynamics that the world will face over the next several decades according to moyo in particular it explores the implications of chinas rush for natural resources across all regions of the world noting that the scale of china’s resource campaign for hard commodities metals and minerals and soft commodities timber and food is one of the largest in history moyo presents her research and conclusions concerning the financial and geopolitical implications of a world of diminishing resources winner take all continues where how the west was lost left off and moyo argues that china is already well on the way to gaining the upper hand in world economic dominance winner take all became a new york times bestseller debuting at no  as well as entering the wall street journals and

most populous state are bad news for the rest of us one cannot accuse moyo of failing to do her homework the independent concluded this is not an elegantly written book but she does go to the heart of the issue what china does over resources is profoundly important and that deserves our attention the telegraph commented moyo thinks china’s impact on the global commodity market will go on and on

fostered dependency encouraged corruption and ultimately perpetuated poor governance and poverty the book suggests that official development assistance oda as opposed to humanitarian aid perpetuates the cycle of poverty and hinders economic growth in africa the book offers developing countries proposals for financing development instead of relying on foreign governmenttogovernment aid harvard professor and historian niall ferguson wrote the foreword to dead aid rwandan president paul kagame wrote that dead aid has given us an accurate evaluation of the aid culture today in a review of the book economist paul collier stated aid is not a very potent instrument for enhancing either security or accountability our obsession with it has detracted from the more important ways in which we can promote development peacekeeping security guarantees trade privileges and governance the proaid organization one campaign disagreed with the book stating that it calls to cutoff all aid moyo has pointed out in a number of interviews that this is a misrepresentation of her ideas and that she is not criticizing humanitarian aid and the financial times noted that ones campaign at least partially backfired the economist jeffrey sachs said more foreign aid is needed to improve conditions for africa but moyo pointed out that when sachs was her lecturer at harvard it was he himself who taught that the path to longterm development would only be achieved through private sector involvement and free market solutions in a  interview bill gates was asked for his views on dead aids illustration that aid to african governments has not alleviated poverty but has instead kept the african economy crippled rather than supporting sustainable african business he claimed to have read the book and stated books like that – theyre promoting evil responding on her website moyo stated to cast aside the arguments i raised in dead aid at a time when we have witnessed the transformative economic success of countries like china brazil and india belittles my experiences and those of hundreds of millions of africans how the west was lostedit moyos second book how the west was lost fifty years of economic folly – and the stark choices that lie ahead  gives an account of the decline of the economic supremacy of the west over the past  years and posits that the worlds most advanced economies are squandering their economic lead in her opinion moyo examines how america’s flawed decisions and blinkered policy choices around capital labor and technology have resulted in an economic and geopolitical seesaw that is poised to tip in favor of the emerging world the book became a new york times bestseller debuting at no  it also debuted at no  in the washington post and no  in the wall street journals and nielsen bookscans business bestsellers in a review paul collier stated that her diagnosis of the recent disasters in financial markets is succinct and sophisticated and i applaud her brave alarum against our economic and social complacency her core concerns are sufficiently close to painful truths to warrant our attention dominic lawson wrote in the sunday times this argument … can rarely have been made more concisely moyo is a very serious lady indeed the guardian stated how the west was lost is more interesting wider in scale and more important than dead aid in contrast alan beattie of the financial times wrote the challenges it identifies are for the most part real if not original but the huge flaws of the emerging economies are ignored the economist said these arguments need much better supporting material than the book provides winner take alledit moyos third book winner take all chinas race for resources and what it means for the world  examines the commodity dynamics that the world will face over the next several decades according to moyo in particular it explores the implications of chinas rush for natural resources across all regions of the world noting that the scale of china’s resource campaign for hard commodities metals and minerals and soft commodities timber and food is one of the largest in history moyo presents her research and conclusions concerning the financial and geopolitical implications of a world of diminishing resources winner take all continues where how the west was lost left off and moyo argues that china is already well on the way to gaining the upper hand in world economic dominance winner take all became a new york times bestseller debuting at no  as well as entering the wall street journals and nielsen bookscans business bestsellers at no  and the publishers weekly nonfiction bestseller list at no  a review in the financial times stated that if dambisa moyo is right the demands of the worlds most populous state are bad news for the rest of us one cannot accuse moyo of failing to do her homework the independent concluded this is not an elegantly written book but she does go to the heart of the issue what china does over resources is profoundly important and that deserves our attention the telegraph commented moyo thinks china’s impact on the global commodity market will go on and on powered by an unstoppable chinese economy perhaps she is right but the grounds for doubting whether the future will be a straight line from the past deserve a hearing the guardian wrote for all moyos insistence that a crisis is inevitable and that china will be the only gainer we are in uncertain territory here additional publications and lecturesedit moyo is a frequent public speaker and

new window try abebooks description in the past fifty years more than  trillion in developmentrelated aid has been transferred from rich countries to africa has this assistance improved the lives of africans no in fact across the continent the recipients of this aid are not better off as a result of it but worsemuch worse in dead aid dambisa moyo describes the state of postwar development policy in africa today and unflinchingly confronts one of the greatest myths of our time that billions of dollars in aid sent from wealthy countries to developing african nations has helped to reduce poverty and increase growth in fact poverty levels continue to escalate and growth rates have steadily declinedand millions continue to suffer provocatively drawing a sharp contrast between african countries that have rejected the aid route and prospered and others that have become aiddependent and seen poverty increase moyo illuminates the way in which overreliance on aid has trapped developing nations in a vicious circle of aid dependency corruption market distortion and further poverty leaving them with nothing but the need for more aid debunking the current model of international aid promoted by both hollywood celebrities and policy makers moyo offers a bold new road map for financing development of the worlds poorest countries that guarantees economic growth and a significant decline in povertywithout reliance on foreign aid or aidrelated assistance dead aid is an unsettling yet optimistic work a powerful challenge to the assumptions and arguments that support a profoundly misguided development policy in africa and it is a clarion call to a new more hopeful vision of how to address the desperate poverty that plagues millionsshow more product details format hardback   pages
