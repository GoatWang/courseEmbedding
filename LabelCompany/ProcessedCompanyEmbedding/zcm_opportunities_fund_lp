shareholders for change’ group of concerned ipass inc shareholders combine to form ipass shareholders for change issues open letter to ipass shareholdersexpresses profound disappointment with the current boards apparent failure to protect and enhance shareholder valuehas attempted to engage constructively with ipass board of directors but to no availseeks to reconstitute ipass board at the upcoming  annual meeting with five highly qualified director candidates who have strong relevant backgrounds apr    et from maguire asset management llc laguna beach calif april   prnewswire  a group of ipass inc nasdaq ipas ipass or the company investors led by maguire asset management francis capital management and foxhill opportunity fund who collectively own approximately  of ipass shares outstanding announced today that they have combined to form ipass shareholders for change and that they will be seeking to reconstitute the board of directors of ipass the board at the companys upcoming  annual meeting which is expected to be held in june  ipass shareholders for change also announced today that it has issued an open letter to ipass shareholders in which the group among other things details how certain of its members have attempted for many years to work constructively with the board to improve the companys performance and governance enhance value and restore investor confidence but to no avail also in the letter the investor group expresses its profound disappointment with the failure of leadership at ipass under the current board and the groups belief that new leadership is not only warranted at ipass but long overdue  to that end ipass shareholders for change expects to file later today preliminary proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission for the election of five new highlyqualified director nominees at the  annual meeting  ipass shareholders for changes director nominees are richard a karp brent s morrison damien j park norman j rice iii and kenneth h traub  bios for each of the director nominees are included in the letter below the full text of the letter open letter to ipass shareholders april   dear fellow ipass shareholder we are a group of concerned investors of ipass inc ipass or the company who have organized as ipass shareholders for change we collectively own an aggregate of  shares of common stock of ipass constituting approximately  of the companys shares outstanding  over the past seven years certain members of our investment group have attempted to maintain a constructive and cordial relationship with the companys management and members of the board of directors the board with the hope that our value improvement recommendations would be taken seriously and implemented for the benefit of all shareholders  the dialogue has covered many issues and serious concerns regarding among other things the companys business strategy underperformance strategic alternatives review process poor capital allocation decisions executive compensation bloated expenses and poor corporate governance practices all for the purpose of helping to fundamentally improve the business we are writing today to express our profound disappointment with the outcome of this engagement and with the current boards apparent failure to protect and enhance shareholder value  simply put we believe that the problematic status quo and troubling underperformance at ipass is largely a result of a failure of the board and that new leadership is not only warranted but long overdue to that end we expect to file later today preliminary proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission in connection with our efforts to solicit your support to elect five new highlyqualified director nominees to the board at ipass  annual meeting which is expected to take place in early june  despite the multiplefailed attempts to sell the business since  continually falling short of executing several different business plans the ongoing operating losses and the alarming cash depletion we remain confident that under the right leadership and direction ipass can generate significant value for shareholders  as the worlds largest commercial wifi network with over  million access points across  countries we believe ipass is a valuable yet underappreciated business supported by a dedicated group of exceptional employees however we believe the market will continue to apply a significant discount to ipass market value until investor confidence is fully restored in our opinion the most effective way to enhance shareholder value and to restore investor confidence is by immediately reconstituting the board with these five seasoned professional business leaders who have deep relevant operational and industry experience  if elected our nominees will bring a fresh perspective into the boardroom undergo a thorough examination of the recently abandoned strategic alternatives review
