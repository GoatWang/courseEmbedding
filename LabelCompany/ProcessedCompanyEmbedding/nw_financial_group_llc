structured products the use of derivatives in the municipal finance sector  has moved well beyond traditional synthetic fixed rate financings to complex structures that require more than the ability to input a structure into pricing models nw financial has served as financial advisor on over  billion in notional value of swap transactions we have advised clients on a broad variety of swaps and our ability to model market sensitive conditions has resulted in millions of dollars of savings for our governmental clients the types of transactions on which we have advised include replacement swaps including upfront termination payments made by the new provider constant maturity swaps including terminations for a profit trigger swaps where the client selects one percentage of libor until libor reaches a target rate and then converts to a different percentage a useful tool in rising interest rate environments dual index swaps where the client is paid the higher of sifma or libor indexed amount swap termination negotiations forward starting swaps swaptions forward bond refundings with upfront savings payments and renegotiated swaps to shorten or lengthen the tenor we have also assisted our swap clients in analyzing and evaluating their swap portfolio including swap termination opportunity nw financial was among the first to identify a swap termination opportunity that resulted in savings on interest costs by choosing to issue fixed rate debt to replace the swap rather than to renew high cost letters of credit that supported variable rate demand bonds on the short end of the yield curve nw financial’s constant market monitoring identified this opportunity early including pricing the cost of terminating related swap transactions which helped our client not only achieve debt service savings but also improves its credit rating profile from a swap exposure and rate risk point of view swap payment suspension nw financial recently assisted a client’s staff in their evaluation of the benefits of suspending payments on their constant maturity swaps which had a significant positive mark to market in order to capture that benefit and reduce risk for a period of years nw financial has extensive experience with complex derivative products nw financial has extensive experience with complex derivative products nw financial has executed over  billion of swaps and derivatives on behalf of its clients but has also rejected over  billion in proposed transactions that were not in the client’s best interest we have also undertaken extensive sensitivity analysis for our clients on market movements and basis risk prior to recommending a particular product nw financial utilizes both proprietary and nonproprietary models to test trade pricing and assure market transparency our software includes the black 7 model for pricing products such as options and swaptions as a result of our indepth analysis we have been able to identify “hidden” profit components in the proposals that were not known to the proposers investment banking staff including internally adjusted “vol” pricing and off market discount rates we have also been able to negotiate flexibility into trades such as “greater than” payments when leaving one index and moving to another eg monthly to constant maturity as part of our advisory role we provide a fairness opinion analysis of impact
