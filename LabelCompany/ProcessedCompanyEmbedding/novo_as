two danish firms  nordisk insulinlaboratorium and novo terapeutisk laboratorium nordisk insulinlaboratorium was founded by hans christian hagedorn august krogh and august kongsted in  in copenhagen in  august krogh and his wife marie krogh travelled to the us the couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in  by two canadians frederick banting and charles best marie krogh was a doctor herself and also had type  diabetes the couple returned to denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in scandinavia with the economic help from august kongsted – the owner of leo pharmaceutical products  insulin leo was marketed in  when krogh and hagedorn started manufacturing insulin they hired thorvald pedersen and his brother harald pedersen to build the machines for insulin production however thorvald pedersen was fired from nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves thorvald and harald pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed insulin novo in  the brothers named their firm novo terapeutisk laboratorium over the next decades the products were further improved eg with focus on longer effect nevertheless there were still challenges to be met and in the s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases in  novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in  and novo nordisk is market leading

for combination with lifestyle changes including diet to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity including those at particular risk of developing diabetes ryzodeg – a drug for

analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin it is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid myristic acid is bound to the lysine amino acid at position b it is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position b it then slowly dissociates from this complex victoza – a longacting glucagonlike peptide receptor agonist binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone glp that stimulates insulin secretion it is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type  diabetes novolog – a fastacting insulin analog it is a manufactured form of human insulin where a single amino acid has been exchanged this change helps the fastacting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream as a result it starts working in minutes which allows one to take insulin and eat right away fastacting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus novolin n – an intermediateacting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes novolin r – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus novolog mix  – is a product which contains  insulin aspart and  insulin aspart protamine the insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart which delays the action of the insulin giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection the combination of the fastacting form and the longacting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of
