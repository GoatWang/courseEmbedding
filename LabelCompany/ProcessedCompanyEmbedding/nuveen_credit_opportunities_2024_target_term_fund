rrdby adam aloisiadam aloisi portfolio strategy dividend investing reits valuesummarybonds continue to be an unpopular asset given historically comparative lack of yieldthere are many pitfalls when investing in bond funds  the innate lack of capital return visibility especially in a rising rate environment is a huge negativehow target date bond cefs help confront capital return visibilityan analysis and expected return model for nuveens jhy   target term high yield fundconclusion on the investment worthiness of these productswhile there are many risks endemic to the bond market a commonly cited one today is probably duration risk in a rising rate environment as we saw three years ago rapidly rising yields can have a profound deleterious effect on bond pricing individual bonds etfs cefs as well as openended mutual funds all got whacked by the end of  three years later however we find treasuries back to the level track where we first entered the taper tantrum inspired roller coaster hill climb if you invested money in longterm bonds during the winter of  you are likely sitting on some very attractive gains that have eclipsed equity index returns year treasury since  whether you should take those gains and move on at this point is somewhat beyond the scope of this article but clearly one cannot ignore the potential severe opportunity costs of owning long duration bonds during a rising rate environment to mitigate that risk investors can keep blended portfolio duration short so that if rates do rise there will be sooner rather than later opportunity to reinvest matured bonds at higher interest rates however if we are in a secular low rate environment that persists for decades short duration itself would present the opportunity cost as it sacrifices the higheryields available in longer dated bonds the specific problem with bond funds bond funds are an interesting animal in that there is generally no guarantee on what you will receive should you decide to sell unlike an individual bond which specifies potential issuer call or final maturity dates bond fund net asset value fluctuates daily based on the underlying asset pricing and operating costs if i buy a year newly issued bond today with no call feature ill get back my initial investment back on  assuming i choose to hold to maturity if i buy an etf or cef and hold  years what im able to sell shares for at that time will be predicated on managerial performance and underlying moves in the bond market it is for this reason that an individual bond has a huge capital visibility advantage compared to any kind of fund a response to that problem to combat the problem of return of capital visibility there is a small group of closedend funds possessing a defined term feature that may be worth considering they dont solve the problem to a t but represent a viable alternative for the investor seeking the diversification potential discount and convenient cheap leverage attribute of a closedend fund with an associated defined winddown date if you examine a defined maturity fund and can assess current yield discountpremium unii and other fundspecific data one can try to analytically determine if the total incometotal return proposition will be superior to that of individual bonds trading at the current market below are two lists of term maturity bond funds as compiled by cefconnectcom the first list contains municipal funds and the second taxable bond funds as well as a few equityrelated term issues the list should not necessarily be considered complete taxableequity some of the fund names include the year that the fund is expected to terminate for the rest you will need to do additional research via fund literature to figure example as one might expect the taxable distribution rates are generally much higher than in the muni list in line with much of the rest of the cef space about  of  of these funds add leverage to the mix to determine further comparative investment value one must also consider the underlying blended credit quality of the fund in question for example jhy  the nuveen high income  is  composed of sp b rated bonds while gdo  the western asset global defined opportunity is heavily weighted  towards investment grade offerings and isnt slanted to liquidate until december of  investors should look at jhy as a year brated junk bond equivalent while gdo should be viewed as roughly an year bbb bond equivalent  both levered to the tune of about  percent to determine net potential ytm the current distributionyield the current discountpremium to nav and current unii undistributed net investment income must all be considered and weighed as part of the analysis unfortunately we arent privy to the actual trading decisions or velocity in which cash may be raised in advance of liquidation further unii while accurate at the time of publication can vary on a monthtomonth basis dependent on the schedules that the fund is receiving interest income from its bonds also we need to assume that the current asset mark to market is fairly accurate in terms of the current published premiumdiscount also the longer the maturity the more impact the management fee may have over potential forward returns sample analysis as an example of how one might go about generating an expected return model lets take on an analysis of  the highyield fund that according to nuveens website is expected to liquidate on november   a little over four years from now directly from nuveencom heres what we know about jhy today nav premium  per share distribution rate  monthly  annualized yield  annualized at market  unii  as of  current nav  expected liquidation   roughly  months out w  expected nav return well proceed with the assumption that the fund liquidates with its current  net asset value thus confirming the current  premium whether that happens or not is clearly not guaranteed if you think rates will fluctuate wildly over the next four years it might be appropriate to model some nav adjustment depending on what you expect to occur since were looking at very short duration here regardless nav adjustment if any should be minimal it should be noted that despite the positive unii posted in july that the fund just dropped its rate of distribution  from  per month to  per month for next months distribution which weve taken into account above the drop in bond yields over the past nine months coupled with scant upcoming maturities will likely continue to pressure the funds distribution the next step is to examine the funds holdings to assess how much maturitycall pressure may be exerted this can be accomplished through the funds latest comprehensive report scanning jhys holdings it appears the vast majority of bonds mature in  and  which indicates that the yield should hold up fairly well for the next two years still the funds details report shows that there is significant call risk over the next two years  as much as  of the portfolio source nuveen predicting which bonds might be called would be a rather tedious process but assuming bonds are called that could put potentially even earlier pressure on the distribution and were already assuming that  and  could be very weak yield years putting things together is fairly complicated and amounts to a lot of projection on how things will ultimately shake out the fact that bonds yields have generally diminished over the past nine months will not help matters either although of course as i write today bond yields have sprung to life for the first time in quite some time amid hawkish fears putting things together im going to assume  cents per month of distribution until liquidation  cent less per month than todays yield although even that might be optimistic if stars were to negatively align if you disagree you can factor in more optimistic or pessimistic yield capture scenarios fourandaquarter cents works out to  of total distribution or  of yieldtomaturity over  months of remaining operations keep in mind however shares are trading at a  premium currently so we need to deduct that premium from the yield assuming shares liquidate at current nav we are left with  of net yield capture which amounts to a net total return prospect or annual net yield to maturity of roughly  percent if you were to assume that the distribution remained constant at  quite unlikely in my opinion the return would be about  annualized until liquidation again all of this assumes one purchases today and no reinvestment until  if you went straight to the bond market and looked at bb or b credit here are some examples of what you might find source ameritrade assuming frontier nyseftr doesnt fall off the face of the earth in five years that to me clearly seems a better alternative here with an above  ytw call on  and better on final maturity donnelley nasdaqrrd might be a flip of the coin while mgm resorts nysemgm wouldnt appear to possess much value comparatively speaking still jhy is diversified which means that if one of its bonds runs into a specific problem it would have negligible impact compared to the investor who opts for a single issuer that happens to default but you must also factor the  leverage component which to some extent increases risk here all totaled i dont see compelling comparative value in jhy despite its risk mitigation attribute the somewhat universal unknown prospect for yield trailoff close to liquidation seems to cancel the benefit of the term feature in this case the steep premium is also a large hurdle right now recommendationssummary there were a couple of funds that stuck out in the above pictured lists in my opinion one was blackstonegso strategic credit nysebgb the fund trades at a  discount seems to possess substantial unii and yields  percent it liquidates in almost exactly  years another was aforementioned gdo  western asset global corporate defined opportunity weighted towards investment grade bonds with a discount of   yield and again large apparent unii it liquidates in  years these two would seem to offer a good start for further due diligence keep in mind however that the cef bond fund universe has had a sizeable rally over the past  months with combined nav advance and discount narrowing across the board to sum up while an interesting concept term closedend bond funds offer an added layer of analytical confusion and uncertainty to a space already dominated as such locking into defined maturity would seem to have capital benefit in a rising rate environment compared to the majority of perpetual bondrelated cefs however the wind down process leaves capital somewhat impotent compared to individual bond brethren when heading into liquidation like other cef products understanding what you might be getting yourself into is only half the battle the other half is determining whether what you are considering getting into is
