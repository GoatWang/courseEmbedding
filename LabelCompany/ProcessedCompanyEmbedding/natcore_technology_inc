viable most people believe that it would take rich government subsidies to make solar energy costcompetitive with energy derived from fossil fuels they believe it’s going to be that way for many years to come we think they’ll be proven wrong that’s because we’ve developed remarkable new technologies that can completely change the way solar cells are manufactured we’re using a proprietary laser technology to create the natcore foil cell™ the first laserprocessed alllowtemperature solar cell using an aluminum foil laminate to realize an allbackcontact system in doing so we’ve replaced highcost silver with lowcost aluminum we’re also using black silicon technology to optimize low solar cell reflectance we’ve eliminated the traditional thermal vacuum processes such as cvd and pecvd for making antireflective coatings and we’ve eliminated the use of gold as a catalyst in etching silicon wafers the solar cell of tomorrow is already in our laboratory today we are engineering a cell of higher quality and higher efficiency it will be cleaner and less expensive than conventional solar cells read next profile » solar overview natcore foil cell™ black silicon natcore technology  all

wanting to be part of it we leveraged that interest into a consulting business that coordinates solar farm developers cell manufacturers panel manufacturers and builders   our relationships with developers have emphasized an important component of our technology that could have three great shortterm benefits to natcore with respect to commercialization and revenue two of the benefits of our foil cell technology are obvious higher efficiency and lower cost a third benefit may be more subtle but apparently more important to the industry on a shortterm basis that third component is something called celltomodule ctm energy loss a solar cell is a very sophisticated and delicate device it is made in clean rooms with very low tolerances for error this very sophisticated cell is then put into a very inefficient glass box — a solar panel — and that transition typically causes a  energy loss in the cell back contact cells give much better lower ctm numbers but they are normally expensive our cell approach combined with a unique way that the cells can be joined in the solar panel can virtually eliminate this cell tomodule energy loss in an extremely cost effective way for a developer of large solar projects like our projects in australia and vietnam  to  more power has an enormous impact on the economics of a project developers have recently begun to urge us — quite aggressively — to begin producing larger cells that are appropriately sized to immediately integrate into panels in other words they want to quantify and realize the benefits of our ctm advantages as soon as possible as you know our current cells are consistently yielding efficiencies of just under  while these are higher efficiencies than are found in most current commercial cells and while our projections show our technology will achieve efficiencies well into the midtwenties at very low cost we’re discovering that our unique celltomodule advantage could provide a quicker and more direct path to commercialization and revenue we currently work with smaller cells in the lab because it is cost efficient and allows us shorter turnaround time in experiments our scientists are now doing what is necessary to move our technology to standardsize cells that could be used sooner in the industry the business side of our team is listening to the marketplace and what the industry wants the scientific side is adjusting our priorities a bit to fill that need bottom line feedback from the industry continues to demonstrate that our truly unique technology will change the solar energy

presentation december  httpwwwnatcoresolarcomcorewpcontentuploadsnatcoregtmpresentationnrevpdf natcoretechnology natcoretechnology is a research and development company pioneering solar cells with improved efficiency and reduced cost by combining the expertise of our scientists – who are among the most renowned in the solar community – with a wellequipped research facility we are developing approaches that will define the next generation of cells our output is technology our intellectual property is currently protected by  patents granted or pending natcore plans to move our technologies into manufacturing through partnerships that ultimately yield licensing and royalty revenue streams • natcore is a dualpronged business consisting of  commercialising technology licensing royalties material sales  international consulting for industrial scale solar facilities bestofbreed program  the company has been funded via private placement for several years back in a purely rd phase and now looks to turn the corner with revenue generation  primary technology rochester ny research and development center  sf with  sf clean room ♦ natcore foil cell all back contact solar cell the cell is several technologies combined under the product name foil cell the structure uses aluminum instead of industry traditional silver greatly reducing material costs the patented low temperature laser process rids the need for expensive furnaces      • current efficiency  short term target of       • early phase full production estimate       • long term full production estimate  ♦ black silicon the black silicon technology streamlines the path to low solar cell reflectance  by reducing steps in the manufacturing process costs are greatly reduced technical executive summary the vast majority of solar cells produced today employ front contacts—one of the cell’s electrical contacts is the familiar grid of metal lines on the front of a cell even though the grid lines are thin they block light and thus reduce efficiency these standard solar cells are also made with a thermally diffused emitter requiring very high process temperatures c the combination of front contacts and thermally diffused emitters limit current cell efficiency to about  recently a  efficiency was reported – the highest efficiency ever reached for a silicon solar cell the cell in question used only back contacts thus blocking no light it also used a silicon heterojunction shj emitter eliminating high temperature diffusion steps while the achievement showed the value of these approaches the cell was produced using a complicated high cost process the goal then produce a cell like that at low cost the natcore cell leverages laser processing and a revolutionary approach to contactingmetallizing the cell in order to drive out cost while getting to high efficiency our design requires highly defined regions of heavily doped silicon in order to form the base contact of the solar cell by using a powerful focused laser beam small regions of the silicon surface can be melted in the presence of a specially applied dopant allowing that dopant to penetrate the silicon matrix in particular natcore scientists have discovered a method to laserform these dopant regions while not disrupting the high quality emitter already present on the solar cell the laser process is rapid and can be performed in low capital equipment at atmospheric conditions our approach to metallization is game changing silver is a staple of current solar cells being used for its high conductivity and easy processing however it can represent from  to  of the fabrication cost of a solar cell our unique metallization approach relies upon a simple multilayer structure composed of aluminum foils the use of aluminum alone permits great cost saving however there are two additional areas of cost saving with our approach first of all the metallization process leveraging the worldwide volume of aluminum foil production can have a very low capital cost and footprint secondly the resulting cell architecture is ideal for subsequent incorporation into modules cheaply and with low celltomodule ctm losses natcore has specifically protected its laser back contacted cell approach with a number of patent filings covering the architecture laser process and general processing characteristics natcore’s rapid progress in this area is enabled by david carlson member of our science advisory board and charlie gay auxiliary scientific advisor both bring a recognized extensive career in solar technology and business to the table ♦ natcore makes solar energy costcompetitive by increasing efficiency and lowering cost ♦ in a solar cell industry where manufacturers are fighting for fractions of a percent improvement in performance or costs natcore’s new cells will offer costwatt improvements likely well over  – a generational leap in performance that will essentially force adoption by the industry ♦ natcore will have a very quick rampup to significant revenues with virtually no capital expense and margins near  this is because the company’s business model calls for licensing the technology to any and all comers earning royalties on equipment materials and every solar cell sold using the proprietary process   international solar project consulting bestofbreed • provide project financing and

natcore technology inc we are natcore technology we’re a solar rd company and we are creating technology that promises to make solar energy even more costcompetitive with energy derived from fossil fuels to reach that goal we must attain the highest silicon cell efficiencies at the lowest cost our technology promises to do both so we’re changing how solar cells are made we have attracted a team of scientists well known for their achievements in the solar industry we’ve established exclusive licenses andor joint research agreements with rice university the national renewable energy laboratory nrel fraunhofer ise and the university of virginia we’ve received  patents with  more pending company details  n water street suite   rochester  new jersey  usa locations served business type manufacturer industry type energy  solar power market focus nationally across the country about us natcore is aggressively developing two primary technologies lowcost allbackcontact solar cell structures black silicon cells we’ve not only achieved exciting new scientific advances in these technologies we’re also now engaging partners who will help us commercialize them we plan to generate revenue from these technologies via licensing agreements royalties and material sales agreements with solar cell manufacturers and equipment producers and through our bestofbreed program—wherein we leverage our knowledge to function as a consultant on the design and construction of solar cell and panel fabrication facilities and solar farms—we are now generating important revenue to support our rd efforts in this message i’ll bring you up to date o in this message i’ll bring you up to date on our technology improvements our search for potential partners and our bestofbreed power plant opportunities technology remember our mantra increase the efficiency lower the cost we are making progress with improved efficiencies in our laboratory by focusing most of our research efforts on monocrystalline silicon wafers because of their greater efficiency potential in fact the solar industry is now quickly moving to monocrystalline for that reason and we continue to simplify our process that translates directly to reducing cost at competitive or improved efficiencies in the market one of the areas of improvement is our scientists have identified better light wavelengths for our laser process as an example infrared light which cannot be seen by humans is traditionally used in the laser process our scientists have found that this infrared light is only weakly absorbed by silicon which limits the ability to precisely tailor laser pulses as a result they have created a new set of optical components that convert light to green which is absorbed  times more effectively by the silicon these optics allow us to use whichever wavelengths are needed and help push our progress further along additionally we are continually simplifying the process used to produce our aluminum foil bilayer cells we recently have demonstrated that by slight modifications of the composition of an important conductive layer we eliminate a sequence of patterning steps that we have been using up until now this simplification has a direct correlation to reducing costs potential partners the improvement in the foil bilayer cells has added another dimension to our search for a partner whose scale and resources can help us reach the ultrahighefficiency potential that our cells are capable of until now we’d been limiting our quest to cell manufacturers and other companies in the solar industry but our advances with the natcore foil cell™ makes us attractive to aluminum foil manufacturers who want to expand into new highmargin markets by giving the rights to produce our proprietary foil to an aluminum company partner we would also be giving them the opportunity to gain access to the solar industry included in our package would be some type of exclusivity in providing this unique foil in conjunction with license agreements to cell manufacturers we believe that it is a much simpler sell to the aluminum companies at this stage of our development best of breed i continue to believe that our first important revenue will come from our best of breed program which continues to capture the interest of major international projects recently i was hosted by the developers of the belize project i met all the partners and viewed the site for the proposed power facility which is adjacent to the international airport that they are currently building the funding for the solar project is part of the airport funding this airport is currently  completed we are also currently negotiating agreements with and hope to be chosen by a developer who is known very well to us to participate in a multifaceted facility in a middle eastern country we are at a similar level in negotiations with a southeast asian country these latter two projects are each in excess of  mw each has contingent financing one of them also has a sovereign government guarantee   i hope this gives you some idea of the significance of our unique cell technology as well as our flexibility in identifying potential markets whether they be obvious or outside the box most popular related searches measuring in produced water analytical system measurement of oil in water energy efficiency in building solar
