class by our most senior investment professionals over the shorter term however your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks and

alternative investments such as derivatives hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need
