pictures   comments so many friends so little time   comments    comments roman journey comes to an end   comment   it was a fitting end to this roman pilgrimage fridays mass was a votive of the passion of the lord then the two companions for the journey fr uy and fr carter arrived and we were picked up by our driver andrea  a little over two hours later we were on the other side of italy and approaching lanciano the home of the first eucharistic miracle in the th century  the three of us spent a bit over an hour in prayer before the eucharist and then it was time for lunch after pranzo we headed for manoppello  again it was time for prayer  it was really a blessed daytoday will be a day of packing and preparation for the journey to the states which begins very early tomorrow morning pray that i can get to st paul without a hitch or delay  comment roman journal day    comments   the day started early  the catholic traveler had asked me to celebrate mass at st peter for some english speaking pilgrims  this was followed by a little italian breakfast with fr carter  then i was off to the day  there were two things i had left to accomplish  a visit to santa croce and a marvelous pranzo at dino and tonys  on the way home i picked up some clerical items at mancinellis and that was followed by a solemn high nap  comments come to santa rosa   comments   congressbrochure

snapped a picture of a fountain that st gaspar would have ministered near when it was in the piazza montanara then visited san agostino there discovered a beautiful madonna  there was a bw picture there of st john xxiii kissing that same statue caravaggios painting of the madonna of loreto was also in this church started my rosary in the chapel of st monica visited st agnes again and then finished my rosary at the chapel of the madonna del la pace then had a marvelous pranzo with matt pearson a seminarian from wisconsin lunch last about four hours marvelous conversation  comments roman journal day    comments   tuesday morning up shower and shave lauds decide to say mass in the afternoon spent the day among to martyrs more than  of them you need to discover the story of st prassede and st pudenziana  their two churches speak of the witness of thousands of martyrs there is a spot in the center aisle of santa prassede that is a sepulcher of relics of these sacred martyrs  the chapel where the pillar of the flagellation is kept is always an inspiration the images of st prassede  with st pauls arm around her is a beauty then i walk a couple of blocks to santa pudenziana  it is not the same beauty as santa prassede but it is built over the house of the roman senator pudens  the painting depicts his baptism by st peter but you can also see and touch the font where this happened then i visited st mary major again before heading down via merulana  stoped first at the church of st alphonsus to see the image of the perpetual help  then stopped in the church of sts marcelinus and peter to pray before their relics  then i went to st john lateran prayed before the tomb of leo xiii  after i returned to the bordo where i had a marvelous pranzo with fr patrick resen  on the way home ran into two angelinos who were a marvelous conversation especially as we talked about eucharistic miracles after mass i ended the day with sung vespers at santa trinitas followed by drinks with fr  carter   comments roman journal day    comment   monday morning mass matins lauds prime terce and then out to the distant basilica of san lorenzo visiting his tomb along with st steven and st justin martyr there is also the tomb of blessed pius ix some time in the ancient cloister and then out to the memorial of the visit of pope pius xii to this area right after it had been bombed by the allies then i went over to santa maria della victoria to visit the ecstasy by gian lorenzo bernini in   from there walked about a mile and a half over to st ignatius the most beautiful ceiling in the world  that church also has the tomb of st robert bellermine  then off to pranzo at la pigna from there a visit to gamarrelli and then home for a little nap light cena then to bed early  could not post this in a timely manner as the internet has been dead for about  hours  finally up and running and tuesday afternoon i can post about monday  tuesday will be posted a little later   comment roman journal day    comments   restful day  early morning mass matins lauds prime breakfast  then over to ss trinita dei pellegrini to meet fr carter  after mass we had a marvelous pranzo  one of the things i noticed about the mass as i arrived toward the end was that the church was packed standing room only  after pranzo visited a friend at la botticella where i tasted some trappist beer then headed home for a nap  then cena with taylor marshall and his son gabriel  all in all a restful day with a lot of walking  steps today   comments previous omnia christus est nobis christ is everything
