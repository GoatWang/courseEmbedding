dominic trigg bringing rocket science to the digital advertising industry menu skip to content about open search  reflection and  predictions  has been a really positive year rocket fuel emea has been active in eight territories internationally each reporting significant growth resulting in a substantial contribution to the global business it’s been interesting to see how each market reacts and progresses differently in the programmatic space take the uk for example it continues to be a heavy dominator of rtb and in the programmatic space and it also tends to be the most experimental market germany has embraced the rtb and programmatic space as a brand mechanism this is due in part to publishers embracing the private network environment to sell their inventory and in italy we have seen a real adoption of the selfservice model alongside changes in local markets rocket fuel has also seen some great product improvements and updates such as dynamic creative cross device optimisation and mobile geotargeting the purchase of x and the enterprise model saw an impactful shift on the axis of our business the dmp conversation is absolutely at its zeitgeist companies understand the power of first party data and are determined to utilise it in an effective way now we have come to a time when you can combine that data with technology like ours across a multitude of devices in an impactful way to power more effective and relevant advertising the forrester tei study reports an average of  roi from our dmp offering there has definitely been a fun side to  i’ve had a great time at events that i’ve attended throughout the year the ones that really stand out for me would have to be cannes dmexco and our fantastic company summit in portugal where we had a three day conference with all of our emea employees one of my key highlights of  has to be the people i have worked with this year that’s why it was so important to me to hold a company summit where we could all get together i’ve been working in media for over  years and in the end it comes down to the people that you work with revenue customer satisfaction and growth are all critical factors but you have to have good people working alongside you in summary  has been the year of growing up for rocket fuel we’ve had a period of grown up business practices which will follow as our legacy over the next  years  for rocket fuel means continued investment and growth in the international business investment in product marketing practices and our sales teams for the wider digital space i think brand is going to come to real investment in in  it’s been held so securely by tv but we are definitely chasing that spend giving ourselves and companies as a whole a real opportunity to show people impact at a brand level programmatic tv is going to be a real game changer dominic trigg svpgm emea  emerging markets rocket fuel happy to continue the conversation and connect on twitter december    brits believe artificial intelligence is a force for good not evil artificial intelligence continues to get headlines and there has been a lot of discussion about the negative impact this technology could have on our lives  as a company that uses ai to power our business and drive better more efficient outcomes for our clients’ marketing campaigns we were interested to understand just what is the british public’s perception of artificial intelligence – so we carried out a survey to find out for ourselves the research showed • nearly half of brits  believe ai is a force for good for good or mostly good • just  of brits believe ai is a force for evil •  of brits are excited by ai or think it will solve big world problems • a fifth  see it as a threat or are scared by ai •  don’t believe ai will impact their job does the british public understand what ai is the vast majority of the british public  claim an understanding about what ai is compared to just  who say that they do not know what it is surprisingly nearly half of people believe that ai is something that is already currently used in everyday life  there is a much greater awareness of the uses of ai in everyday life amongst men than women with women more likely to perceive ai as a thing of science fiction or limited to science labs  compared to men  brits are excited by artificial intelligence the research indicates that men and older age groups represent the demographics with the most positive sentiment towards ai the research also finds that males  in the uk are much more excited by ai than women  and that more females  than males  are simply indifferent to ai significantly the over s are the age group most excited about ai  compared to just  of  year olds a development that won’t threaten jobs  of respondents believe ai will not impact their job which is more than double the number that do think it will affect their job either negatively or positively  just  of people believe ai will threaten their job the most suspicious of ai is the younger age group of  year olds with  citing ai as a force for evil which is double the percentage of any other age group it is also  year olds who believe that ai will threaten their jobs  double that of any other age group the findings revealed the overall sentiment towards ai is very positive and the british public well informed our own position on ai is that with the right safeguards in place there is no reason to believe it will be a threat to humanity ai offers practical improvements innovation and efficiency to the uk than any danger rocket fuel’s survey was conducted by gorkana and to be broadly representative of the online population the results are post weighted to be representative of the uk population according to census data dominic trigg svpgm emea  emerging markets rocket fuel happy to continue the conversation and connect on dominic trigg twitter november    reflection of dmexco  i have just returned from the busiest dmexco to date it’s an event that continues to grow with over  people in attendance this year every company that is trading in an effective way across europe tends to be on display at dmexco which is a great way to catch up and network with contacts relationships are made people come by and say hello and you also get to have a look at your competitors which is always an interesting thing to do for rocket fuel it is an event that continues to create a significant amount of business and powerful incentive based on roi rocket fuel at dmexco  this year the topic of ad blocking seemed to be at the top of everyone’s agenda due to the introduction of new technologies and browsers that have made ad blocking possible for the user to control my feelings on ad blocking haven’t changed since the day i got into digital media i strongly believe that content has to find a way to pay for its self content owners the industry and tech owners such as apple need to understand that if they start blocking ads they will effectively block content a lot of “normal” internet users don’t understand that that’s the tradeoff i suspect that the technology will continue to be out there but the adoption of it will change it may also iron out some of the poor practices like over use of retargeting measurement challenges was also a hot topic and is one of the critical factors that this industry needs to address customers want a metric that proves success yet there still isn’t agreement as an industry as a whole as to what this metric is big industries such as tv and radio which have been generating billions of dollars for many years have a unified metric for success – this industry doesn’t have one yet which shows that it is an industry that is still in its infancy i hope we can get to a point where we can say this is what success looks like although dmexco is great for networking and hearing everyone’s opinions on the key topics one of the things i find exhausting is the sheer volume of content you can never get round to seeing it all there are so many halls and speakers that it is difficult to find time to view all of this content from my perspective i think there should be some specific events that focus on what people want to see rather than lots of different companies showcasing their best assets to lots of different halls networking if you’re thinking about attending dmexco next year the key is to plan your time it’s very easy to get wrapped up in the show and get very little done it’s not a question of whether you should be at dmexco it’s a question of how much damage would you be doing to not attend dmexco – having some sort of presence is critical dominic trigg svpgm emea  emerging markets rocket fuel glad to continue the conversation and connect on twitter september    over three quarters  of telecom advertisers plan to increase programmatic spend in  new research released by rocket fuel has revealed a dramatic surge towards programmatic advertising by the telecoms industry     telecoms research   the study into the ad buying habits of the telecoms industry has revealed that over three quarters of advertisers plan to increase their spending on programmatic over the next year the research surveyed  global telecoms advertisers and marketers in q  and q  interestingly the study also uncovered that  of telecom marketers believe they can use firstparty data to drive marketing and business decisions further the study concluded that despite a wealth of firstparty offline data fewer than two in five telecom advertisers  are actually using their data to measure or optimise against online goals i believe that increasingly the telecoms industry is getting wise on the need to utilise ad tech to evolve their businesses and meet performance goals telecom advertising is shifting rapidly to a programmatic dataintensive model and each player in the telecom advertising ecosystem must stay current on the most effective technology and datamanagement strategies   july    the future of artificial intelligence for marketers in uae i recently spoke at the arabnet digital summit in dubai a conference for digital businesses in the middle east the advertising spend in the region is continuously growing – with this massive growth marketers need their their digital advertising campaigns to be efficient and impactful this is where artificial intelligence ai comes into play     ai has already nearly infiltrated every aspect of our daily lives we consult siri the intelligent personal assistant developed by apple enjoy multiplayer games on our xbox or appreciate the personalised film recommendations on netflix when we look at the marketing universe today many of the jobs people have now didn’t even exist a decade or two ago web designers seo consultants social media experts and mobile and web app developers are all relatively young professions we’re seeing yet more roles emerge in this world of big data driven decision making the role of the cmo has already been revolutionised by ai – there have never been more channels with which a marketer can reach their target market nor have cmos had so much data available to them with which they can use to make decisions there is too much complicated data for humans to manage the potential to utilise marketing technology like rocket fuel’s is enormous in the mena region there are currently  million internet users and  million smartphone users – with a particularly high percentage in uae and saudi arabia – and  million tablet users rocket fuel currently sees  million display ad opportunities per day in saudi arabia  million in qatar and in uae  million and the online advertising spend in the region is continuously growing a recent report from pwc predicts that internet advertising will grow from roughly  million in  to  billion in  and especially the mobile channel is booming currently users from the mena region upload around two hours of video every minute on youtube and view  million videos every day which puts the region in the number two spot for video views in the world according to the fifth arab social media report by the dubai school of government consequently mobile advertising is growing in the uae in particular and pwc predicts that by  mobile internet advertising revenue will be four times larger than display and reach  million in uae one thing is certain the emergence and continued development of ai in the marketing sphere is revolutionising the sector and i believe for the better it provides marketers with more time to identify their goals achieve them with greater accuracy whether this be generating awareness attracting new customers or identifying new revenue streams most importantly ai will continue to free up human creative potential and create a myriad of new roles and opportunities that we can’t even begin to imagine june    raring to go after our european conference our recent european rocket fuel conference in sunny portugal has left us all energised for the rest of  and beyond the event reinforced what a special team i have across europe – i saw a collective passion camaraderie and vibrancy throughout the conference included various training and team building sessions which included putting the team through some gruelling objection handling and tricky elevator pitching the teams also delivered some pretty humorous takes on their greatest successes this year in video format we also took inspiration from the truly motivational guest speaker kevin allen founder  chairman of rekap the business transformation company  kevin is recognised as one of the world’s most accomplished growth professionals with a highly successful and illustrious career his team at global marketing agency mccann were the ones behind the success of the “priceless” campaign for mastercard the phrase ‘work hard play hard’ was definitely adopted and put into practice at our conference where a fun time was had by all at the rocket fuel white party and closing bbq   we are all back in the office now feeling motivated ready for action and rocket fuelled   june    the power of data in creating effective campaigns at rocket fuel we work with some of the smartest and most insightful people in the industry and we’re often able to take a look at the bigger picture and show how powerful data is helping to make our campaign more effective if you’re interested in reading the full report you can find it here in a recent report we analysed the advertising creative for  banner ads from  different advertisers over an  month period and found that people respond more positively to male faces in adverts than female faces  adverts featuring men averaged  higher conversion rates than those without a person in them and adverts featuring women saw a  higher conversion rate whilst ads featuring a man and a woman underperformed with a  lower conversion rate interestingly the entertainment industry saw the greatest gender bias   of adverts for entertainment products ranging from films to tv shows to theatre productions featured male celebrities whilst only  of adverts featured female celebrities  the adverts with male celebrities had a  higher conversion rate than ads featuring female celebrities across the board online ads that feature a human in them saw  higher conversion rates than those that didn’t feature a person of either gender the full report a guide to creative optimisation highlights the impact positive and negative different creative design choices have on the success of an online campaign  we dissected the designs to compare elements ranging from background colour promotions and offers inclusions of products humans call to actions and whether an advert was animated or not some other key findings highlighted ads with red backgrounds had  higher conversion rates than average whereas grey backgrounds had  lower conversion rates than average furthermore product images have  higher conversion rates than those without and animated ads have a  higher conversion rate and ads with a logo placed in the lower left corner have  higher conversion rates than those with a logo placed anywhere else some might look at the data and conclude that it overprescribes creative opportunities but we think the opposite is true the data illuminates what has worked well in the past but it doesn’t limit the discovery of what might work in the future one of the best benefits of programmatic is that it enables affordable and fast realworld testing of literally any idea or hypothesis you can imagine it opens possibilities—it doesn’t close them may    britain’s first digital election have the major parties missed a trick today britain’s are going to the polls in what may be the closest and hardest to predict election that the country has ever seen throughout the long campaign public opinion polls seemed to have barely moved one way or the other what could the major and minor political parties have done differently to push the vote in their favour and win over undecided voters preparing for            new research on us voter behaviour produced by rocket fuel  indicates that digital advertising is indeed playing a bigger role than ever on the outcomes of elections and has emerged as a key way to create awareness and influence voters for political campaigns however when looking back on the uk’s first truly digital and socialmedialed general election campaign this research also indicates that the optimal time for political parties to influence floating voters ended around a month ago since the  election digital has moved up the political agenda in the uk as british political parties have started to take digital marketing more seriously the labour party signed up obama election winners blue state digital david cameron took to the world of twitter the liberal democrats used geotargeting on their website and richard desmond’s £m donation to ukip was reportedly earmarked for boosting the party’s online presence the influence of online advertising strategic online posters celebrity selfies on social media and even the somewhat surprising emergence of milifandom should perhaps not be dismissed the research has found that in the us  of floating voters cast their ballot as a result of seeing an online advertisement the research report “driving swing state voter activity through advertising” which studied  registered voters in colorado florida illinois north carolina and wisconsin demonstrated that voters had high ad recall and were behaviourally influenced by the timing and messaging of digital political marketing it suggests that half of key floating voters’ minds can be swayed with effectively targeted and personally persuasive online advertising up to two weeks before voting day effective online campaigns with targeted persuasive messages served up to the correct audience will still influence  of undecided voters up to  days before polling day yet once there are less than seven days to go it is too late for a party to do anything meaningful to influence a still undecided voter and the effectiveness of online advertising is dramatically reduced with one week to go have parties done enough with  marginal seats in the uk needing only a  change in behaviour for them to switch allegiance the party that has utilised effective online marketing campaigns targeted at voters in these constituencies could have helped provide a deciding factor in these last couple of weeks of the campaign digital advertising is playing a bigger role than ever on the outcomes of elections and has emerged as a key way to create awareness and influence voters for political campaigns knowing when voters are most susceptible to persuasive messaging allows political parties to better target swing voters sitting on the fence traditionally many campaigns spend a lot of money in the last few days before decision day however this research shows that political parties seeking to persuade voters to take a particular course of action should begin spending their media budgets well in advance of election day and focus on gotv initiatives within the final four weeks of an election campaign indeed the lessons learned from the general election campaign may well see a huge shift in how political parties deliver their messages in future may    chappie shows how ai will help us all in years to come of the many major hollywood movies that we’ve seen appear lately on the subject of ai i feel that chappie staring hugh jackman understands the positive side of the developing relationship between humans and machines better than anything we’ve seen so far chappie set in the future where an ai powered police robot learns to think for himself and assist his human comrades  stephen hawking elon musk and bill gates have all recently issued statements that we should be very afraid of the dangers of ai and the ways it could endanger humans employment prospects and chance for a happy and fulfilled life this pessimistic view of burgeoning new technologies is nothing new it can be seen throughout the history of development of communications and computing technology that each new departure is met with fear and criticism however the reciprocal relationships portrayed in chappie is not such a far flung idea as it may seem ai is already helping humans in a variety of professions including our own world of marketing and advertising new technology is helping us constantly create new innovations and data so much data in fact that to effectively sort through this all and make effective decisions that help us in the world of marketing we need to enlist the help of our robot helpers ai is able to look at a customer’s past behaviour online and process where they have previously spent a lot of time online and what has been of interest to them this means looking at their most visited sites how long they spend there who they follow on twitter what brand pages they like and interact with on facebook and what their recent purchases have been on leading ecommerce sites  these data points can then be analysed to make sure advertisements are reaching shoppers at the points of influence and helping them on their way to their path of purchase ai is here to stay and as movies like chappie are starting to show its role is going to be more helpful than hurtful march    follow me on twittermy tweets follow dominic trigg on wordpresscom categoriescategories select category ad exchanges ad fraud ad networks ad
