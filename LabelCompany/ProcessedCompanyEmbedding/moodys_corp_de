breaking newsmiway insurance incurs blf’s wrath facts you should know business state of the economy sa’s junk status could last for at least  years  post by chika udeh july   advertisement not minding all that has been said about the future of the south african economy and how important it is for all hands to be on deck to bring it back to its feet an economist said the current south africa’s junk status will last for not two four but for at least six years a lot has been predicted about what lies ahead concerning the state of the south african economy since it was downgraded to junk status and later recessed lesiba mothata who is the executive chief economist for alexander forbes investment solutions predicts that the south african credit rating which was downgraded earlier this year would stay until  but added that this wasn’t ‘the end of the world’ as there’s light at the end of the tunnel for the country read also fitch rates sa experts say sa’s downgrade is not the end of the world sa’s credit ratings was downgraded to junk status by three rating agencies after they expressing concern over the political upheavals government debt and in particular the sacking of mr gordhan and replacing him with malusi gigaba speaking about people’s reaction to the announcements by moodys and sp rating agencies mothata said “people ask if sa is more like zimbabwe or more like venezuela yet we have seen the spectacular bond performance and globally it looks like there will be continued demand for emerging market debt “i am not saying there are no risks there are for instance concerns about left leaning policy here” he said he is confident that south africa can negotiate the current economic conditions but they have to take advantage of growth in subsaharan africa to help them restore confidence in the economy “don’t have an exaggerated view of the downgrades or its economic outcome i have a glass half full approach sa policy error risks are substantial and it has become a confidence issue now yet i believe sa can weather the storm” he said adding that it is likely that the economic status will receive a further downgrade in december but urged people to keep a calmer perspective the economist however noted that the stateowned entities including the south african airline saa and eskom are causing the most stress to the economy as their ill performances undermined investor confidence privatisation is however not the answer especially not for eskom who could “make electricity very expensive he said six years seems a long time to wait for economic improvement but somehow the rand has survived a barrage of setbacks in  this is our biggest source of optimism read also sa downgrade edward zuma close allies celebrate sa’s downgrade meanwhile some analysts who have been exploring the longterm consequences of a credit downgrade for south africa disagree with finance minister malusi gigaba that its effects will be minimal on ordinary citizens for the analysts the down grade means that investors both domestic and foreign will require more in terms of interest it also means that government will have less money to spend on basic services and yet our government has committed to a lot of basic services provision especially to the poor which means in all likelihood taxes will go up that means that inflation will go up interest rates aren’t going to come down so you’ll continue to pay more on your credit card debt and car loans than you would have if we had a stable economy downgrading  sa to junk would increase south africa’s debtservicing costs seen at rbillion in the  fiscal year thus paying higher debt costs would mean less money for critical services such as housing education and sanitation which could incite more protests that have rocked towns

press release coverage on rating actions that moodys has taken on issuers rating methodologies our rating methodologies describe the analytical framework rating committees use to assign ratings as set forth in the methodologies our methodologies are not intended to present an exhaustive treatment of all factors reflected in our ratings rather they describe the key qualitative and quantitative considerations that are usually most important for assessing credit risk in a given sector each rating committee applies its own judgment in determining whether or how to emphasize rating factors it considers to be of particular significance although most of our methodologies apply to a particular industry sector or class of issuers or transactions some describe our approach to analytical considerations that aren’t specific to any single sector typically these crosssector methodologies cover general creditrelated topics and can be used in conjunction with sectorspecific methodologies to assign ratings the methodology development group mdg develops and the methodology review group mrg reviews and approves our methodologies for all rating groups including sovereign financial

this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moodys corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k this mda contains forwardlooking statements see forwardlooking statements commencing on page  and item a risk factors commencing on page  for a discussion of uncertainties risks and other factors associated with these statements the company moodys is a provider of i credit ratings ii credit capital markets and economic related research data and analytical tools iii software solutions and related risk management services iv quantitative credit risk measures financial services training and certification services and v research and analytical services moodys has two reportable segments mis and ma mis the credit rating agency publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors additionally mis earns revenue from certain nonratingsrelated operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the asiapacific region as well as revenue from icras nonratings revenue the revenue from these operations is included in the mis other lob and is not material to the results of the mis segment the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets within its rda business ma distributes research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process including indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies and commentary on topical creditrelated events the rda business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores within its ers business ma provides software solutions as well as related risk management services the ps business provides research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs critical accounting estimates moodys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires moodys to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis moodys evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances contingencies goodwill and intangible assets pension and other retirement benefits utbs and stockbased compensation actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on managements judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable pursuant to asc topic  when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available third party evidence if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available the companys products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under asc topic  the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the companys control in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit  moodys  k table of contents the company determines whether its selling price in a multielement transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range or only having a limited sales history the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers however due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation andor customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe based on the selling price hierarchy established by asc topic  when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company will establish an esp esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives standalone sales prices of similar products percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service and customer segment and geography additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend the company reviews its determination of vsoe tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed in the mis segment revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed generally one year in the case of commercial mortgagebacked securities structured credit international residential mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities which was approximately  years on a weighted average basis at december   at december    and  deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately  million  million and  million multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data at december    and  accounts receivable

rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of november december and january products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either standalone or together in various combinations in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and nonsoftware deliverables revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the moodys  k  table of contents residual revenue to the delivered elements if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements in cases where software implementation services are considered essential and vsoe of fair value exists for postcontract customer support pcs once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software license and service revenue is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as implementation services are performed while pcs is recognized over the coverage period if vsoe of fair value does not exist for pcs once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining pcs coverage period if vsoe does not exist for pcs at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation revenue not recognized due to the absence of vsoe will be recognized on a cumulative basis accounts receivable allowance moodys records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue based on historical experience and current conditions such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance additionally estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account writeoffs are charged against the allowance moodys evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current aging status of customer accounts moodys also considers the economic environment of the customers both from an industry and geographic perspective in evaluating the need for allowances based on its analysis moodys adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts accordingly moodys results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and writeoffs under current conditions however significant changes in any of the above factors or actual writeoffs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the companys consolidated results of operations contingencies accounting for contingencies including those matters described in note  to the consolidated financial statements is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome in many cases the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties including governmental or judicial bodies the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosures represent managements best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may in the future adjust its associated liabilities for claims litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range in other instances where a loss is reasonably possible management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome andor the amount or range of loss but discloses the contingency if significant as additional information becomes available the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation regulatory governmental investigations and inquiries enforcement and similar matters and contingencies particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted on its competitive position or on its financial position results of operations or cash flows as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on its operations and financial condition however in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time the companys whollyowned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for workers compensation employment practices litigation employee medical claims and terrorism for which the claims are not material to the company in addition for claim years  and  the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims for matters insured by the companys insurance subsidiary moodys records liabilities based

first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the

moodys evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the company has six primary reporting units two within the companys ratings business one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moodys other ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rda ers fstc and maks the rda reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investororiented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process indepth research on major debt issuers industry studies economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools the ers reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry these products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis the fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services the maks reporting unit formerly known as copal amba provides research and analytical services copal amba was renamed moodys analytics knowledge services in december  the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a threestep impairment test approach at the reporting unit level in the first step the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist the company is not required to perform further testing if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach the companys accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years at july   the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units which resulted in no impairment of goodwill in january  there was a management change in the maks business as of the date of the filing of this form k a new operating and strategic plan for this reporting unit under the new management structure has not yet been completed based on all available information the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the maks reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount at december   a quantitative impairment assessment for the maks reporting unit will be performed in the first quarter of  upon the completion of revised financial projections under the new management structure which could result in a reduced fair value as compared to the july   fair value determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and appropriate comparable market metrics however as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from these estimates in addition the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units other assets and liabilities including applicable corporate assets are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units moodys  k  table of contents sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit the following

value of its reporting units excluding icra as of july   the date of each reporting units last quantitative assessment as icra is a publicly traded company in india the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization the fair value of each reporting unit excluding icra was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent

strategic plans expected longterm growth rates terminal values weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions
