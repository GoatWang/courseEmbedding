scourge of america’s economy isn’t the success of the  percent—quite the opposite the real problem is the government’s wellmeaning but misguided attempt to reduce the payoffs for success  four years ago edward conard wrote a controversial bestseller unintended consequences which set the record straight on the financial crisis of  and explained why us growth was accelerating relative to other highwage economies he warned that loose monetary policy would produce neither growth nor inflation that expansionary fiscal policy would have no lasting benefit on growth in the aftermath of the crisis and that illadvised attempts to rein in banking based on misplaced blame would slow an already weak recovery unfortunately he was right  now he’s back with another provocative argument that our current obsession with income inequality is misguided and will only slow growth further  using factbased logic conard tracks the implications of an economy now constrained by both its capacity for risktaking and by a shortage of properly trained talent—rather than by labor or capital as was the case historically he uses this fresh perspective to challenge the conclusions of liberal economists like larry summers and joseph stiglitz and the myths of “crony capitalism” more broadly  instead he argues that the growing wealth of most successful americans is not to blame for the stagnating incomes of the middle and working classes if anything the success of the  percent has put upward pressure on employment and wages conard argues that high payoffs for success motivate talent to get the training and take the risks that gradually loosen the constraints to growth wellmeaning attempts to decrease inequality through redistribution dull these incentives gradually hurting not just the  percent but everyone else as well  conard outlines a plan for growing middle and workingclass wages in an economy with a near infinite supply of labor that is shifting from capitalintensive manufacturing to knowledgeintensive innovationdriven fields he urges us to stop blaming the success of the  percent for slow wage growth and embrace the upside of inequality faster growth and greater

inequality faster growth and greater prosperity for everyonefrom the hardcover edition about the upside of inequality from the new york timesbestselling author of unintended consequences comes another bold and contrarian book by the man who famously defended capitalism and the one percent at the height of the occupy movement conventional wisdom says income inequality is rising and harmful to nearly everyone and the rich are to blame but as ed conard shows anyone who can produce a product valued by the entire economy will find his or her income growing faster than those who are limited by the number of customers they can serve such as schoolteachers plumbers doctors and lawyers consider taylor swift the current queen of pop who made  million in  she earns more because her audience is huge not because she takes anything away from the tens of millions of fans who happily pay for all those concert tickets itunes downloads and souvenir tshirts her ability to generate value can scale with the economy the same is true for others who improve the lives of millions like facebook founder mark zuckerberg and apple ceo tim cook the growing success of innovators doesn’t hurt the rest of the workforce in fact the opposite is true–their success increases the demand for our middle and working class labor challenging the arguments of liberal economists like paul krugman and joseph stiglitz conard reveals the truth about the income inequality panic and by drawing on a historical study of the ebbs and flows of our economy he proposes ways to grow the economy faster which will benefit everyone on the income spectrum also by edward conard see all books by edward conard also by edward conard see all books by edward conard also by edward conard see all books by edward conard about

misconceptions that distort our economic debates he debunks the myth that inequality is a conspiracy perpetuated by robber barons and sheds light on the complex economic phenomena that shape america’s success readers of all political persuasions will benefit from this highlyinformative book” —arthur brooks president of the american enterprise institute “this provocative new book by ed conard is a mustread for serious students of economic policy conard’s core thesis—that advancement in living standards is constrained by risk capital and properly trained talent—suggests an inequality borne of returns from innovation his solutions are sensible and all the more compelling in the context of this paean to risktaking” —glenn hubbard dean of columbia business school and former chairman of the council of economic advisers   “conard makes a fresh argument for the productive value of inequality which is that scarce entrepreneurial effort and risktolerant capital are the resources that are both most central to economic growth and most sensitive to the potential distortions imposed by taxation and regulation whether or not one accepts this argument it’s an argument well worth having” —david autor professor of economics massachusetts institute of technology   “i profoundly disagree with much of what is in conard’s book but respect the clarity with which he makes his case  agree or disagree this book can sharpen your thinking on critical economic issues making it a very valuable contribution” —larry summers former secretary of the treasury and director of the national economic council president emeritus harvard university   “ed conard puts forward a comprehensive explanation of the modern economy critics may dismiss it as a defense of the  percent but it’s much much more than that i rarely see economic analysis as insightful as this” —julian robertson founder of tiger management   “page after page ed conard challenges conventional wisdom about the causes of growing inequality the constraints to growth and the feasibility of commonly proposed solutions to advance a thoughtprovoking blueprint for growing middle and workingclass incomes in a world with an abundance of workers whether you agree or not this is serious thinking for serious thinkers” —mitt romney former governor of massachusetts related articles looking for more great reads download our spring
