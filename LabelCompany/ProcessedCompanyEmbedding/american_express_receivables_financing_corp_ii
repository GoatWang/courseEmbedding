access by using a convenience check available to transfer balances from other accounts or make other payments or from automated teller machines the american express credit card account was first offered in early  and branded as the optima card all american express credit card accounts are originated by centurion and are generated by direct mail solicitations and telemarketing to prospects offers are made to existing cardmembers having a credit history with a charge card account and to noncardmembers in addition centurion offers american express credit card accounts that are originated under affinity or cobranded programs between centurion and certain unaffiliated entities centurion also distributes unsolicited or takeone applications and runs print advertisements and radio and television advertisements for american express credit card accounts and has a toll free telephone number for requests for information and applications receivables are also generated by soliciting the transfer of account balances from competitors accounts optima line of credit accounts the optima line of credit account is an unsecured revolving line of credit that is offered as an additional benefit in association with certain approved cardmembers charge card accounts the optima line of credit accounts may be accessed by writing a check supplied to cardmembers by centurion by using a loan activator check available only to make payments on outstanding balances on the customers charge card account or to obtain cash from automatic teller machines the predecessor to the optima line of

solicitations to existing or prospective cardmembers for accounts on a pre approved credit basis and iii with respect to certain optima line of credit accounts purchases of accounts from other financial institutions providing lines of credit to cardmembers sign  travelextended payment option accounts the sign  travelextended payment option accounts are features currently associated with consumer charge card accounts although corporate charge card account holders may be offered this feature in the future prior to  all cardmembers had access to sign  travel accounts since  only qualified cardmembers who have been charge card account holders in good standing usually for at least one year have been invited to obtain a sign  travel account a cardmember may use the sign  travel account for certain travelrelated purchases and may access the sign  travel account by indicating to the travel product merchant or to trs the preference to have such travel items billed to the sign  travel account certain nontravelrelated charges may be allowed in the future in addition selected cardmembers are invited to enroll in the sign  travel express service that automatically bills eligible travel purchases to the cardmembers sign  travel account selected cardmembers may also use this feature to repay over time certain other designated charges currently this capability is

of time beginning in the later half of  some sign  travelextended payment option accounts became a feature of a multifunctional product offered by centurion such product consists of a payinfull feature for purchasing merchandise and one or more interestbearing revolving credit features including the sign  travelextended payment option it is anticipated that in addition to the receivables generated by the sign  travelextended payment option accounts the receivables generated by such other revolving credit features may in the future be conveyed to the trust this conversion may continue in the future underwriting and authorization procedures american express credit card accounts centurion uses two types of approval processes in determining whether to open an american express credit card account the preapproved process and the full application process the preapproved process involves determining in advance that a person will qualify for an american express credit card account centurion determines the minimum credit criteria required for a consumer to receive an offer these criteria were developed from proprietary risk models and commercially available risk evaluation scores credit bureaus provide centurion with the credit attributes scores and encrypted names and addresses of persons passing the minimum criteria centurion then screens out persons with prior centurion delinquencies and incidents of fraud and uses its proprietary risk and response modeling to finalize the solicitation pool centurion may also determine the eligibility of such persons to receive an offer based on such persons activities eg membership in a rewards program holding credit cards magazine or newspaper subscriptions and college enrollment the full application process is used for evaluation of unsolicited applications the primary sources of these applications are the inbound telemarketing program that features a tollfree telephone number and on a limited basis the american express take one boxes located in a variety of public establishments the full application process entails receiving a completed application evaluating the application using proprietary scoring models and credit bureau information screening out prior centurion delinquencies and incidents of fraud and verifying that the information on the application is both accurate and provided by the true applicant in addition to the credit review performed in connection with origination of accounts centurion has established credit authorization procedures applicable to american express credit card account utilizations utilizations of such american express credit card accounts are subject to authorization at the time of such utilization based upon the cardmembers past spending and payment activity and personal resources certain utilizations such as purchases indicating outofpattern spending initial utilizations on new accounts and charges to noncurrent accounts are subject to closer credit scrutiny the credit limits for american express credit card accounts generally range from  to  although the credit limits applicable to certain american express credit card accounts may be as high as   optima line of credit accounts optima line of credit accounts are no longer actively solicited they had been underwritten pursuant to procedures similar to those for american express credit card accounts authorization based on cardmembers past spending and payment behavior and personal resources occurs at the time of utilization sign  travelextended payment option accounts centurion extends the right to access a sign  travelextended payment option account to qualified cardmembers after they have been charge card account holders in good standing for one year there is no preset spending limit on these accounts however utilizations of the sign  travelextended payment option account are subject to approval through a credit authorization process similar to credit authorization procedures applicable to the american express credit card account billing and payments the accounts owned by centurion have various billing and payment structures including various annual fees and monthly finance charges each account holder is subject to an agreement governing the terms and conditions of the american express credit card account the optima line of credit account and the sign  travelextended payment option as applicable pursuant to each such agreement centurion reserves the right to change or terminate any terms conditions services or features of the account including increasing or decreasing monthly finance charges fees or minimum payments or changing the order in which payments made by account holders will be applied to satisfy amounts owing by account holders such changes are subject to the requirements of applicable laws and to certain limitations in the pooling and servicing agreement described herein any announced increase in the formula used to calculate the annual percentage rate or apr or other change making the terms of an account more stringent generally becomes effective on a designated future date american express credit card accounts generally an american express credit card account holder is charged i an annual fee for the optima card of  to  ii finance charges on merchandise and services purchased and on cash advances based on variable aprs equal to the prime rate as published in the wall street journal plus a spread ranging from  to  depending on the cardmembers tenure spending and payment patterns and type of product and a fixed default rate of  some products have fixed standard aprs currently ranging from    iii amounts payable for certain uses of the american express credit card including the standard network fee of  on cash advances obtained through an automated teller machine with a  minimum charge and a  fee for obtaining american express travelers cheques and iv if applicable insufficient funds fees late fees overlimit fees and other fees american express credit card accounts are billed by centurion on a cycle basis generally american express credit card account holders must make a minimum payment equal to the greater of a  or if the balance is less than  such balance or b th of the new balance plus any amount which is past due payments on the american express credit card accounts are currently generally applied in order of application to balances in respect of finance charges and fees cash advances and merchandise and services optima line of credit accounts billing and payment for optima line of credit accounts are the same as for credit card accounts  sign  travelextended payment option accounts there are no annual fee or other fees imposed for the use of the sign  travelextended payment option accounts except for a monthly finance charge based on an apr on the outstanding balance on the sign  travelextended payment option accounts the apr for the sign  travelextended payment option account balances is a variable rate equal to the prime rate plus  sign  travelextended payment option accounts not in good standing are assessed interest at a fixed apr of  the sign  travelextended payment option accounts are billed by centurion on a cycle basis at the same time as the obligors charge card account generally sign  travelextended payment option account holders must make a monthly minimum payment equal to the greater of a  or if the balance is less than  such balance or b th of the new balance plus any amount which is past due currently payments made on the charge card or sign  travelextended payment option accounts are generally applied first to past due sign  travelextended payment option account balances second to past due charge card account balances third to current sign  travel extended payment option account minimum payments fourth to current charge card account balances and finally to outstanding sign  travelextended payment option account balances each minimum monthly payment is applied first to finance charges and then to the appropriate principal balance designated in the preceding sentence after the incorporation of a sign  travelextended payment option accounts into the multifunctional product referred to under  generalsign  travelextended payment option accounts above it is expected that payments made on such product shall be applied first to the pay infull feature and then to the revolving features it is expected that the lower ratebearing features will be paid off prior to the higher ratebearing features collection efforts efforts to collect delinquent american express credit card accounts optima line of credit accounts and sign  travelextended payment option accounts are made by centurion and collection agencies and attorneys retained by centurion under current practice centurion includes a request for payment of overdue amounts on all billing statements upon delinquency centurion uses its proprietary risk evaluation systems to determine the appropriate collection strategy account holders whom centurion considers a high risk may be contacted by either a letter or a telephone call when the account becomes delinquent or sooner based on a number of factors including the account holders tenure and the amount owed in relation to prior spending and payment behavior an account is generally considered to be delinquent if the minimum payment specified in the account holders most recent billing statement is not received by the next statement cycle date if centurion determines that the account holder is unable to pay the outstanding balance the account is pre emptedie the card is cancelled credit privileges are revoked and more intensive collection action is initiated for all other account holders credit privileges are generally cancelled no later than  days from initial billing for both the preempted accounts and those reaching the day status attorney demand letters may also be sent if an account remains delinquent it may be sent to collection agencies who continue with telephone calls letters and telegrams legal action may be instituted centurion may enter into arrangements with account holders to extend or otherwise change payment schedules to maximize collections in the future centurion may sell its rights to certain collections to collection agencies  generally it is centurions practice to cause the receivables in an account to be charged off no later than the date on which such account becomes six contractual payments past due ie approximately  days from initial billing although chargeoffs may be made earlier in some circumstances such as confirmed bankruptcies the credit evaluation servicing chargeoff and collection practices of centurion
