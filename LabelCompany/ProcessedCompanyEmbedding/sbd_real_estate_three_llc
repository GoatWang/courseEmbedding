previous article top  real estate agents in richmond next article free investment property pro forma software development investing selling buying about us our philosophy our team  richmond va realtors careers contact us carter snipes december   below is a guest blog post from steven mcdonnough who is a financial consultant that we work with his article clearly outlines the benefits of owning any rental property in an llc many investors don’t put their properties into an llc until they own several properties and for some clients there may be reasons not to but steven makes a good case for the need to do so even for just one property many of our client’s in the richmond virginia area who use snipes properties for property management services aren’t putting their single family rental property into an llc because of the perceived extra cost but i believe anyone with a rental property should consult their cpa  attorney or financial consultant and find out if the benefits outweigh the extra cost what are your thoughts read the article and leave a comment below looking for a good real estate investing software try rehabvaluator and rentalvaluator we recommend it to our clients ———— should i put my rental property in an llc personal v entity owned real estate investment properties investment property is usually defined as real estate that is primarily purchased to buy and sell for a profit in the future or to produce rental income however there are several factors to take into account when deciding to purchase an investment property understanding the many components of investment property ownership can avoid a lot of headaches down the road many investors with real estate investment properties own them personally a more prudent way to own real estate for investment purposes is to transfer ownership to a limited liability company llc this method not only protects it’s ownermember’s personal assets  cash equity in real estate primary residence investment accounts retirement accounts etc – from litigation but it also allows for flexible profit distribution among their members legal benefits the primary reason to form an llc is for the legal protection it offers if the owner has a personal creditor the creditor generally cannot make a claim on the property owned by the llc or other corporate entity should any tenants their guests or anyone on the property sustain any injuries and if the property is owned in the client’s name the owner’s personal assets are at risk example an owner has a rental property that is occupied by a young couple they have a holiday party and one of their guests falls down stairs and is hospitalized the guest sues the owner for his injuries stating the stairs were hazardous if the guest successfully wins the claim against the owner any judgment in excess of the liability insurance can be satisfied with the owner’s personal assets tax benefits from a tax perspective an llc formed with two or more members is classified as a “passthrough” company a “passthrough” means its income is passed through to its owners and claimed on those owners’ individual tax returns hence it is subject only to capital gains rates on the ownership shares of the member and not to corporate capital gains taxes therefore there is no double taxation llcs with just one ownermember however are taxed as a sole proprietorship and no separate tax return is required actual tax dollars saved from holding real estate in an llc opposed to personally holding the properties is zero as of  if you own income property and actively participate in the management of the property and your adjusted gross income is less than  you can write off up to  in rental losses the amount of rental losses that you can write off is proportionately phased out between  and  for example if your adjusted gross income is  you can write off  in rental losses in the year of the loss if your adjusted gross income is  or more you cannot write off any rental losses on your tax return in the year of the loss also remember that although the loss is disallowed for that particular tax year it is not completely lost when you sell your income property you can writeoff any unused rental losses that have accumulated while you have owned the property want a great software program to help analyze your real estate deals check out this program from daniil kleyman of true vision analytics i use both of his programs rentalvaluator and rehabvaluator they are very detailed but still pretty easy to use i recommend the premium version for all of the upgraded reporting and using the tutorials which will show you things like a cash out refi analysis also his flipping version rehabvaluator has a formula that calculates the ideal acquisition price for any flip deal so you never overpay for a property estate planning benefits the formation of a llc for the purpose of holding investment real estate has estate planning advantages as well it allows for the transfer of ownership in the property in a more seamless manner than if personally owned in many circumstances property owners wish to gift certain percentages of their real estate to children or other family members for real estate not held in an llc this process can require many trips to the county courthouse to update deeds that will require changes every time percentages of ownership change in cases where real estate is owned in an llc the ownermembers can simply issue membership certificates to the child or family member and no changes need be made to the deed with the county whether you own twenty properties or one owning them personally can be a major liability all of your hard work and planning that lead to the ability to own real estate could be wiped out with one misfortune hopefully the insight provided in this article has helped you better understand the benefits of forming an llc and provided you with perspective on the pros and cons of ownership structures when purchasing property for investment purposes if you have any questions about buying or selling investment properties feel free to email your questions to

an llc and the rental property goes under foreclosure what does the llc protect me from thank you november   at  pm reply carter snipes it depends if you signed for the loan personally most banks make borrowers sign a personal guarantee even if the property is titled in an llc november   at  am reply sam as far as i know banks will only give loans to your personally not your llc march   at  pm reply carter snipes lenders will make loans to commercial development groups in the name of the entity these are generally called “nonrecourse loans” because if the project defaults the owners of the business entity or llc are not held financially responsible generally the group has many years of experience deep financial backing and the lender has a sophisticated understanding of the project’s likely success specifically there are hud loans and vhda loans in virginia for large mixedincome multifamily development projects that offer nonrecourse financing community banks will give loans without personally signing to businesses that have operating history long running business credit or dun  bradstreet ratings but they typically we will want collateral nearly equal to the amount of the loan for example equipment inventory or other real estate assets also the sba has a loan program called  specifically for commercial real estate purposes these loans are generally for businesses to buy buildings factories etc but from the standpoint of residential real estate investors you are going to have to personally guarantee any property you get a loan for march   at  am reply denis l if i do not have an llc but i already rented one of my properties is it too late to get an llc… if not what do you suggest… november   at  pm reply carter snipes yes you should be able to put the title into the name of an llc at any time you just need to hire a real estate attorney to change the title and record it for you but if you got the loan in your personal name it will not provide you with any protection from loan default but it can offer some protection in the event that you are sued november   at  am reply denis l i think i will be fine not changing any of the title at the moment because it will incur more expenses at the moment my main goal though is to protect my family and personal assets from any event in which my tenants would attempt to sue me… in this case once i get my llc it will bounce there correct also if i already have a signed contract with my tenants in which reflect my personal name i did this a few months ago how do i go about changing that to an llc do i break the contract and create a new one which type of llc would you recommend if i only have  property for rent sole proprietorship or partnership my wife and i perhaps … thank you very much in advance… you guys are the best november   at  am reply carter snipes your attorney can draft an addendum to the lease that changes the lease to the llc in terms of which type of llc you might want to check with your accountant or attorney that mostly depends on how you file your taxes glad i could help november   at  am reply carina it depends on eatxcly how long ago you purchased your current home fnma fannie mae will acknowledge you purchase of the existing home and in some states it must be over a year ago also most lenders will require a comp rent schedule on the current home as well as you would have to have  equity in your current home in order to use if as a rental home with rental income maybe you can carry both payments i work in the industry and it really is different state by state good luck january   at  am jane mcdonald hi if a husband and wife are on a deed of a building that they now want to put in a llc they are creating and that will both listed as equal members  can they put that building into the llc without changing the deed and incurring the transfer taxes december   at  pm tim pori hello steven if i create an llc naming my self and by brother as owners of an llc for use as as a pass through entity to avoid commingling of funds but do not actually place the properties in the llc will i lose the right to depreciate the property i plan to ask my cpa to prepare the returns for the year and then my brother and i will each be responsible for our share of the taxes because the property is still in my name i plan to reimburse my brother for the depreciation is this possible december   at  pm reply l hanf i have one rental property that i always have a paper loss on however given my income i cannot take it as a loss on my ordianry income and in fact it’s part of my agi that subjects me to amt if i were to create a llc or s corp for that one rental property could that then show as a zero on my  and avoid the impact that is having as part of my agi before deductions and amt january   at  pm reply james stroud hello the article is well written and had plenty of good information over the last  months i have gone from  to  investment properties all in my personal name i probably should have done it earlier but in terms of estate planning and mitigating my risk – i believe i should put them into an llc possibly  my concern is that when i transfer the houses into the llc mortgage companys will be notified via lawyer that the loan may be ‘calledin’ – i need to avoid that the loans were set up as investments properties any thoughts or coments on the likelyhood of the loans being called in regards james january   at  pm reply carter snipes in my experience the lender does not generally call the loan as long as it is current january   at  pm reply thomas phan carter if only if the lender call the loan due when property transferred to the llc what could be an appropriate action for the owner just simple transfer back to owner name to avoid loan due thanks november   at  am reply michael mattera james i would like some advice from you if you care to help out someone starting out currently llc with  property thanks michael matteraandassociatesgmailcom may   at  am reply chuck does moving the property into an llc require a sale and closing if not does it come off of my personal credit report if it is in the llc or is the important point whether i have signed the loan or not thanks january   at  pm reply carter snipes changing the deed and title to the property does require a “closing” but not a “sale” no money needs to change hands a closing attorney just needs to change the title and file it with the court it would not “come off your credit report” in most cases unless you refinance the loan however most lenders require you to personally guarantee a real estate loan so even if you put the property in an llc you are still personally on the loan and it will show up your credit january   at  am reply mary west a friend of mine bought a house in her name for just under  then the  months later put it into her llc company name and has it on the market for  is that all ok to do january   at  pm reply carter snipes it depends if she got a loan for the k or if she paid cash if you buy a property in your personal name and get a loan in your personal name changing the title to an llc does not remove you from the loan january   at  am reply lee i’m buying a multifamily property it’s only four bed units k a lender said the loan terms will be more expensive if i put it in an llc instead of borrowing as the sole proprietor so i obviously want the cheapest terms plus i once had an attorney tell me that if i carried enough insurance then having an llc isn’t necessary for protection your thoughts thanks february   at  pm reply carter snipes if a building is over  units then you have to get commercial financing anyway so the rate change isn’t that big of a deal in those cases when your dealing with single family rentals or multifamily under  units residential rate terms are generally much better and they typically allow for  year amortization which some commercial loan products do not as far as the issue with having enough insurance i’m not  sure but i do know that the idea of having the property in an llc as the article discusses is to shield any personal assets you might have from any risk or liability that the rental property might incur i had a client whose tenant fell off a balcony and was seriously injured now it wasn’t so bad that it maxed out their insurance coverage but i could imagine a situation like that where someone might have died and the lawsuit was greater than the coverage most people get in that kind of situation an llc would have created a potential shield from them coming after your personal assets february   at  pm reply np you mentioned that you still have to personally guarantee the loan even if you transfer the deed given that scenario is very common are you still shielded from liability you mentioned a couple of time above that you were somewhat shielded can you please elaborate february   at  am reply carter snipes i advise everyone to speak with an attorney and an accountant to review their own situation but generally the llc shields the owner from “liability and lawsuits” but not from the debt so if a tenant gets hurt in a property the llc can help to protect the owner’s personal assets from being brought into the lawsuit but an llc does not protect against foreclosure short sale or other defaults of the loan or loan payments february   at  pm reply mike i moved to va over a year ago and rented a house for my family to live in we were unable to sell our house in mn so we rented it out now we are looking to purchase a home in va and i’m wondering if putting my house in mn into an llc will increase my purchasing power on a home in va do mortgage companies treat the rental income and expense differently for investment properties held in an llc february   at  pm reply carter snipes probably not because the lender will probably still make you personally guarantee both loans it would lower your debttoincome ratio to put either property in an llc and give you more purchasing power it just helps to reduce your liability february   at  am reply aisha c great article very informative and helpful thanks for posting february   at  pm reply robert l without going into all the messy details i own one home that i live in and two others that are now rentals the loans on the rentals were originally entered into as primary residence loans if i make a move to put the rentals intoman llc will the banks make me do something like refinance as investment properties and what would that mean to me thanks in advance february   at  pm reply a sirnuri my partner and i purchased an investment property on cash and now we plan to rent it out we have a llc registered in both our names what should be our next steps transfer the deed from our names to llc can we apply for a tax id for the llc or simply what additional things will be needed for tax purposes should we open a joint business account at a bank where all the rent gets deposited in llc’s name any help will be appreciated february   at  pm reply carter snipes you are on the right track yes to all of your questions you should also get a good cpa and attorney as part of your investing team they are critical february   at  am reply lewis c hello i recently bought a rental property with a friend we are both on the loan and have  ownership each it is only a k property would you recommend creating an llc in this case if so what cost should we expect to pay thank you february   at  pm reply carter snipes generally i think having a simple llc when dealing with partners is always the best way to go if gives the protection we have been talking about in this forum in terms of your assets and liability but more importantly the operating agreement of the llc can spell out unforeseen eventualities like what happens if one partner wants to sell and the other doesn’t or what happens if one partner gets divorced or dies do both partners have to agree on all property management and leasing decisions or is one partner tasked with management duties i think in your situation i would be looking for that type of structure for the llc a simple llc filing is usually not terribly expensive to do through your state corporation commission however having the kind of operating agreement like i am suggesting would require a lawyer but it’s probably worth the investment i’ve seen many investment property partnerships experience unforeseen events like i described february   at  am reply as i own a  unit rental property with my personal name i have registered a llc with the state can i rent the apt under the llc do i have to change the insurance policy with llc name as well my bank won’t allow me to change the ownership to llc what are my options please advise thanks february   at  pm reply carter snipes you would need to title the property in the name of your llc if your bank will not allow it then you can’t do it most banks will allow you to title the property in an llc but they require that you are still personally on the loan february   at  pm reply susan l robert l says february   at  pm without going into all the messy details i own one home that i live in and two others that are now rentals the loans on the rentals were originally entered into as primary residence loans if i make a move to put the rentals intoman llc will the banks make me do something like refinance as investment properties and what would that mean to me thanks in advance i am also in this same exact situation and been afraid to notify the bank since my rentals are no longer primary residences to me will i be forced to refinance both properties with a commercial loan march   at  pm reply carter snipes you should discuss with a good local real estate attorney in your area i don’t think the banks would call your loan or make you refinance but i’d speak with an attorney before doing it march   at  pm reply diana robertsusan i am in the same situation i alerted the banks that i am no longer living in those homes due to pcs i had to change my homeowner’s insurance but nothing else changed they will not make you refinance i have bofa and wells fargo mortgages april   at  pm reply scott miller i have one rental property owned by my llc which is mostly a building and home improvement business i was considering changing back to a sole proprietorship because of the expense of my accountant who charges much more to prepare my taxes for the llc since it is more complicated since the building business is slow i haven’t been making the money i used to make and cannot justify paying that bill my wife can do the tax work for a sole proprietorship also i had to evict some tenants due to nonpayment of rent and when i went to court the judge told me i had to be represented by an attorney and i couldn’t represent myself to pay for a lawyer would also be very expensive after reading your article i am thinking twice about going back to having a sole proprietorship mostly because of the legal protection the llc gives what are your thoughts on my situation would it be better for me to be a sole proprietor and just get better insurance march   at  am reply carter snipes many states require that llcs be represented by an attorney in court so yes that is a good point because that can raise your eviction costs if you are self managing your properties also i would not have your business and your rental property in the same llc if your business got sued they could go after your rental property that is the point of having an llc is keeping the assets separate if you only have one property and your business is slow it sounds like the expense of having  llcs is not worth it for you remember its not always worth the expense to have multiple llcs it depends on how much money is at risk in each venture march   at  pm reply rbayer in south carolina i know someone that created a holding company then an llc for his small business owned by the holding company when i asked him about that decision he said he did it because a holding company keeps his name and his social security number private but an llc is public accessible so on the llc for his small business it only shows his fed tax id he is worried about id theft and if he opens another small business that too will be an llc under the holding company now i own a duplex and i’m thinking of getting another or maybe a storage rental unit do you think this is a smart move for my situation that have more than one duplex or rental income… each under their own llc  whether or not they are in a holding company february   at  pm reply dbrook my business partner and i are purchasing two small apartment buildings we are getting them on separate contracts but the our llc is listed on the contracts as the purchaser is it possible for each of us to legally control our own property even though we wish to keep them under the llc property is in arkansas also what book keeping will the llc entail thanks in advance march   at  am reply carter snipes i can’t give you specific advise about arkansas but i believe you can own multiple properties in the same llc and have more than one member of the llc that has management control an llc does require a different tax filings i’d recommend you get a good local lawyer and cpa on your team to make sure you get the best advice for your state march   at  pm reply cfang i have  properties under my name one of them free and clear can i put them all under one llc or  separate one do i have to pay off the loan in order to put in an llc once i do that do i have to change the lease to reflect the llc as the landlord thanks march   at  pm reply neil my wife and i formed an llc our plan is to file schedule c along with our  return ny is now asking me what my federal tax election is choices are sole proprietor corporation partnership and other my wife and i file married jointly any advice on how i should reply to ny thanks  april   at  pm reply aws can members of an llc that owns a rental property rent the from the llc april   at  pm reply chank my husband and i own a duplex loan in our names then we went to the county courthouse to change the title into the llc’s name we had a bank account in the llc name and tenants were writing rent checks in the name of the llc but when we switched banks they said we needed an ein to open an account in the name of an llc we don’t have an ein because we are in wi marital property state and our llc is considered a “disregarded entity” so we don’t file separate llc taxes my question is should i get an ein in order to open a bank account or should i skip it and use our names on the account instead thank you in advance for your advice april   at

equity still fair market value less the principal amount of the loan since the bank will have the note perfected and the property will still have a lien what would my exposure be assuming a lawsuit occurred but the plaintiff could not prove i committed tort i am trying to make sure the plaintiff could not be awarded the asset but leave me on the hook for the adjoining liability thanks in advance for your help regards july   at  pm reply dawn i have two rental properties that i own and one property that is my primary residents with a loan i am interested in putting my  rentals into a new llc a friend suggested i also put my home into the llc i’m concern that if i default on my primary residents loan the llc would be held libiable i also wonder do i need to change the title on my rental property’s to reflect the llc name and how do i put the properties under the llc for protection so both rentals are identify as part as my llc and not my personal assets july   at  pm reply elaine does the llc need to be created in the same state where the property is located for example i own rental property in nevada but live in california should the llc be created in california or nevada thanks august   at  pm reply joanne petrosino my brothers have a llc on a building we own together they did not include me in the llc can i start an llc also to protect my assests august   at  am reply jeff k carter snipes is an expert in investment real estate thank u for your willingness to help and give advice buying my fatherinlaw’s  unit and trying to understand all this november   at  am reply gautam c thank you for the informative article i have a question i bought a property in the name of my llc for all cash if i now want to refinance and take in some debt to do renovations banks are saying that i would need to pull it out of the llc to close on the loan they also say that after the loan closes i can put it back into the llc does taking the property out and then putting it back in reduce the legal protection you get from an llc if something happens down the road thank you for any information you can share on this november   at  am reply tyann my husband and i have  rental properties all in  separate llc’s along with mortgages on all  and each llc has its own checking act for renters to deposit there is profit from rents and i want to start paying down mortgage on just one of the llc’s can i just write checks from one llc to another llc or would that cause problem if there was a law suit from one of the tenants and they prove that because we are moving monies from one llc to another that its not separate therefore all llc’s would be at risk january   at  am reply brian carter snipes you’re the man not only did you write a great article but you’ve been answering questions for  years thank you i own a house that is a rental along with my father who cosigned i’m listed first i need to extract equity from the house and would like to keep it as an investment but a cashout refi which seems to have an industrystandard  ltv leaves me a bit short can i form an llc borrow  ltv of fair market value against that via a new mortgage and buy the house from me and my dad then i can get the minimum that i need for my next investment i would pay off the existing mortgage in the process january   at  am reply carter snipes hi brian probably not changing the property into an llc doesn’t really change the financing options it’s just a way to protect your personal assets against being sued january   at  am reply corinne my husband and i have just transferred our rentals into llc’s and we’re trying to figure out which operating agreement to use the single membermanaged llc a managermanaged llc or a multiple membermanaged llc hopefully you can clarify this for us thanks january   at  pm reply carter snipes probably multiple member but it depends on the language in the agreement that’s a lawyer question 🙂 january   at  pm reply marjorie

llc or a scorp is it possible thanks january   at  pm reply adrian carter if i own a rental in my personal name can i file taxes for it under a different entity such as an llc or corporation thank you for your time january   at  pm reply caitlin hello – my husband and i are buying our first rental property in another state than we live we’re not sure what type of llc is best for us an if we should even both be listed as members the above article makes it seem there are more tax benefits to having one member vice multiple aditionally we’d like to hire a friend to manage the property and kno we need to generate a w for her to do so can llcs generate these any and all input would be very much appreciated thanks february   at  pm reply daniel hi if i have a property under my name and want to put the property under an llc can i do it what steps should i have to follow please let me know thanks february   at  pm reply ashley hi carter question for you – is there a reason you suggest llc over an scorp also would you suggest placing the company’s name under one person or two ie my name or both myhusband’s name thanks for your help february   at  pm reply carter snipes from my experience llc’s work well for passthrough entities from a tax standpoint so i like them when  or more investors are involved in a deal each investor’s profits from the entity simply pass through to their individual tax return scorps require most members to draw salary and pay payroll tax so you have potential double taxation i’m sure there are other reasons but attorneys and cpa’s that i deal with generally recommend llc’s for those reasons as always you should always consult a local attorney and cpa in your state february   at  pm reply rbayer does the passthru work for a one member llc  february   at  pm reply daniel how does having properties in a family trust affect an llc i own  rental properties is the cost for setting up an llc the same for one rental property as it is for three rental properties thank you i am eager to hear your response february   at  pm reply dan carter for someone that owns two rental properties would you recommend that two separate llcs be formed and one property be transferred to one llc and the other rental property be transferred to the separate llc to limit liability in case of lawsuit against llc thanks for your help dan february   at  am reply susan hi i recently purchased an investment property in california under my name only my husband has a llc and we are thinking about transferring the property to his llc the property was purchased on cash is this possible what is the procedure do we have to pay transfer tax  february   at  am reply carter snipes if you have no loan on the property it would be very simple you will need a local real estate attorney to complete the paperwork and as always your local attorney and accountant would need to answer any specific questions about your transaction because all states and localities are different good luck february   at  am reply will hi carter – can i create a single member llc and elect s corp to avoid self employment tax or would it still be better to have my wife on the llc as well thanks in advance for the response april   at  am reply bianca two questions regarding vacation rental property property is used  months out of the year for personal use other months for vacation
