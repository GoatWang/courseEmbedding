replacement osteoarthritis oa is a common orthopedic problem affecting  of the population half of them suffering from osteoarthritic changes in the hips the only therapy for hip oa that has been proven to significantly decrease pain for the patient is the implantation of a total prosthesis which means the replacement of both parts of the hip joint acetabulum and femoral head with prosthetic implants proper muscle function is crucial for the stabilization of the pelvis and early postoperative mobilization which is strongly associated with improved patient outcomes it is known that the poor functional outcome often seen following total hip replacement is particularly prevalent in older and overweight patients and the poor outcome is presumed to have a muscular basis it is our belief that cell therapies could significantly improve postsurgical outcomes for these patients by improving muscle regeneration critical limb ischemia  pluristem therapeutics inc pluristem therapeutics inc

short period of time such as could occur after the meltdown of a nuclear reactor or the detonation of a “dirty bomb” the acute signs and symptoms classically affect the hematologic gastrointestinal skin and central nervous systems the hematologic syndrome of ars is characterized by severe decreases in the numbers of platelets and red and white blood cells due to the destruction of the bone marrow progenitor cells which produce these cells low numbers of these cells can result in uncontrollable bleeding anemia severe infection and death plxr is being studied in collaboration with the us

mesenchymallike adherent stromal cells that are designed to be administered to patients without the need for tissue or genetic matching these cells release soluble biomolecules such as cytokines chemokines and growth factors which act in a paracrine or endocrine manner to facilitate healing of damaged tissue by stimulating the body’s own regenerative mechanisms plxpad plxpad cells respond to chemical distress signals from tissues that have been damaged by ischemia inadequate blood flow muscle trauma or inflammation by secreting a range of therapeutic proteins that trigger the body’s own repair mechanisms these secreted proteins drive the body to grow collateral blood vessels to bring oxygenated blood to ischemic tissue heal damaged muscle and dampen inflammation plxpad cells also modulate the immune system which plays a central role in the body’s response to injuries plxpad is being developed in clinical trials for critical limb ischemia via accelerated regulatory pathways in both europe and japan premarketing “pivotal” trials are expected to start in both regions in  two completed phase i trials of plxpad in critical limb ischemia produced positive results and a randomized doubleblind phase ii study has demonstrated the safety and potential efficacy of plxpad in treating muscle injury in the context of hip replacement surgery the cells are also being studied in an ongoing phase ii trial in intermittent claudication and are being evaluated for other indications including preeclampsia plxr plxr cells release a combination of therapeutic proteins in response to a damaged or poorly functioning hematopoietic system this system creates the blood cells that protect us from infection uncontrolled bleeding and anemia the product is currently in development to treat incomplete engraftment of transplanted hematopoietic cells and acute radiation syndrome ars the us national institutes of health’s niaid is initiating dose evaluation studies of plxr in ars as a basis for a potential premarketing trial in a large animal model positive data from that trial could allow pluristem to apply for approval of plxr in this indication using the animal rule regulatory
