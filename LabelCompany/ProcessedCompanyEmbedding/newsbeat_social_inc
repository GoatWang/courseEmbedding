were represented well in all positions especially as onair talent where diversity in appearance was valued really refreshing editing positions were repetitive but paid the bills and offer a good entry to this industry i learned a lot always a polite and respectful environment for women in my experience never saw anything untoward in almost two years a lot of my coworkers were millennials just out of college with little previous work experience imo not always wellprepared for a real working environment satisfied rater “ the ceo is extremely sexist he asked my coworkers to comment on a female colleagues legs and abs in front of the whole newsroom he also treats me like im a girl and pulls my hair very unsatisfied rater “ leave your feelings of selfworth at home and get ready to be
