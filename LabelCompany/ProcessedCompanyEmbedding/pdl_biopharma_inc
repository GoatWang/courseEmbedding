search better buy pdl biopharma inc vs johnson  johnson these two healthcare stocks have more differences than similarities find out which is the better pick right now cory renauer tmfangapples feb   at am biotech finance specialist pdl biopharma nasdaqpdli has been suffering a prolonged market thrashing thats driven its stock price down about  over the past three years over the same period johnson  johnson nysejnj stock has kept pace with the buoyant broadmarket sp  index if pdl biopharma selling has gone too far a turnaround could lead to marketbeating gains should investors ignore jjs relative safety in favor of the riskier value play lets have a closer look at these unique healthcare stocks to see which comes out ahead right now image source getty images arguments for pdl biopharma this company has had an extremely tough year until recently it was able to pay investors a juicy dividend with profit derived from patents covering some of the worlds bestselling drugs however the queen et al patent family expired at the end of  and revenue derived from the patent family plunged to just  million in the third quarter last year from  during the same period a year earlier pdl biopharma has made some progress reducing its dependence on the oncelucrative royalty stream from the queen patents but nowhere enough to offset the loss thirdquarter revenue came in at just  million for a  yearonyear decline for the period last july pdl biopharma committed  million to an equity stake in noden pharma and exclusive worldwide rights to a hypertension medication branded tekturna in the us and rasilez everywhere else in  the drug generated  million in sales while marketed by novartis although during the three months ended in september pdl recorded just  million in total product revenue investors will want to keep their eyes open for the first full quarter of tekturna sales achieving or surpassing the highwater mark set by the drugs previous owner could help the stock bounce back somewhat further ahead reinstatement of the dividend it scrapped last year could provide another boost arguments for johnson  johnson in many ways the worlds largest healthcare company is the polar opposite of pdl biopharma remicade is its bestselling product by a mile but the  billion in sales it generated last year comprised just  of the companys enormous top line in the quarters ahead investors will want to keep an eye on remicade sales late last year pfizer launched inflectra the first domesticallyavailable biosimilar version of the megablockbuster biosimilars have been digging into international sales of the drug for years but remicade generates the majority of its sales in the us at a  discount to remicades us list price inflectra will almost certainly pressure its sales the behemoth has a good chance of more than offsetting the losses with new products emerging from its latestage pipeline the company boasts three of the worlds  most highly valued drugs expected to reach pharmacy shelves this year the fda is reviewing applications for guselkumab as a potential new psoriasis treatment and the rheumatoid arthritis candidate sirukumab if approved the pair is expected to generate a  billion in combined annual sales by  a bit further out apalutamide is an interesting prostate cancer candidate that could add another  billion to jjs top line by  the company intends to submit applications for treatment of earlystage prostate cancer later this year running the numbers at its beatendown price of around  times trailing earnings pdl biopharma looks insanely cheap if successful commercialization of tekturna restores some confidence in the companys otherwise dismallooking future there could be some gains ahead before you jump at pdls stock though you should consider the  million in convertible notes it issued late last year to refinance an existing debt in a nutshell those notes could be converted into shares that would heavily dilute your share of any future profits driving the stock much lower image source getty images johnson  johnson shares offer a nice  dividend yield at recent prices that you can reasonably expect to continue marching upwards well into your retirement its been  years since the company went more than a year without raising its dividend payment and its managed to increase adjusted earnings for an outstanding  consecutive years at  times trailing earnings shares of johnson  johnson arent exactly cheap but theyre far less likely to lead to losses over the long run thats makes it a much better buy than pdl
