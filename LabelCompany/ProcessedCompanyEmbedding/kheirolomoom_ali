continuous delivery toolchain success by ali kheirolomoom october    am if you didn’t see the news yesterday our friends at cloudbees the enterprise jenkins company announced further strengthening of their partner program to delivery continuous delivery success to software development and it organizations around the world it was a pleasure to be quoted in the release because i firmly believe that continuous delivery isn’t about any one particular process you automate or tool you buy instead to achieve continuous delivery speed and quality you need to seamlessly connect your processes and tools into a devops toolchain that eliminates bottlenecks manual steps and errors of course i believe that our deployment automation and release management solutions are critical components in that toolchain but those products need to plugin easily and work collaboratively with adjacent tools such as sccm eg dimensions cm pvcs subversion git continuous integration eg jenkins and infrastructure configuration management eg cfengine puppet chef if you are near chicago san francisco or washington dc in the next month i invite you to come to one of the continuous delivery summits or jenkins user conferences we are sponsoring with cloudbees to learn more about this subject and see these products working together for devops success  i also invite you to attend our next devops drivein webcast on october th with mark burgess founder of cfengine on the future of configuration management ali “we are excited to partner with cloudbees to deliver worldclass continuous delivery automation for the world’s largest and most important companies” said ali kheirolomoom senior vice president of rd serena software “serena provides application deployment automation and release process management solutions that seamlessly integrate with jenkinspowered cloudbees products whether in the cloud or onpremise to enable our mutual customers to speed up application delivery increase software quality and most importantly better respond to the demanding needs of their customers”  comments click here to readwrite comments tags devops homepage it operations release automation release management
