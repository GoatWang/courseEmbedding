presented with the challenge of identifying sparrows and other grassland birds many people prefer to simply refer to them as lbjs or little brown jobs identification is particularly challenging in the winter when these birds are cryptically colored are not singing identifiable songs and prefer to respond to disturbances by hiding in the grass or running along the ground like little mice however after several years of conducting research on habitat use by and effects of grazing on wintering grassland birds i can tell you that the effort is well worth the struggle holding a bairds sparrow ammodramus bairdii in the hand with the warm ochre color washing over its face crown and nape or managing a good look at a crouching chestnutcollared longspur calcarius ornatus male coming into breeding plumage in the split second before he bursts into the air from under your feet is worth all the frustrations of unknown sparrows in between related projects title completion year investigator
