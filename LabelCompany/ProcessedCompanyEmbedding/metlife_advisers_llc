life insurance expand all collapse all what is life insurance and why do i need it a death in the family is not only emotionally devastating it can also take a tremendous toll on the future financial security of a family suddenly without the deceased’s income paying the mortgage or providing for a childs college education may become much more difficult    those who buy life insurance do so to help ensure their loved ones are taken care of financially life insurance is a promise by an insurance company to pay those who depend on you a sum of money upon your death in return you make periodic payments called premiums premiums can be based on factors such as age gender medical history and the dollar amount of the life insurance you purchase in the event of your passing life insurance provides money directly to the individuals you select your beneficiaries who can use the money as they see fit including replacing lost income covering basic living expenses paying household debts estate taxes and funeral expenses funding a child’s education supplementing retirement savings what kinds of life insurance can i get at work life insurance comes in two main types – term and permanent – which may both be available through your workplace term life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones for a specified period of time – usually from one to  years if you stop paying premiums the insurance stops term policies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy but they do not build cash value they may also give you the option to port that is you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company generally you should consider a term life insurance policy to get valuable coverage at an affordable price help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses supplement a permanent policy permanent life insurance policies do not expire they are intended to protect your loved ones permanently as long as you pay your premiums some permanent life insurance policies accumulate cash value that means the value of the policy will grow each year taxdeferred until it matches the face value of the policy the cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals and can be used for a variety of purposes this type of plan is typically portable so coverage can continue if employment terminates  consider a permanent insurance policy if you want protection for life payments that stay the same each year to put additional money into the policy on a taxfavored basis cash value you can use while you are living what are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work getting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family if your employer offers a group plan consider signing up for advantages that may include competitive group rates guaranteed issue meaning you can get a certain amount of coverage without answering health questions or taking a medical exam convenient payroll deductions easy access to enrollment and educational tools that can help you make the right decisions about the type and amount of insurance that’s right for you the confidence of knowing that your employer has reviewed and selected the plan all you have to do is sign up and sometimes enrollment is automatic how much life insurance do i need while you won’t be able to pinpoint the amount you’ll need to the penny you can make a sound estimate  your goal should be to develop a life insurance plan that following your death will allow your family to live comfortably without your economic contribution also consider the effect of inflation over time the amount needed for retirement or college  years from now is likely to be significantly higher than today to estimate the amount of life insurance your family would need first calculate everything you now provide for your family including salary benefitshealth insurance k and retirement savings personal services you perform for your family such as child care cooking home maintenance etc then subtract your personal expenses including annual spending on personal needs such as food clothing entertainment etc how much does life insurance cost life insurance through your workplace may be more affordable than you think in fact many people can get term life insurance coverage from a quality company for a surprisingly low price premiums are typically based on factors such as age sex height and weight health status including whether or not you smoke participation in highrisk occupations life insurance gets more expensive as you get older and the type of coverage you choose will also affect your premium rates for term insurance are typically lower while rates for permanent policies are typically higher does metlife offer an individual one year term life insurance product yes  metlife’s one year term products offer affordable protection when you require insurance for the short term these

specialized benefit resources at  and press  for new business what are the tax advantages of life insurance death benefits are generally received income taxfree by your beneficiaries in the case of permanent life insurance policies cash values accumulate on an income taxdeferred basis that means you would not have to pay income tax on any of the policy’s earnings as long as the policy remains in

advisers pushed to produce more restructuring puts two bds under one roof ups pressure to sell proprietary products oct     pm by darla mercado  zoom metlife inc is revamping its distribution group giving its two remaining brokerdealers higher required minimum production levels with the expectations of selling more proprietary products with fewer repsthe insurer is placing metlife securities inc new england securities inc and metlife resources a retirement services distributor under a new banner called the metlife premier client group as part of the restructuring the firm will further cut its adviser corps by  to  reps after eliminating about  since last year see also metlife adviser ranks thinning out fast after cuts“the goal for the end of  is about  to  advisers with an average of  in production” said paul lapiana senior vice president of metlife premier client groupin  metlife had  advisers with an average production of  per rep today that number is down to  with an average of  in production for each adviser advisers under the new structure will be expected to meet higher sales minimums last year brokers needed to generate  in production to make their minimum that number is now  — and of that at least  must come from proprietary products whether metlifes asset management platform or the sale of disability annuity or life insurance products “if someone doesnt have the  but theyve made  in proprietary product sales well allow them to make the minimum production requirement” mr lapiana saidthe requirement on proprietary product sales goes against the grain noted jonathan henschen a recruiter with henschen  associates llc “the whole direction of the industry is the opposite of that make everything available to the rep and leave it to them what to sell” he said “in the captive market many have opened up on things like mutual funds so you have multiple fund families available but for insurance many of the companies are still restrictive”mr henschen added that the  production minimum is a high hurdle for many of the brokers “a lot of those captive reps are in the  to  range so this will force out a lot of them” he saidoverall the revamp is supposed to result in an elite adviser force thats inclined more toward comprehensive financial planning rather than just selling products mr lapiana said the firms are adopting a client engagement model that is “similar to what you see with a certified financial planner framework”“its a focus on training and education” mr lapiana said “in the past the top advisers have always been a processdriven holistic planning group they take clients through a thoughtful dialogue understand their objectives help them accumulate for retirement and address risk management needs”he added “we find that a lot of our advisers at the lower tiers were going at it from a product perspective rather than a comprehensive planning approach” in addition to that higher training standard metlife wants more from its new recruits in the past the firm would recruit “a couple thousand inexperienced representatives in a year” and  who were experienced mr lapiana said from this point on the firm hopes to attract  to  inexperienced brokers and  to  veteran reps new advisers will be expected to work on teams and have access to guidance mentorship and client prospects from the more experienced advisersrecruits will be required to get their series  and  licenses as opposed to only their series   and life and health insurance licenses mr lapiana saidmr henschen noted that the additional licensing is what gives wirehouse reps an edge over insurance brokers many reps at insurance firms tend to only be series  licensed he added “metlife will have its work cut out for them” mr henschen said “this is going to be a long road”metlife has been through interesting times in may investmentnews reported that the insurer had cut its adviser force by about  reps in the past year — excluding the  brokers at walnut street securities and tower square securities the two metlife independent brokerdealers that were sold to cetera financial group in april  comments what do you think view comments please enable javascript to

ethics metlife investments department code of ethics april   amended january      section i metlife investments department insider trading policies and procedures    introduction this code of ethics sets forth the policies and procedures of metlifes investments department investments or the investments department regarding material nonpublic information and applies to transactions in accounts for which the investments department has daytoday investment management responsibility this code of ethics also applies to personal securities transactions of all metlife investments department access persons as defined herein who have access to material nonpublic information either by virtue of their affiliation with the metlife investments department including the registered investment adviser subsidiaries metlife investment advisors company llc mliac and metropolitan life insurance company mlic or by other means    standard of conduct capitalized terms used herein but not defined take on the meaning set forth in the glossary attached hereto as appendix a metlife seeks to foster a reputation for integrity and professionalism that reputation is a vital business asset the confidence and trust placed in us by investors and clients is something that is highly valued and must be protected as a result any activity which creates even the suspicion of misuse of material nonpublic information by investments or any access person which gives rise to or appears to give rise to any breach of fiduciary duty owed to any client which creates any actual or potential conflict of interest between any client and investments or any access persons or even the appearance of any conflict must be avoided and is prohibited court decisions and securities and exchange commission sec rulings interpreting the federal securities laws make it unlawful for any person to purchase or sell securities on the basis of material nonpublic information commonly known as insider trading the insider trading and securities fraud enforcement act of  itsfea requires all investment advisers and brokerdealers to establish maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent insider trading itsfea also provides additional penalties for individuals who engage in insider trading as well as their employers if such employers have failed to establish and enforce adequate procedures in addition the investments department prohibits certain practices even though they may not be unlawful because metlife considers them to be poor business practices or to reflect adversely on metlifes reputation    the investments department policy is     a an access person may not trade for his or her own account a personal account directly or indirectly in securities on the basis of material information which is gained in the course of employment or which is gained by any other means and which has not been made known to the general public for at least fortyeight  hours     b an access person may not trade in securities for or on behalf of an account owned managed or controlled by investments a company account on the basis of material information which is gained in the course of employment or which is gained by any other means and which has not been made known to the general public for at least fortyeight  hours     c an access person may not recommend to any person either in connection with the access persons employment or otherwise any transactions in any securities on the basis of material information whether or not gained in the course of such access persons employment with metlife or the investments department and which has not been made known to the general public for at least fortyeight  hours     d an access person may not communicate material nonpublic information to any person except in furtherance of such access persons duties as an associate of metlife the exact scope of what constitutes material nonpublic information is a continuously evolving area of law for purposes of this code of ethics material nonpublic information should be deemed to be any information about an issuer which is nonpublic because it has not been disseminated in a manner which would cause it to be available to investors generally provided there is a substantial likelihood that the information would affect the market price for the securities or any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether to buy sell or hold securities of the issuer material nonpublic information about a company or its securities is likely to originate from someone who is an insider the concept of insider is very broad the term includes certain officers directors and employees of a company a person can become a temporary insider if he or she enters into a special confidential relationship in the conduct of a companys affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the companys purposes a temporary insider can include among others a companys outside counsel outside accountants consultants bank lending officers and the employees of such organizations as well as in certain cases secretaries administrative or legal    assistants messengers and printers in addition the investments department itself may become a temporary insider of a company with which it has a business relationship or for which it performs other services in these situations the company expects the investments department and its access persons to keep nonpublic information confidential in addition a person who receives material nonpublic information from an insider a tippee may assume the status of an insider with respect to the material nonpublic information received if the tippee knows or should know that this information has been provided in violation of the insiders duty to keep it confidential any benefit derived from the misuse of material nonpublic information does not have to be monetary but can be a reputational or goodwill benefit for example an insider who provides material nonpublic information to others in order to make it appear that he or she holds an important position may violate the law in addition for example a parent who provides material nonpublic information to a son or daughter who then purchases or sells securities may violate the prohibition on tipping in addition to the general prohibitions against purchasing or selling securities while in possession of material nonpublic information and against disclosing such information to others who purchase or sell securities discussed above there is a specific sec rule concerning trading in connection with tender offers this rule makes it unlawful to buy or sell securities while in possession of material information relating to a tender offer if the person buying or selling the securities knows or has reason to know that the information is nonpublic and has been acquired directly or indirectly from the person making or planning to make the tender offer from the target company or from any officer director partner or employee or other person acting on behalf of either the bidder or the target company the term tender offer generally refers to the purchase of a significant amount of securities of a company at a price above the prevailing market price information should be presumed material if it relates to such matters as dividend increases or decreases earnings and earnings estimates changes in previously released earnings estimates significant increases or decreases in orders for a companys products dispositions of subsidiaries or divisions merger or acquisition proposals or agreements changes in debt ratings significant new products or discoveries extraordinary borrowing significant major litigation liquidity problems extraordinary management developments purchases or sales of substantial assets actions by a company that may have an impact on the companys financial condition such as significant writedowns of assets additions to reserves for bad debts or contingent liabilities recapitalizations restructurings spin offs leveraged buyouts contract awards new products voluntary calls of debt or preferred stock public offerings of debt or equity securities major price and marketing changes significant litigation impending bankruptcy and investigations by government entities material information also includes similar major events that would be viewed as having materially altered the total mix of information available regarding a company or the market for its securities    as a rule information which is no longer timely or cannot otherwise be reasonably anticipated to have any immediate market impact will lack materiality among the factors to be considered in determining whether information is actually material are the degree of its specificity the extent to which it differs from information previously disseminated publicly and its reliability in view of its nature and the source and the circumstances under which it was received nonpublic information is information that has not been publicly disclosed information received about an issuer under circumstances which indicate that it is not yet in general circulation in the market place may be deemed to be nonpublic information as a rule before determining that information is public one should be able to point out some readily demonstrable fact to show that the information has been disseminated to the public through for example bloomberg an sec filing a press conference or press release or after delivery of the information to a stock exchange the associated press the new york times the wall street journal or appropriate trade publications including online communications in certain situations the insider may be required to know that the information has been publicly disseminated one should wait for at least fortyeight  hours after the information has been disseminated to the public through such means before trading for his or her personal account or a company account    penalties for insider trading civil and criminal penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information are severe both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers and other controlling persons a person can be subject to some or all of the penalties below even if he or she does not personally benefit from the violation penalties include        civil injunctions        treble damages        disgorgement of profits        jail sentences up to  years for each violation        fines for the person who committed the violation of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided whether the person actually benefited or the benefit accrued to a tippee of that person and        fines for the employer or other controlling person ie supervisors of up to the greater of  or three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided events have shown how severe the penalties for insider trading can be and how becoming involved in insider trading can result not only in such things as fines andor the loss of a persons liberty but can also destroy careers and families and cause public humiliation and disgrace the late s cases involving ivan boesky dennis levine and the more recent cases involving martha stewart or the galleon hedge fund are good examples    in addition any violation of this code of ethics can be expected to result in sanctions by metlife including but not limited to such disciplinary action as a warning a reprimand probation suspension demotion or dismissal of the persons involved even if such violation does not also violate the law    making a determination any question as to what constitutes material nonpublic information should be resolved in the most conservative fashion ie that the determination be made that the information in question is material nonpublic information or the question should be referred to the securities investments law department andor the investments ethics and compliance officer the investments eco or hisher designee for a ruling before trading for a company account or a personal account in the securities of a company about which you may have potential inside information ask yourself the following questions is the information material is this information that an investor would consider important in making an investment decision would this information substantially affect the market price of the securities if generally disclosed and is the information nonpublic to whom has this information been provided has the information been effectively communicated to the marketplace by being published in the wall street journal the new york times or other publications of general circulation including online communications if after consideration of the foregoing you have any questions as to whether the information is material and nonpublic you should consult the securities investments law department andor the investments eco    procedures     a proper course of conduct for those who possess material nonpublic information      if you have determined that information in your possession may be material and nonpublic a you should not purchase or sell the affected securities on behalf of yourself or others including purchases or sales for any company accounts or personal accounts b you should notify the securities investments law department andor the investments eco immediately and consult with either regarding the appropriate course of action and c you should refrain from discussing such information with any other person at metlife or any of its affiliates except in connection with your duties as an associate       in addition if the material nonpublic information was obtained in the course of your association with the investments department you should     i identify the issuer or issuers of the securities about which such material nonpublic information relates and notify the investments eco that such issuer or issuers may need to be placed on the metlife restricted issuer list the restricted list see below since no one other than the investments eco maintains a complete and current restricted list it is extremely important that the investments eco be contacted in this regard     ii not communicate the material nonpublic information except to other associates or agents of metlife or its affiliates who need to know about such information in connection with work being performed on behalf of metlife when communicating material nonpublic information is necessary you should inform the recipient of the confidential nature of such information and notify the investments eco of the identity of the recipients access to material nonpublic information must be restricted for example files containing such information should be securely maintained in ones own office or placed in limited access files within the files of ones unit or department and access to computer files containing such information must be restricted or especially coded to prevent and detect any improper use of such material      as long as the information you possess remains material and nonpublic you must comply with the provisions outlined in this code of ethics thereafter i to the extent an issuers name was placed on the restricted list or the watch list see below you should notify the investments eco that removal of such issuer may be appropriate and ii you will be free to trade on and communicate the relevant information subject to any other applicable restrictions contained elsewhere in this code of ethics after being advised by the investments eco that such issuer has been removed from the restricted list or watch list those persons with access to the restricted list andor watch list will be notified of the removal of any issuers from such lists please note that it is as important for you to notify the investments eco when      an issuer should be deleted from the restricted list or watch list as it is to notify the investments eco when an issuer needs to be added to the restricted list or watch list      when obtaining information outside the course of employment  when you acquire material nonpublic information outside the course of your employment you should not disclose this information to anyone at metlife including your unit head manager or the investments eco consequently the name of the issuer will not be placed on the restricted list nevertheless you are still prohibited from buying or selling on behalf of a company account or personal account any security issued by such issuers and from making any investment recommendations to advisory clients on the basis of such material nonpublic information     b restricted issuer lists in order to comply with the federal securities laws and to detect and prevent both the misuse of material nonpublic information as well as the appearance of impropriety in connection with securities transactions the investments eco maintains two confidential restricted lists containing the names of companies about which metlife or its affiliates or any of their associates possess material nonpublic information one list contains the names of all companies about whom metlife has material nonpublic information and that issue securities that are either public about to become public or a securities the second list contains the names of companies about whom metlife has material nonpublic information and that do not have a class of publicly issued securities these restricted lists identify issuers that are subject to certain trading restrictions an issuer may be placed on the restricted list on any occasion where under the particular facts and circumstances it is deemed necessary and appropriate to restrict trading in order to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information the private company list is used to ensure that metlife does not have an informational advantage in connection with a purchase or sale of a private security in the secondary market an issuers name is deleted from the restricted list when in the judgment of the investments eco metlife or its affiliates no longer possess material nonpublic information about the issuer or its securities for the period during which an issuer is listed on the restricted list neither the investments department nor any of its access persons may buy or sell solicit trades in or recommend a security of that issuer the investments eco maintains a record of each addition to or deletion from the restricted list this record reflects the date the issuer was added to or deleted from the restricted list and the names of the persons responsible for the addition to or deletion from the restricted list and a brief summary of the reasons for the inclusion or deletion    the restricted list itself is confidential information and therefore should not be widely distributed access to the restricted list must be approved by the investments eco associates with access to the restricted list should not share it with anyone who has not been approved by the investments eco the investments eco will generally only approve access to associates who  trade in securities that are likely to be on the restricted list  monitor compliance with the restricted list and its policies and procedures or  supervise these traders and monitors the investments eco will also assess whether the associate has frequent or urgent need for access or it would be a significant inconvenience for the associate to obtain the information from other sources     c watch list the investments eco also maintains a watch list for those issuers about which metlife its affiliates or any of their associates may as a result of special relationships or otherwise appear to be in the position of having sensitive information even though no employee actually has material nonpublic information thus for example the investments eco will list the issuer on whose board a metlife executive group member sits the investments eco will also place names of issuers with whom metlife or its affiliates has contractually restricted itself from trading securities above a certain threshold for the period during which an issuer is listed on the watch list the investments department and its access persons are prohibited from buying or selling soliciting trades in or recommending a security of that issuer if an access person wishes to trade for a company account in the securities of any issuer whose name appears on the watch list such access person must first request a waiver from the investments eco the investments eco will in turn check with the executive group member to determine if that person possesses material nonpublic information with respect to the applicable security and if that person does not the investments eco may permit the access person to trade in the name for a limited period of time on a case by case basis similarly in the case of selfimposed contractual trading restrictions the investments eco will check the applicable contract to determine whether the purchase or sale desired by the access person fits within the contractual trading limitations and will advise the access person accordingly    section ii personal trading policies and procedures    introduction metlife has several levels of reporting and monitoring with respect to personal securities transactions based on the nature of an associates duties and responsibilities at metlife and its affiliates and the assessed likelihood of the associate having access to material nonpublic information in the course of hisher employment this section sets forth the personal trading policies and procedures that apply to metlife investments department access persons as defined herein together access persons access persons may be subject to other codes of ethics or personal trading policies and procedures and are
