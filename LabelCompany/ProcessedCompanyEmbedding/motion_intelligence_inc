smarter assessment solutions planning to launch in  quadrant biosciences is striving to address two of the most important and talkedabout health issues facing parents and children today with key advancements in how they are evaluated concussion and autism spectrum disorder situation concussion this year in the us alone  to  million athletes will experience a sportsrelated concussion despite increased public awareness the standard tools used to evaluate and treat a concussion — selfreported symptoms and expert opinion — offer poor reliability and sensitivity consequently many of these injuries are misdiagnosed creating a heightened risk of serious secondary injuries if the athlete prematurely returns to playunderstandably physicians are frustrated with the absence of credible tools to objectively and quantitatively assess concussion injuries and the critical returntoplay decision parents are worried about the health of their children and the unseen consequences of their injuries and athletes are concerned about the extent of their injuries and unclear about the timeline for recoveryquadrant biosciences is currently working on solutions to this problem on two fronts functional assessment and epigenetic biomarkers  solution the clearedge assessment system introducing the clearedge assessment system a new standard of care that will integrate clinical best practices into a single system with cloudbased analytics clearedge will offer clinicians a suite of testing applications that arecomprehensive — designed to incorporate the clinical assessment of patient symptoms physical performance and cognitive functionsobjective — patient test results are quantitatively analyzed relative to prior performance and peer group statistics this system uses advanced malingeringdetection and effortassessment techniques to limit possible test manipulationclinically reliable — the preliminary testretest reliability assessment indicates that the system will be appropriate for clinical decisionmakingevolutionary — academic research is translated to clinical practice the inclusion of dualtask testing and effort assessment is a first in the industrycost effective — the system’s low cost of acquisition and short testing interval approximately  minutes facilitate time and revenue efficiencies using existing cpt codesportable — the entire system fits in a briefcase clearedge testing can occur almost anywhere solution concussion biomarker in saliva there has been a big push by researchers to find a reliable biomarker test to objectively diagnose concussion but thus far it has remained elusive however  research we are conducting in cooperation with penn state college of medicine and suny upstate medical university may change that focusing on epigenetic microrna in the saliva we have identified a novel and accurate biomarker for concussion in children among the significant findings of this research includesaliva a rich source  microrna’s have been found in relative abundance in the saliva which when coupled with their unique epigenetic properties make them attractive biomarker candidatesaccurate differentiation  six micrornas had parallel changes in csf and saliva and could accurately separate concussion and control casespredictive of symptom duration  the study also showed compelling data that this biomarker may be a better predictor of symptom headache fatigue difficulty concentrating etc duration than current standard concussion assessmentsresults of this research were presented at the  pediatric academic societies meeting in san francisco in may  situation autism autism spectrum disorder asd is a medical condition that affects a person’s communication abilities and social skills and often causes repetitive patterns of behavior and a narrow range of interests the number of children diagnosed annually with asd has increased significantly between  and  from one in  to one in although there is no known cure for autism early intervention with behavioral therapies eg applied behavioral techniques has been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and the disabling aspects of the condition however early intervention requires early diagnosis and existing diagnostic tests lack the essential specificity to asd to make them a useful tool for early screening solution autism screening test in cooperation with suny upstate medical center and penn state college of medicine quadrant biosciences has developed a unique test that facilitates the early diagnosis of asd our autism screening test which involves specific biomarkers has been yielding impressive sensitivity and specificity numbers this groundbreaking technology is expected to be commercially available in  disclaimer note the products
