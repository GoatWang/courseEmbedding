out of  stars  reviews write a review  out of  stars by gjsullivan on  excellent value i got these and put them to use right away the precision and finish on these is very good there is no runout and they cut easily and cleanly making holes in the center and kn the edge of the wood the added bonus is the case that is much better than i expected it has fitted holes for each bit and it makes them easy to access unless they dont hold up over time which will take a few years to determine i cant see where these would not be good for any use you have at the current  off sale price they are an excellent value  out of  stars by mike on  does what i want still trying it out  out of  stars by jaykaypur on  a great deal i use this project in box building and small projects  out of  stars by nascardan on  great buy ease of use when boring holes in wood  out of  stars by chuck on  cant beat them for the price use mostly for woodturning bores seem to be very true even with extension  out of  stars by erose on  good value my first set of forstner bits ive only used one bit so farbased on everything i had read about it having a smooth bottom i had assumed it was entirely flat and smooth the holes that i bored had a smaller pinpoint hole in the very center which i predicted when i saw the actual bit construction not quite what i expected but thats my own fault for not researching the item more carefully the holes are very flat and smooth otherwise great price i saw similarly priced bit sets from other sources and their product reviews werent as good so i am glad i went with these and i love the case design  out of  stars by reddragon on  i like it work well for me i bought this for my compoud cutting it work for what i needed it for the bits are the sizes i neededit for would buy again  out of  stars by buck on  i like my forstner bits just fine small projects around the house  out of  stars by utahmike on  first forstner bits a screaming good deal that i could not resist nice addition to my growing list of goodies  out of  stars by josorl on  a good tools i use these bits to drill to graft branches of my bonsai  out of  stars by paul the scroller on  specifications need update i just received a set and it appears to be a real bargain especially at the sale price they are all marked as made in china but today what isnt the one problem i see at this point is the sheet of documentation that came with the bits for example it recommends drilling into soft wood with the  bit at  rpm however the bit itself is engraved with the warning not to exceed  rpm the larger bits are marked not to exceed  rpm but the recommendation is to use them at  rpm in soft wood i think i would go with the slower speeds for safety but i also think the manufacturer and the packager should get together on a consistent message  out of  stars by scott on  very nice very nice product made even better by a really great deal i have bought several and had them personalized as gifts i then bought  for myself  out of  stars by jim on  good bits great price i bought these about  months ago and hadnt had a chance to use them until the past few days i do custom woodworking and hate using spade bits on oak they tend to tear the wood more than id like i needed some forstner bits but could never find a set that was in my price range for occasional use i came across this set at a woodcraft store in pa and got them while they were on sale it was the best money i spent while i was in pa i used the   bit to bore a countersink hole in oak and it tore thruogh it like a hot knife through butter i also used the  bit to bore a hole through a  block of oak for a lamp and on a slow speed in my shopsmith drill press it went right through without smoke or burn if you need a good set of bits save your money on the expensive set and buy this one its well worth the money  out of  stars by just round the corner plumber on  good bargain i really like this product i think it will be a great help for me in realizing my projects  out of  stars by tsquare on  for the price i was amazed very nice a good inexpensive set of bits in a very nice case so far i have only had the opportunity to use the  bit but used it to drill into the end of a  diameter peg and it worked great  out of  stars by ddave on  good value purchased for half off and used the   bit to cut  holes for euro hinges in curly maple used a drill guide and an v cordless drill cut was clean no burning and i didnt have to apply too much pressure for casual use this seems like a great value  out of  stars by thumper on  a lot of value for the price above average set of forstner bits at a very good price fits well in my budget as a beginning woodworker  out of  stars by workinman on  nice set they cut great clean chips nice flat bottoms  out of  stars by bigfoot on  good value good value but the smaller bits are useless because they are dull or poorly sharpened from the factory  out of  stars by bigfoot on  good for the money the smaller sizes are not very sharp so you need to bear down too much for a hole unless you take your time you will burn the wood  out of  stars by spikespal on  seems like a fine set trying to learn about woodworking and expand my collection of tools simple test looks very satisfactory  out of  stars by patrick the woodworker on  product is everything i was expecting  i have no qualms about using this product it is durable and comes with a great storage case the price is also excellent this was a gift to my son and when it first came the wood case was cracked i notified the company and they sent a new wood case   out of  stars by txbudman on  i would recommend this product i would recommend this product  out of  stars by drjackel on  great sale price impressive  out of  stars by dave of washington on  not the best but good for the price if you plan on using these bits on a regular basis they may dissapoint you they do not bore like a high end forstner bit but used on small projects they are the best bang for the dollar you need to be cautious and do not use hard preasure as they can burn as they go in the wood  out of  stars by ron on  forstner bits i purchased them for cabinet making in my own home  out of  stars by moorewood on  nice set for the price nice set to have for occasional use  out of  stars by sigi on  cuts clean and quickly used these to install european hinges  out of  stars by woodchuck carver on  i would by this again and as a gift great for the price  out of  stars by heller on  great set of bits this bit set is great for the price i needed a  bit to drill about  stopped holes in some oak and the price of a single bit was half the price of this kit that cant be beat the bits that i have used so far have worked great and are holding there edge very well  out of  stars by fpw on  good for price the cutters are sharp and the bits are more solid than other inexpensive sets i have looked at i would recommend them to have on hand for all the odd sizes and for the one or two that get used all the time invest in a better bit works great fro me  out of  stars by omar on  nice but need mm measures would be great to have mm scale units  out of  stars by lit joe on  good set for the money a good set for the money for general use  out of  stars by quickshift on  a great product at a good price this is a nice set they cut clean smooth holes  out of  stars by gbh on  works for me need a bit better than a spade bit  out of  stars by its me on  id reccomend it to anyone the case is great even down to the lettering they engraved for me exactly what i expected   out of  stars by swat prez on  what a set what a deal great set of bits at an unbelievable price easy to sharpen holds edge very well like top of the line

impression is good havent used much but time will tell if it is durable very impressed with workmanship and presentation of case  out of  stars by thom on  good quality for hobbylevel work good price for a wide assortment and quality is very good for hobby use  out of  stars by fnox on  forstner bit set in practical case before i bought this set i used a similar quality set china in a professional woodworking shop they cut through  inches of white oak quite admirably while this set is not for the perfectionist it cuts dog holes in my carving table without mishap having a graduated set is a big plus as you never know when you have to move up to cover a goof or other error  out of  stars by rookie woodworker on  a gift i should have kept for myself i gave this forstner set as a gift to my father who is enjoying woodworking in his retirement the quality of the bits and the case were outstanding and should provide quality service for many years  out of  stars by dennis on  great value i have not actually used them yet but for the price you cant go wrong  out of  stars by bob on  good product these bits work as good as my others   out of  stars by granmat on  excellent buy i have used some pieces in little projects with positive result the special price was excellent i think that i made a nice buy  out of  stars by durocshark on  it burns id been buying forstner bits one at a time but when this set went on sale i thought id dive in two different bits in this set have been used so far and both burn the wood badly i thought that maybe it was my drill press so i chucked up a chunk of maple on the lathe and tried with the  bit going an inch deep same thing there perhaps more forgiving woods will be ok but maple and padauk get burned up pretty easily with these bits my other ones dont have this problem of course but i paid more for each of those than i paid for this whole set  out of  stars by raymond acevedo on  nice price great value  out of  stars by tom on  fatastic bits i have been looking for a cutter that could help me to cut a round hole for the connection of leg and face of chair it is great and powerful  out of  stars by scharl with the snarl on  great set for beginners this is a great and fairly inexpensive set of forstner bits great for amateur woodworkers looking for that first set of forstner bits very economically priced next to carbide tips they did their job much better than expected but my only concern will be the eventual wear over time  out of  stars by john on     out of  stars by jim on  good price  have only used a few of the bits so far work just as they should   out of  stars by tattoo ted on  an excellent product i use this product on an array of different projects they are well made and the case is great for shop or job sites  out
