pipeline respiratory depression respiratory depression opiate painkillers and respiratory depression opioid analgesic drugs are commonly used to control pain on an acute postoperative basis after major surgery or on a chronic basis in cases of cancerrelated or other chronic pain however µopioid receptor agonists such as fentanyl morphine and other opioid painkillers can cause significant depression of respiratory function due to binding at µopioid receptors on the respiratory rhythm generating neurons in the brainstem respiratory depression rd can be fatal and is a constant concern in the postoperative or general care setting after surgery or in other situations eg chronic pain where potent opioid analgesics are administered susceptibility to opioidinduced rd varies among individuals and predicting which patients are most sensitive is difficult although older age obesity diseases affecting the respiratory or cardiovascular system and sleep apnea are some of the risk factors patient controlled analgesia pca is another major area in which opioidinduced rd may be problematic many postsurgical patients are allowed to control their pain level during the first  days after surgery by self administration of painkiller through pca devices while pca is generally safe because doses are limited it can be difficult to know whether the patient is more sensitive to opioid drugs than normal in addition mistakes in programming the pca devices can be made by hospital staff  very importantly pain management goals may not be achieved due to the administration of lower doses than optimal due to concern about rd reversal agents such as naloxone are available but all known reversal agents for opioidinduced rd are opioid receptor antagonists and thus also reverse the analgesic activity leaving the rescued patient in severe pain more often if a patient is found not breathing by hospital staff ‘code blue’ the patient may be placed on a respirator which can lead to an increased hospital stay and risk of infection in some cases respiratory arrest can lead to cardiac arrest and death anesthetics and respiratory depression other central nervous system depressants such as anesthetics eg propofol and anxiolytics antianxiety drugs may remain in blood circulation after surgery and contribute to rd  propofol and other anesthetic agents may also produce rd on their own if not properly controlled and in those cases naloxone is ineffective as an rd reversal or prevention agent thus there is a significant need for an agent that could prevent or reverse rd but which would not affect propofol anesthetic activity or anxiolytic activity of benzodiazapines or other anxiolytic agents respirerx and its collaborators have determined that respirerx’s ampakines have these desired activities and may be used to prevent or rescue from opioidinduced rd without affecting opiate analgesia or prevent or rescue from propofol or anxiolytic induced rd braincontrolled breathing

is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three escalating doses of cx versus placebo when administered prior to remifentanil with respiration analgesia and a number of other clinical measures being taken after administration of both drugs  the clinical trial to be conducted at duke university was initiated in march  the commencement of this clinical trial was subject to resolution of two deficiencies since resolved raised by the fda in its clinical hold letter dated november   the fda cited a single incidence of mild necrosis in cardiac tissue from a rat in the highest dose group tested in a week toxicology study  in that study histopathology analysis was performed on the heart tissue only from rats that received placebo and the highest of three doses of cx  in its letter the fda requested that cardiac tissue from all animals in all dosage groups be analyzed  this analysis has been completed and according to two independent boardcertified pathologists there does not appear to be any drugrelated histopathology and the original finding most likely was due to “progressive rodent cardiomyopathy” a syndrome commonly observed in this strain of rats the fda requested that the company perform an additional study in which rats are to be given a single administration of three dosages of cx followed by neurohistopathology evaluation   and  days after drug administration  in two previous studies no neuropathology had been observed after  or  days of cx administration at very high doses  the agreed upon single dose study has begun and is scheduled to be completed by year end we performed the requested analysis the additional study and on january   responded to the fda and provided an amendment to the ind on february   removed the clinical hold allowing us to commence the clinical trial shortly thereafter we previously showed that a predecessor amapakine compound cx was able to prevent fentanylinduced respiratory depression without affecting the painkilling analgesic activity of the opiate while having an identical mechanism of action cx is more potent than cx and is covered by a recently allowed patent affording it much longer patent life as discussed in the respiratory disorders section respirerx believes that an agent which can prevent druginduced respiratory depression without affecting the drug’s intended use as an analgesic or anesthetic will be welcomed by practitioners who are constantly concerned about the potentially serious even lethal respiratory side effects of opioid painkillers as they try to provide as much

pharmaceuticals inc — novel medicines for respiratory diseases – dated october   overview respirerx pharmaceuticals inc otcqbrspi is developing small molecule medicines for the treatment of respiratory disease with a focus on sleep apneas and respiratory depression and distress the company believes that its translational approach will move forward fundamental scientific knowledge and apply it to human medical needs and incorporate the results into medical practice respirerx’s depth of knowledge and its data span from the molecular level to the cellular level to the organ level to the whole nonhuman animal level and now ultimately to the human level some people refer to this translational approach as taking discoveries from the bench to the bedside sleep apnea is not just snoring but rather a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person’s breathing is interrupted repeatedly throughout the night the disorder is a major cause of motor vehicle and industrial accidents and is comorbid with cardiovascular disease type  diabetes and other conditions with a large patient population with few treatment options sleep apnea represents a market potential of  billion to  billion per year for respirerx’s drug candidates sleep apnea comes in a variety of forms most commonly obstructive sleep apnea osa central sleep apnea csa and mixed sleep apnea osa is the most common form of sleep apnea the american academy of sleep medicine commissioned a study published in august  entitled “exploring the economic benefits of osa diagnosis and treatment” a few key points from that study are that there are an estimated  million americans with osa apneahypopnea index   of which  million are undiagnosed and  million are diagnosed total costs of osa in the united states are estimated at  billion the costs associated with the  million diagnosed group are estimated to total  billion which breaks down as follows i  billion for nonsurgical treatments cpap device continuous positive airway pressure lifestyle oraldental devices etc but no medicines as there are currently no pharmacotherapies for osa ii  billion for surgical treatments and iii  million for diagnosis testing and followup the costs estimated for the undiagnosed group are  billion of which  billion is related to motor vehicle accidents  billion to workplace accidents and  billion to lost productivity part of the problem with osa is that diagnosis is inconvenient and the treatment options are not particularly patient friendly or effective cpap is very effective but very patient unfriendly and compliance is very low in addition much of the population does not understand the symptoms respirerx believes that if a drug treatment were approved for osa not only would a significant number of nonsurgically treated patients switch to the drug regimen but a percentage of the currently undiagnosed population would get tested in addition there are companies pursuing less onerous diagnostic methods including even home based tests that could increase the number of sufferers diagnosed the cause of csa is very different from osa even though both result in the cessation of breathing for multiple short periods of time during sleep because the cause is different the drug therapy would need to be different respirerx is developing different drugs for each form of sleep apnea respirerx has two phase  clinical study medicines targeting obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea phase b clinical data for dronabinol for osa is expected to be announced before the end of  and a phase a clinical study of cx is planned for csa in chronic opioid users see below in a previous phase a study of the three types of sleep apnea described above cx showed signals of efficacy in csa and mixed but not osa by the end of  the company is planning to release data from its phase a clinical study of cx conducted at the duke university school of medicine for another indication opioid induced respiratory depression rd discussed in more detail below pending additional funding respirerx is also looking to grow its portfolio of medicines to include product candidates for the treatment of respiratory distress in patients suffering from respiratory distress associated with spinal cord injury pompe disease an orphan disease and a niche market and other indications in september  respirerx took the first step toward a nasdaq or other national exchange uplisting by completing a reverse stock split investment highlights two proprietary small molecule platforms—cannabinoids and ampakines three phase  or phase ready development programs several preclinical programs focus on large markets with unmet clinical needs more than  patents and patent applications multiple opportunities for strategic collaborations nondilutive financing from national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and national institute on drug abuse nida – more than  million to date experienced and accomplished management team positive phase a efficacy results in rd osa and csa commercial and intellectual property ip protection for compounds and uses product pipeline “respirerx is on to something unique it is the only company focused on physiologically based sleep breathing disorders and respiratory depression and distress and has a suite of ipprotected advanced clinicalstage medicines that have the potential to address these conditions” stated dr james manuso president and ceo of respirerx amapakines cx and cx cx dr robert m califf in the february   edition of the fda voice stated “…as all of you know more americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes opioids were involved in  deaths in  according to the cdc” those deaths occur primarily from respiratory depression caused by opioids and we are not speaking only about illegal street use we are talking about people overdosing on prescribed opioids who are taking them legally chronic pain patients who are regular opioid users develop tolerance to the drugs for pain and need higher doses to achieve pain control think prince but now run the risk of respiratory depression and the elderly can forget how much of their medications they have taken and the list goes on pain management in a postsurgical setting is limited by the dose of opioids that can be given due to the risk of causing respiratory depression so there are acute semiacute and chronic applications for a drug like cx to either reverse or prevent respiratory depression caused by opioids a phase a study of cx was conducted at duke university school of medicine and was designed to determine the ability of cx to reduce the respiratory depression caused by remifentanil a potent opioid and consisted of two stages the first stage was a doubleblind placebo controlled crossover comparison of  mg of cx and placebo and the second was an openlabel dose ascending analysis of  mg and  mg of cx subjects were tested once a week for four weeks during each of these weekly sessions subjects were challenged with remifentanil in two ways as a single acute bolus injection remi  and as an infusion remi  these procedures were designed respectively as models of acute opioid overdose and chronic opioid consumption in which opioid blood levels remain relatively constant data analysis is in process and the company is planning to release data from this phase a clinical study of cx by the end of  in prior studies with another of respirerx’s ampakines cx the company’s experimental medicine prevented respiratory depression caused by alfentanyl another potent opioid without offsetting the desirable painkilling effects of the analgesic drug based upon these results and subject to available financing the company is currently planning to conduct a study of cx in csa patients who are chronic opioid users chronic opioid users’ respiratory depression is csa measured during sleep approximately  of chronic opioid users have csa and it is the primary risk factor for mortality one of respirerx’s compounds cx that is a candidate for further development in spinal cord injury patients suffering from respiratory distress of the approximately  spinal cord injury patients in the united states approximately half of the injuries occur in the cervical neck region  of those require respiratory support usually a ventilator and  require continued ventilator support after discharge animal studies support the notion that cx can improve respiration in spinal cord injury patients suffering from respiratory distress ampakines have also shown efficacy in animal models of pompe disease an orphan disease where patients may experience respiratory difficulties and also respiratory distress in premature births finally respirerx intends to develop a combination formulation of an ampakine most likely cx with an opioid the intent would be to create a “safer” opioid as a person took more and more pills in an attempt to achieve pain control they would receive more and more of respirerx’s ampakine which in turn would prevent respiratory depression dronabinol breakthrough therapy for obstructive sleep apnea dronabinol respirerx’s product candidate for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea is the first medicine being develop to treat the physiological causes of the disorder the standard treatment is the continuous positive airway pressure cpap device which for reasons made obvious by the photo below has an extremely high noncompliance rate not surprisingly  percent of diagnosed patients never initiate cpap treatment when prescribed a machine and over  percent of patients stop using cpap in the first year dronabinol delta tetrahydrocannabinol is approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of anorexia associated with aids and for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and has a long history of safety respirerx expects much greater patient compliance with this form of treatment over the cpap device phase a clinical trials for dronabinol successfully demonstrated a clear signal of activity in osa patients financed by a nondilutive  million grant from the national institutes of health nih a phase b trial for the drug was conducted in  at four major centers by the university of illinois the phase b trial was completed in august  upcoming catalyst phase b data analysis is now underway and results are expected for release by the end of  respirerx plans to meet with the fda to determine the path to registration respirerx has obtained the licensed rights expires  from the university of illinois to the use patents for the use of dronabinol actually any cannabinoid of which dronabinol is one for the treatment of any sleep related breathing disorder of which osa is one further patents are pending on modified release formulations for dronabinol as a schedule iii medicine use is highly monitored by the us government and is not covered by insurers for use outside of the existing fda approved label which discourages off label prescriptions of the generic versions of dronabinol this provides market exclusivity via monitoring as well as via pricing as third party reimbursement would only be available for a respirerx brand of dronabinol as respirerx would be the only company with the fda label for osa development milestones management james s manuso phd mba — ceo president and vicechairman of the board of directors dr james manuso is a biotechnologypharmaceutical industry
