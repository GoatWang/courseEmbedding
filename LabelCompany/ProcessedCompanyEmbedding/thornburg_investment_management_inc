thornburg investment management thornburg is an independent global investment management firm that provides a range of active investment strategies to serve a broad spectrum of client needs headquartered in santa fe new mexico thornburg is geographically removed from the world’s major financial centers being far from the status quo investment arena inspires us to think outside of popular opinion and base our decisions on unconventional wisdom and a larger frame of reference many investment managers may do what we do setting us apart from them however is how we do it how we think how we invest and how we’re structured our flexible perspective we bring a more flexible perspective than that of other investment firms we view a wider range of opportunities and look beyond conventional boundaries to find hidden value constant collaboration we collectively hone ideas via borderless crosspollination across our investment team for better judgement and competitive results     by conviction not convention we invest differently we take a disciplined approach to portfolio construction guided more by convictions than convention rather than using benchmarks as our starting point we apply active management to seek the best value for our clients thorough analysis and our relativevalue framework lead to conviction in our securities selection which may result in a focused portfolio     our team approach thornburg’s collaborative relativevalue research structure is such that we consider all members of the investment team to be resources for all of the firm’s strategies all analysts may make contributions to multiple strategies portfolio managers also serve as research analysts this allows them to integrate with rather than be separated from the discovery of investment ideas far from the herd our headquarters are located in the hills of santa fe new mexico this allows for distractionfree idea generation away from the more conventional wisdom of large or urbancentered investment houses access and transparency putting our clients first is also a key principle proud of our investment strategies and thoughtful of our practices we consider transparency and openness imperative to building our investors’ trust and confidence in us always independent from the beginning we have thrived through private ownership and we are firmly committed to this structure our independence removes the distractions of a corporate parent and lets us focus on what we’re supposed to do generate attractive investment returns over time   we seek to add value with
