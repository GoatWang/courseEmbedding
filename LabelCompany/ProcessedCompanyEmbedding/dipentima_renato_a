renato renny dipentima has won most of the awards the federal it marketplace offers  including five federal  awards fcws eagle award in 0 actiacs janice mendenhall spirit of leadership award and two presidential rank awards but this years presidents award recognizes another accomplishment that is arguably even more significant his careerlong commitment to mentoring young and midcareer government executives and those who are transitioning to industry dipentima spent his entire government career of more than  years at the social security administration where he rose from a gs claims examiner to become the deputy commissioner for systems and the agencys first cio he managed the transition from a paperbased approach to handling claims to an online system that processes millions of transactions each day along the way he learned some important lessons about managing expectations in congress and getting buyin from his ssa team the 1 federal  government eagle winner mary davie industry eagle winner dan chenok all fed  winner profiles the lessons of inclusion and buyin that shaped the revamping of ssa systems also governed dipentimas time at sra international now part of csra like most companies in the systems integrator community sra hired smart executives from government  but rarely for a specific job instead new recruits spent time in the finance department to learn how the company made its money and then not unlike a medical internship rotated to other departments to learn about the different parts of the companys business at that point each executive would devise a role in which he or she could create new value for the company during his  years at sra dipentima mentored a wave of executives who still play an important role in the community today and he continues to serve as counselor through his involvement with multiple companies boards mary ellen condon who joined sra from the justice department in  said dipentima was special because he listened he didnt think he had all the answers she said he let people play to their own strengths she wanted to create a security practice but at the time dipentima said there was no future in security  a declaration about which all involved still chuckle he did change his mind however and condon built a security practice ed meagher another government recruit said renny has such a deft touch to mentoring he has given an untold number of transitioning executives a safe harbor to ask the dumb questions and to explore the available possibilities his advice comes in the form of subtle questions gentle suggestions and constant encouragement i owe renny more than i can ever repay so i just try to emulate him and pay it forward kay kapoor president of att global business public sector solutions never worked for dipentima but took a class he taught at the university of maryland baltimore county renny has always been generous with his wisdom insights and ideas  not only to me but to so many people

administration and its deputy commissioner for systems renato a dipentima file photo age  education ba psychology new york university ma public policy george washington university phd public policy with concentration in technology university of maryland personal lives in annapolis with wife pat daughters margaret and katherine are both lawyers in washington how did you get to where you are the things that prepared me for what i do today began with the social security administration i held many jobs there and from about my third year on my jobs were in supervision then management and then executive positions i got wonderful experiences and training there while at social security i earned my masters and phd from the combination of working at a great agency    and the opportunities they gave i was able to develop a series of executive skills that have served me well ever since upon retiring from social security i was fortunate to have an number of opportunities in private industry and at that time i chose to join sra international people always kid me that im one of the few cios that have ever progressed to ceo sra  very much like social security  gave me a number of opportunities to demonstrate my skills and were willing to move me along through a number of executive positions until the board appointed me as ceo i think what sra saw in me was that i had a pretty deep knowledge of the federal government and how it works sras focus is always on satisfying the customer and delivering highquality products to the customer and the company felt that because of my government experience i could identify with the best ways of adding value for our customers and thats a key point that and taking care of our people are the two main things that drive our company what motivates me is having to address difficult problems i think thats why throughout my career ive been attracted to the federal government i like problems that are mission critical that challenge me intellectually and that allow me to work in a team environment im just not a loner who would get a lot of enjoyment being off on a single task by myself i think i derive the most pleasure out of my job in working in a strong team environment that was one of the things that attracted me to sra i saw very good people and a commitment to people and to the customers also what attracted me was the companys commitment to an ethic of honesty and service in my social security career the biggest challenge  but also the most rewarding challenge  was helping the agency move from being a paperbased operation to being a highly computerized operation and even now its considered one of the best agencies in the government that whole process was one of the most enriching experiences of my career and going from a privately owned company to becoming a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange and growing a company  in both revenue and numbers of employees  has been both a challenge as well as a wonderful experience in many ways i feel that ive always worked on government issues and challenges  for  years as a government employee and now for  years as an industry executive there has to be a basic underpinning to everything you do and that underpinning for me is based on a culture of honesty taking care of your customers giving them a highquality product and taking care of your

to his new job as president of federal systems for sra international inc of arlington va everyone knows that chief information officers in the federal government must do more with less and show that resources allocated for information technology is money wellspent but dipentima experienced those pressures firsthand spending more than  years inside the social security administration his last stint before joining sra in  was as deputy commissioner for systems the agencys top it position while there he also served as chairman of the it acquisition improvement team for president clintons national performance review initiative among the teams recommendations was the creation of the cio position at all agencies i dont think that gives me any special entrée or relationships he said in an interview june  but it does give him a keen understanding of the myriad challenges facing the civil and defense agencies that knowledge should boost dipentimas efforts to make agency officials think of sra when it comes to business process reengineering  a hallmark of the systems integrator processes are especially important in the current budget environment said dipentima former chief information officer at sra agencies need to look closely at how they plan projects manage them and conduct risk assessments we have always been steeped in those types of things he said dipentima also wants to keep the privately held sra on the track it has followed for  years  a historical growth rate of  percent annually and a reputation for highquality systems integration work sra had revenues of about 1 million in its last fiscal year an increase of 1 percent from the previous year the companys  fiscal year ends june  for  dipentima expects revenues to be more than 0 million the federal government accounts for about  percent of sra revenues twothirds of that business is with defense and intelligence agencies while the companys core business has been with the department of defense and intelligence agencies sra has pursued and won several indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity contracts with civilian agencies in the last two years wins such as the national institutes of healths chief information officers solutions and partners contract will help sra expand its civilian business dipentima said the governments downsizing is creating additional opportunities for sra this is real downsizing dipentima said of the governments plan to reduce its work force by 00 people over five years whats more the demand for government services continues to grow dipentima said the only way to do that is to automate and make the people who are still there more productive he said but agencies cannot simply throw it dollars at their problems in the current budget environment he said as a result agencies are wrestling with questions about what kind of investments they should make what kind of projects to pursue and how to choose among the wide variety of options available he said cios have to focus on strategic planning business process reengineering investment analysis and capital planning and performance measures dipentima said to do this the agencies have to look at how they do their jobs an area in which sra is particularly strong he said they are a market leader in business process reengineering said william loomis an analyst with ferris baker watts a baltimore market research firm the market for these types of services is growing because agencies must be able to justify how their it spending addresses their needs you have to be able to show your underlying business processes arent flawed loomis said sra is a superb highend it company said tom hewitt chief executive of the market research firm federal sources inc of mclean va youll have a hard time finding flaws in that company while the pressure is on the agencies to make wise of their it dollars and find new ways of doing their jobs there also is pressure on firms like sra to deliver the services and products the agencies need dipentima said one way sra is doing this is through its rapid enterprise solutions service a process for expedited development of applications and systems he said government it managers cant wait three or four years for some big bang to occur and all of a sudden they get a system he said agencies need tangible results more quickly we will take big projects that might be four years in the making and break them into six to ninemonth increments he said each increment builds on the preceding one and it managers have real results to show for the money they are spending dipentimas promotion is a wise move hewitt said many of the procurement reforms aimed at getting the federal market to adapt more commercial practices were ideas dipentima was promoting five years ago he is a real visionary hewitt said at the time however the ideas were considered radical he put his job on the line for what he thought was right hewitt said with the government becoming smaller in size it and automation have enormous roles to play and that means that the it folks have to be nimble and have to have the authority to move quickly dipentima said it is important for cios to show they are successful he said that is where we come in someone puts their faith and funds in us so it is important that we deliver printable format email this page reader comments
