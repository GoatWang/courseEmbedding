whose skills matches your needs that means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start lookinghere are some common needs from financial advisors cash flow management budgeting retirement planning investing paying for childrens education no financial advisor is perfect for every need which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyonehow to find a

youquestions to ask a financial advisoronce you have found a few advisors you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisorhow many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust them would you trust them with your daughters education fund your retirementif you have been able to limit your list down to your final few it is time to trust your gut it is important to have an advisor you like trust and enjoy interacting with your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you dont trust pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey

a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line  picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information about financial advisors can be tough that is why smartasset created a financial advisor match tool answering basic

advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust them would you trust them with your daughters education fund your retirementif you have been able to limit your list down to your final few it is time to trust your gut it is important to have an advisor you like trust and enjoy interacting with your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you dont trust pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey

a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line  picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information about financial advisors can be tough that is why smartasset created a financial advisor match tool answering basic
