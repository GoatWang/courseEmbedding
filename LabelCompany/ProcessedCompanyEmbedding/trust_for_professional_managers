metamorphosis � we use this particular title in reference to the great changes that have characterized the past year and to the classic exposition of ancient mythology attributed to ovid kafka�s similarly named work might provide a reasonably apt metaphor but we will leave this to the reader�s imagination the mythological reference seemed appropriate as bear markets have a tendency to reveal the fanciful nature of widely accepted beliefs that underpinned the preceding bull market this most recent sequence is no exception � the circumstances leading to the events of  are by now quite familiar to most investors the federal reserve board began the sequence with overly tight monetary conditions just at the time that the technology and growth stock mania of the late th century was exhausting itself the subsequent downturn surprised policy makers who responded with a  degree shift in policy to a point of extreme and inappropriate ease � short term interest rates of around  underpinned an extraordinarily steep yield curve allowing leveraged speculation to emerge as the new national pastime the objects of that leverage were many and far flung with the main ones being real estate and genetically altered securities of all sorts these asset categories lent themselves to the easiest quickest and most extensive application of leverage after about three years of hypertrophic demand supply responses across nearly every asset type from luxury hotels and golf communities to modern art and credit derivatives were sufficient to slow and then reverse prices thus began the journey down asset deflation lane now entering year three � the sheer intensity of turbulence in the capital markets and parts of the real economy makes it difficult to keep events within any sort of stable perspective without that ability it is nearly impossible to avoid responding to every new data surprise and market shock these short term responses are a recipe for disastrous investment results � if we step back from the immediate news flow it is possible to characterize the events of the past few years in a more general and less volatile context in many ways the disturbances in the global economy over the past five years are similar in form to what occurred in the early to mid s at that time the economy particularly in the us operated under the implicit assumption that cheap abundant oil was a permanent input feature the first oil shock in  undermined every enterprise that had been built around the cheap oil hypothesis and set off a long period of substandard global growth it might be argued that the secular decline of us manufacturing especially the automobile industry was set in motion after one of their core strategic assumptions perpetually cheap energy was proven wrong thirty five years later they continue to drag an outdated business model right to the verge of bankruptcy court � the core input assumption that has been undermined in this cycle is not unlimited access to inexpensive energy but abundant and under priced credit the plethora of liquid savings particularly in asia combined with the fed�s extreme suppression of short term interest rates in the early years of this decade created compelling incentives to structure business models that would take advantage of access to leverage on extraordinarily favorable terms the entire financial infrastructure that is now unraveling had at the core of its assumptions an implicit dependence in unlimited access to cheap credit the level of belief became so outrageous as to provoke seeming serious public discussions about a leveraged buyout of general electric this would have involved hundreds of billions of borrowed dollars concentrated in one deal and yet few commentators were willing to dismiss the ideal out of hand the old saying that there is not a bell that rings at market tops is true there is not a bell there are hundreds �  table of contents we are in the process of passing from an environment of bargain priced credit to one in which lenders are going to be adequately compensated for the apparent risks that they are willing to assume the fact that few are currently willing to assume any risk is another aspect of the story returns that have been produced at the expense of overly credulous and under compensated lenders will no longer be available wall street will undergo changes more dramatic than those that occurred after fixed commissions were abolished credit dependency has become a structural weakness that will hinder the results of many large financial institutions for years to come � the mythology � every great excess has been built around a mythological core that seems to justify extraordinary valuations and behaviors a good deal of it originates and is propagated within academic circles where a veneer of intellectual respectability is applied this past cycle has been no different � chief among the deceptions was the designation of statistical variability of returns as an adequate measure of investment risk we and others have written for years about the inherent flaws of this approach which fails to take into account the unique circumstances attending every new cycle of excess histories of price fluctuations credit performance and market correlations provide insight into the past but are of little use in understanding the present and even less so as concerns the future � complex statistical analysis has arisen as a popular tool as a consequence of the widespread availability of computing power and ever more detailed records of market minutia none of what passes for risk management now would have been possible in the days of paper tickers or blackboard quotations and yet good investors were perfectly capable of limiting their exposures to potentially disastrous outcomes even in those primitive days � the confusion of volatility with risk of loss gave rise to an extensive array of new marketing and investment approaches that have characterized this cycle and its demise managers found that by presenting the illusion of higher returns without higher risk they were able to attract untold sums in short order the return sans risk illusion was accomplished in one basic fashion in essence it involved the creation of an insurance like return stream where small flows of premium were constantly received against the small probability of an insurable event the financial equivalent of a hurricane or earthquake that would warrant the payout of a large part of the accumulated premiums real insurance companies do this all the time as a legitimate and important business the problems with the modern investment version were twofold the practitioners never suggested the possibility of the unusual but highly expensive event of loss nor did they reserve against it all of the premiums they received were booked as profit � most �stable return� or �low volatility� investment strategies while not explicitly run on the insurance company model shared the same essential risk and return characteristics the most straightforward comparison exists with option writing strategies which involve the receipt of premium against the chance of an unusual market displacement that would require a large payout on the part of the option writer the key to the marketing appeal of such strategies lies in the fact that if the insurable event is rare enough a hundred year flood it will appear to uninformed investors that the strategy offers nothing but steady excess return because all propositions that promise to pay against the occurrence of an unusual event are by definition usually receiving a stream of premium payment it is very easy to show large interval of time often many years during which a pure statistical analysis based on historical data will show no risk of loss this in essence was the marketing mechanism behind a great proportion of the strategies that rose to prominence during the first two thirds of this decade  was the insurable event that was never supposed to occur in fact the financial markets� volatility during october was according to statistical analyses of historical precedent so improbable that the known �  table of contents universe has not been in existence long enough for there to be a meaningful chance of occurrence so much for modern risk management � the direct sale of option premium is the simplest investment analog to the payoff structure of an insurance business but there are many other important strategies that share similar return and risk characteristics the general principal behind each of these is the acceptance of a steady incremental return premium against the presumably small chance of some disruptive event over the past several years much of the incremental growth of the hedge fund business was based on the illusion of excess return without additional risk that can be created by these types of strategies � insurance like structures with the potential to create nearly unlimited loss in the event of unusual market displacements were spread around the globe like a mutant influenza virus structured products with these characteristics were sold as currency hedges to foreign corporations interest rate hedges to municipalities fixed income and equity substitutes to clients of private banks and commodity hedges to producers consumers and speculators in each case history provided a comforting picture of stability and normalcy � the financial market effects were equally illusory the widespread sales of credit insurance cds and other insurance like products drove down premiums across all markets currency interest rate credit and equity volatility reached historic lows during  the compression of spreads and volatility was taken as a sign that risks across all financial markets were actually diminishing as risk management techniques became ever more sophisticated the fed joined the intellectual bandwagon with carefully telegraphed perfectly regular policy moves in the mistaken belief that markets would become more predictable if monetary policy appeared to be � the entire enterprise ignored the primary rule of risk management ie the more people engaged in an investment activity the more likely that a small disturbance in results will be amplified by a coordinated rush for the exits in other words popularity is the precursor of calamity � another broad array of myths arose around the principle of diversification this valuable portfolio concept became confused with and eventually defined by various measures of statistical correlation this simply proved to be another of the fallacies underlying modern quantitative financial techniques where series of numbers are manipulated toward conclusions without a basic understanding of the processes that have generated them finance is not physics assets and strategies that were assumed to be unrelated because they had been in past cycles now proved highly correlated as a result of common ownership financing sources or inclusion in broad indices or widely held portfolio structures these new sources of correlation did not generally exist in prior cycles and hence the statistical evidence of history pointed toward none of the recent dangers the efficient frontier proved to be a long deep precipice � underlying the entire investment pantheon was an enormous global financing mechanism that presumed normalcy across all asset categories at all times almost no margin for error was allowed the combination of widespread portfolio structures that were meant to take advantage of low volatility and normal relationships within and across all markets combined with the widespread use of leverage rates well in excess of  provided a perfect mix for the transmission of acute distress across the entire landscape of global finance in essence the fourth quarter of  provided a textbook example of an old fashioned panic and crash the unique aspect of this one was the speed of propagation across nearly every asset class and every corner of the global financial system � the scope of the dislocations unfolding in the past year is such that it almost demands some broad abstract characterization in order to begin any analysis or possible response this is what seemed most lacking in governmental efforts to cushion the effects initial responses were episodic and without �  table of contents any thematic cohesion or understanding of the fundamental as opposed to local causes this lack of broad perspective also accounts for the dismal investment performance of many renowned value managers because their skills generally consisted in a thorough understanding of the values inherent in the assets and operations of individual companies the abrupt change in macroeconomic conditions which altered the metrics of all security valuations was overlooked or dismissed because most value approaches assume a gradual reversion to normalcy dramatic shifts in the nature of normalcy have the ability to invalidate historic standards of value bottom up expertise is fine unless the top down forces are overwhelming � in the aftermath of lehman�s failure world markets underwent a colossal synchronous margin call a good amount of the call was unmet by additional provision of capital and so there were widespread sellouts into markets that had ceased to function with any semblance of normal liquidity the price declines were breathtaking there was little performance differentiation among large cap equities corporate bonds commodities emerging market securities credit default swaps or other overthecounter otc derivative markets where markets completely froze the rush for liquidity simply intensified in those that were still functioning � at the heart of the issue was the matter of funding financial assets that were carried on credit were forced onto markets when the funding was withdrawn this created a spiral of lower valuations diminished bank capital and further contraction of credit in some ways this was a financial analogue to the inventory cycles that shaped the economy in the past in those cases producers would accumulate large stocks of raw materials or intermediate goods when it appeared that good times would go on forever the federal reserve would tighten credit and most of the funding for inventories which were largely carried with short term bank loans would evaporate companies would be forced to liquidate into the void of a credit starved marketplace prices would collapse and real commercial distress would ensue � in the current cycle inventory excesses and inflation were generally concentrated in financial assets and property banks balance sheets exploded with excessive securities� financing rather than commercial and industrial lending the fed�s own balance sheet which represents the primary source of funding for the financial system failed to keep pace market participants were forced to rely on private short term financing for a record stock of exotic illiquid and recently conceived securities as the adjacent chart shows the fed�s provision of liquidity through its balance sheet activities showed no meaningful expansion until crisis had reached full force even after the bear stearns failure the expansion of fed lending in response to that crisis was rapidly allowed to dissipate leading to the reemergence of the same acute funding issues in the weeks before the lehman debacle �  table of contents us factors supplying reserve funds

the bottom chart represents the ratio of the federal reserve bank balance sheet to commercial bank assets x for example a reading of  means that the frb balance sheet is  of the size of the commercial banking sector�s balance sheet � following the october crash the fed threw caution to the wind as far as its own balance sheet was concerned the historic expansion of their funding activities is well documented and from our perspective crucial in setting the stage for more normal markets � both the fed and the us treasury were slow to recognize the essential nature of this particular crisis in fact the latter may still be at a loss if their continuing erratic and piecemeal approaches are any indication the practical failure of the first troubled asset relief program tarp initiative could have been avoided if emphasis was placed on stopping the spiral of forced liquidation rather than removing certain �bad� assets from the banking system simply by funding those assets within the institutions where they resided would have preempted any need to continue selling into nonexistent markets by providing term funding within any institution that requested it the entire issue of valuation and moral hazard could have been avoided the troubled institutions would not have been rid of their mistakes but would have had the leeway to hold them apart for some number of years and absorb the losses in an orderly fashion this would have prevented the wholesale dumping of good assets and the consequent impairment of institutions that had not been playing in traffic the collapse in high grade corporate bond prices since reversed that briefly threatened the solvency of the entire insurance industry might have been avoided � the ongoing conceptual failures at treasury have not extended to the federal reserve their willingness to provide funding support across a wide expanse of capital markets has reversed many of the pressures in the more fundamental elements of credit recall that it has been less than three months since a wholesale run on money market funds seemed to be unfolding with the attendant failure of the commercial paper market since the fed began its funding efforts in earnest high grade commercial paper cp which they have purchased directly has fallen to historic low yields while �  table of contents second tier paper which continued under pressure throughout  has lately seen yields cut nearly in half � other signs of restoration within the credit and money markets abound libor london interbank offered rate and swap spreads have retreated to near normal levels nominal short term rates of all sorts are at or near historic lows high grade corporate bonds have rallied strongly and issuance among investment grade companies is beginning to run at a record pace credit while being rationed by a crippled banking system is available through the capital markets for high quality borrowers borrowing for speculative investment activities including leveraged buy outs lbos activist hedge fund forays and credit dependent relative value or arbitrage strategies is nearly impossible similar distinctions exist in mortgage markets � large high valuation commercial projects cannot be financed or refinanced under acceptable terms the equity value in most large commercial property ventures that have financing based upon either a rise in rental rates or an appreciation of the property has probably vanished jumbo mortgages are difficult to obtain for all but the most creditworthy and even they are paying well above conforming levels the direct support of the conforming mortgage markets by the fed is bringing nominal rates down to levels where large increases in refinancing activity have begun rates are now at levels where we expect to see a significant pick up in housing activity within the conforming price limits at or near current price levels prices and activity at the luxury end have much farther to fall �  � the turmoil in capital markets that characterized  is rapidly emerging in the global economy there the economic mythology that suggested the invulnerability of developing market economies to financial and asset price disruptions in the us europe and japan has suffered the intrusion of reality global demand trade and investment have collapsed commodity prices have followed thus undermining the main economic drivers of emerging market economies adding fuel to the fire is a gradual realization that many of the speculative underpinnings of credit mania in developed world financial and property markets were transmitted and perfectly replicated in developing markets a good deal of their apparent prosperity seems to have derived from hedge funds proprietary trading currency speculation and luxury property development some of these activities were legitimate adjunct to local development but many are turning out to be no more than secondary extensions of the excesses in the developed nations they have proven about as uncorrelated as nasdaq and nyse stocks � the founts of speculative wealth that shaped the last cycle and much of contemporary culture have run dry all followed the general form of utilizing unlimited cheap credit to create and amplify investment returns the business models behind the large integrated investment and commercial banks have failed like the railroads of the late th century or the automobile manufacturers that proliferated during the s most of these institutions will cease to exist in anything near their present forms and will spend years in the repair shed the same fate awaits much of the �alternative� investment universe where thousands of private management firms will disappear � in the wake of these changes at the core of our financial system there will be a long period in which the relative fortunes of various business and professional sectors will realign the oft heard complaint about �income inequality� will gradually lose its rhetorical cache as it becomes clear in hindsight that the late lamented inflation of capital assets was the primary driver of the disparities owners of capital assets and those who move them around and finance their movement naturally benefit disproportionately during a cycle in which real prices of those assets are dramatically inflated now that that cycle has ended and reversed its negative effects will fall more heavily on owners of capital assets also known as rich people the wealth envy that has driven a good deal of harmful political and legislative initiative should begin to lose some potency at least one can hope �  table of contents we have witnessed a deflationary cataclysm within the global balance sheet because all of our economic measurement systems concentrate on analysis of national income statements gdpgross domestic product changes in the valuation of existing wealth are largely overlooked this has confounded policy makers who do not seem to have a page in their operations manual that deals with generalized price changes across the balance sheet that are not clearly manifest in consumer price index cpi reports the oft heard protests of central bankers that they are not in business to address what they term �asset bubbles� seems a basic evasion of their role in regulating the extent of credit expansions regardless of the consequences of those expansions credit excess drives all generalized price expansions whether the object of the excess is consumer goods or capital assets if a central bank is unwilling to address a situation where credit grows at a far greater rate than the expansion of real output it hardly has any excuse to exist � with the collapse of asset prices across a wide section of the economy we have gone from a funding crisis to one that involves longer term financing and solvency the fed�s actions to expand their balance sheet and provide funding support for a large segment of the money and credit markets has reduced the threat of another acute phase of forced liquidation the tension in the system is no longer concentrated in the interplay between security owners and their margin clerks but between commercial debtors and creditors we have entered the workout phase of a gigantic chapter  filing during which those who owe and those who are owed will have to sit down and work out some settlement that takes into account the new lower levels of value that have arisen in a world where financing can no longer assume asset appreciation in some instances eg the automobile industry the process will be public political and highly complex in others it will be as simple as a commercial mortgage holder taking possession of a property and accepting the operating cash flows in lieu of the previous owner�s mortgage payments in almost every instance there will be some loss of nominal value for all parties concerned � it is in this process that adherence to free market principles by the incoming administration will be crucial the genius of free markets lies in their freedom to adjust to change in a way that continually clears the slate of harmful rigidities when demand for a good or service diminishes the price will fall until demand is restored markets that are burdened with oversupply will fall to a clearing level at which the excess is taken up and normal production can resume when businesses become less profitable compensation of employees with those businesses must fall to levels that allow the restoration of profitability absent that the businesses will fail all aspects of a free market system must be sufficiently elastic so that the inevitable fluctuations can be smoothly adjusted to the ability of prices to adjust easily is the central requisite for a properly functioning market economy the difficult fact for many people with a more interventionist bent to accept is that there is no such thing as a �proper� price level that can be divined by some group of assiduous politicians or their well credentialed retainers the markets let you know when a price has reached a level at which some restorative or restrictive response is forthcoming prices can only be characterized by the human responses that they provoke two dollars per gallon was always believed to be a high price for gasoline but in the recent cycle it didn�t seem to stop people from purchasing gigantic powerful vehicles or driving them as far as always four dollars proved the real breaking point but that was only apparent after the market took prices there � with the perilous state of finance and global confidence any policies that inhibit the process of adjustment within capital markets and the real economy will be detrimental to prospects for recovery to the extent that these policies tend toward those espoused by the left wing of the democratic party there is the potential for a longer more serious period of depressed activity we would be particularly alarmed by any moves to raise taxes limit or alter the terms of international trade or compel unionization among more private sector workers �  table of contents to the extent that markets are allowed to adjust to the new environment recovery in the us housing sector should begin during the next two quarters as both prices and mortgage rates reach levels that provoke more normal demand and construction stabilization in housing activity not a resumption of price appreciation will be a precursor of a more general restoration of demand and should provide some valuation metrics and liquidity within mortgage derivative markets as with other areas of the economy it is important that government allows house values to find levels at which there is a natural demand efforts to artificially maintain previously inflated prices will only postpone real recovery � any stabilization and recovery in the real economy depends upon the restoration of normalcy in credit and money markets the long term impairment of the banking system precludes a major role for bank lending as a counterweight to the economic malaise capital markets will be called upon as a primary source of financing in this context the restorative trends underway within these markets are heartening it was not long ago that the morning financial news was headed by the latest libor fix at this writing three month dollar libor has fallen from its october high of  to an historic low of  similar declines in rates for prime and second grade commercial paper are evident mortgage spreads have contracted and investment grade bond yields are well below their average long term yields having come down substantially since october issuance of investment grade debt is accelerating to record levels in the us and europe � three years ago we explained our concerns about property and mortgage markets by noting that in a heavily indebted economy seemingly benign changes in interest rates will have disproportionately severe effects on overall activity at the time people argued that interest rates despite having risen substantially from their  lows were still well within normal ranges the idea that a  federal funds rate could precipitate a secular collapse of residential real estate was regarded as absurd we are currently holding out a similar but functionally obverse proposition namely that the very degree of indebtedness within our economy makes it extremely responsive to the palliative effects of lower interest rates as credit markets continue to heal the benefits of lower rates will be transmitted through an expanding section of borrowers already the automatic resets of corporate loans in relation to libor is reducing rates for a large number of borrowers as is the boom in mortgage refinancing with  year rates below  as the effects of the fed�s actions continue to expand from their initial orbit increasing rewards for some greater degree of risk assumption should be at hand � past performance is not a guarantee of future

which in turn has a direct impact on each employee’s individual bottom line simply put our success is tied to the success of our clients ok i’m intrigued   the story of us bill sasser ceo an interesting thing happened one day back in  marshall fant and i the two coowners of transpacific management service looked at each other and said “so what should we do with the rest of our lives” from that simple conversation began the greatest and most rewarding professional journey either of us had ever embarked upon but first a bit of backstory marshall and i had been partners since  and had grown transpacific into one of the premier community management firms in southern california both of us brought quite a history to our partnership he began his community management career in  with management service company and i began my own in  with transpacific management company after experiencing years of solid growth together and more specifically both of us reaching certain milestone birthdays it was time for that fateful conversation we explored many options for the company but once we learned of this thing called an esop employee stock ownership plan we immediately knew that was the answer what better way to honor our employees all of whom contributed to the success of the company than by giving them ownership in the company simply put employee ownership felt morally right but then things got really interesting it hit me that i now was responsible to all these new employee owners to grow the business and increase the value of their shares in it one of the ways to achieve both objectives was to invite more companies to join in this new adventure of ours so through  marshall and i shared our vision with a few trusted industry friends for a company that would be national in its scope and impact and one that would represent through our collective employee ownership a paradigm shift for our industry because we are picky about whom we consider friends we offered our vision only with likeminded company owners whom we knew to have the highest integrity and shared our philosophical approach to corporate culture employee ownership values and the community management industry just like that a mere  months after forming our esop the management trust was born the management trust brought together under a single employee ownership structure some of the most well respected community management firms in the western united states including cdc management washington northwest community management oregon kocal management group northern california goetz manderley central california monarch management group california desert transpacific management service southern california after surviving the inevitable bumps and bruises that accompany merging six firms into one we decided it was time to expand the family further we added a las vegas nevada office to our roster and invited a few more firms to join the management trust more recently we have welcomed into the management trust parker finch association services arizona nevada colorado cuellar realty arizona professional management associates colorado tmc management nevada we now serve community associations through washington oregon california nevada arizona and colorado and although we’ve grown considerably over the years we have never lost sight of real purpose to each other or to our clients that purpose is reflected in our mission statement “inspiring each other to take ownership of our potential” to us that means that every relationship is important and must be nurtured to its greatest extent after all conducting business without building strong relationships is neither fun nor much of a recipe for success our attorneys tell us we’re a company but we feel more like a collection of people who take great pride in serving other people that sounds like a pretty good business model to me it has been quite a ride since the management trust’s beginnings in  challenging

do they do posted by super user on thursday  july  in blog     when i think of a board of directors the first thing that comes to mind is a dark lit room with men in suits sipping scotch and joking about their last golf outing funny thing times have changed if you live in a homeowners or a condominium association chances are you have a board of directors these volunteer homeowners are hard at work to meet association needs address pertinent issues and protect the interests of you as a homeowner but how do they get to be on the board and what exactly do they do  how did they get there   your board of directors are elected by the people of the association via a secret ballot and in accordance with local and state laws and your community’s governing documents also known as ccrs and bylaws you may have read them when you purchased your home  in cases of vacant seats directors may be appointed directly by the board    what exactly do they do  the board may choose to contract a management company the management trust for example to assist in developing and achieving the community’s goals in order to maintain common area and increase property value within the community with the assistance of management  board members vote on matters related to the association this might include things like the budget or improvements andor repairs each board member’s vote should represent the needs and wants of all community members and they are expected to make “reasonable and unbiased decisions”   the board is expected to know and understand the communities existing governing documents as well as local laws and statutes pertaining to homeowners associations did you know they even existed board members work together to adopt or change rules  regulations for common areas for the community’s benefit     what can you expect from your management company a great customer experience personalized to meet the needs of your community  a customized plan of action to assist the board of directors in achieving community goals  the ability to provide resources systems tools and training  access to service providers programs and dedicated professionals  last but not least a professional  friendly partnership with your community and board of directors     you and your neighbors deserve to feel confident in your management read more on ways we can partner here     comments

owners management services the management trust  comments continue reading hits   how to pick the best management company for your community posted by super user on wednesday  april  in blog   many think community association management companies are all alike  and for the most part they are probably right  this is because most firms try to shoehorn your community into a “onesize fits all” approach which makes it difficult to adapt to the changing needs of your community  the good news for you is that our unique culture is not bound by our office walls  each of our local offices are filled with employee owners who are empowered to customize management plans to fit your needs as we see it you and your neighbors deserve to have a great experience every time you interact with our staff we could go on and on about all the special things we can do for you and probably will but let’s define how to know you’re getting the best experience when choosing a management company for your community   the contract  you deserve professional management you expect professional management  however the typical industry contract prevents true professional management of your community  this is because most contracts reflect industry practices and standards that have evolved over many years   essentially those contacts place all the burdens of managing your community on the shoulders of you and your fellow directors while absolving management of any and all responsibility even our own actions  clearly that is not in the community’s best interest does not value your precious time and certainly does not allow us to demonstrate our professionalism and leadership abilities we understand that to be a professional means to take responsibility for the things we do and are responsible for  it’s as simple as that  we are committed to making your time serving on the board as pleasurable and rewarding as possible  our new management service agreement is a major step forward towards doing just that   community managers  due to low barriers to entry increased competition little difference in the basic services offered within our industry and various economic factors the community association management industry has become commoditized  the result community managers have become reactive instead of proactive towards the needs of the community  unfortunately it can happen to anyone how do we combat this in an industry rife with turnover  well it’s simple  we listen  it’s one of our best services  by listening our community managers forge strong relationships with our clients and we gain great insights into the needs of the of the communities we represent  the rest is leadership management  think of it this way leadership management is a proactive quantifiable approach to meeting the goals of the community the bottom line is we get it done right    risk protection  do you have peace of mind knowing your community is actively reducing its exposer to risk and liability  do you know what your exposure to risk and liability even is   employing risk management best practices is something your community should take seriously because exposure to financial risks bodily injury and property damage claims is costly our trust risk assessment and compliance program trac trusted partner program for service providers and in house reserve study programs are designed to minimize the risk inherent to special projects by creating strict standards for procedures specifications and insurance to ensure consistent compliance by bidding vendors  in other words we’ve got your back   power to influence the management trust is the only  employeeowned company in the community association management industry structured as an employee stock ownership plan esop we are able to offer potential employees something they cannot get at any other firm in our industry ownership interest in the company this unique offering allows us to attract and retain the top national talent in community association management  the result  we are simply motivated to think differently to do more and to do what is right every day  add to that a culture that encourages and embraces the unique talents that every employeeowner brings to the table and you truly get our best efforts and a great customer experience  we’re good in a different way  can your community association firm say that   give us a call  we’d love to talk  but mostly we’d love to listen tagged in coa hoa home owners management services the management trust  comments continue reading hits   the six bestkept secrets for selling your home posted by super user on monday  april  in blog   it’s no secret that every homeowner strives to sell their home in record time at top dollar and luck can only get you so far with careful planning the proper approach and a little effort your home will be sold in no time at a competitive price the following are six secrets to aid in selling your home   selling secret  make the most of your first impression   it’s true curb appeal matters the first thing potential buyers see is your home’s exterior which provides a snapshot of what they anticipate the inside will look like the goal is to make people feel welcome and safe as they approach their potential new home don’t underestimate the importance of a welcoming entryway immaculate landscaping brightly colored flowers and fresh shrubs will upgrade your home’s initial impression  be sure to leave your outdoor lights on incase prospective buyers drive by at night  lastly once inside create a charming ambiance by displaying a vase of freshcut flowers or even some fresh cookies   selling secret  clean and declutter   now’s the time for the ultimate spring cleaning hire a professional cleaning company for a major deep clean you’ll be moving out soon so start to pack up and donate anything you haven’t used in at least a year too much big furniture will make spaces seem smaller utilize a storage unit and remove excess furniture as a solution this will instantly make your home appear bigger and calmer potential homebuyers are always seeking ample storage in a home in order to be prepared for snooping organize drawers and tidy up cabinets remove half of the stuff in your closet and strategically organize what’s left remove all knickknacks and take a minimalistic approach to kitchen surfaces bathroom countertops decorative rugs and drapery   selling secret  depersonalize   take the home out of your house prospective buyers need to visualize your house becoming their home and it can be difficult for them if all your personal items are displayed remove items that makes your home “your” home such as family photos religious décor and memorabilia maximize the full potential of your house by staging it staging means arranging furniture in a way that showcases the floor plan in the best way possible while maximizing the use of space another staging trick is to exaggerate the light in your home take down drapes open curtainsblindsshades and replace old light bulbs do what you can to make every room light and bright – it will make your home more sellable   selling secret  don’t overupgrade   major home makeovers aren’t always necessary since it’s unlikely that you’ll get your money back before putting your home on the market alternatively make small improvements that won’t break the bank but will help you receive top dollar replace door knobs and cabinet handles with inexpensive new ones adjust closet doors that are off track and fix leaky faucets also a fresh coat of paint will make a huge difference to liven your house cover up bright colors and accent walls with warm natural tones such as light gray offwhite and cream creating a neutral color scheme will help buyers envision how they’ll decorate and add their personal touches   selling secret  spread the word   tell your neighbors that your home is for sale and invite them to your open house more often than not they’re the best salespeople for your home because they can vouch to prospective buyers about how much they love the neighborhood share your home’s listing on social media platforms  the power of the online network is great for widening your reach create a video to post on social media showcasing your home and neighborhood make sure to include what you’ve loved about the house and your favorite nearby spots knowing the home was adored will help potential buyers imagine their life there and making it their own   selling secret  advertise your hoa or coa   living in a wellmanaged community is a huge plus for most people so highlight the perks of your neighborhood increased amenities such as walking trails sports courts swimming pools fitness center or neighborhood parks are also helpful selling points hoas create a friendly and healthy living environment many communities take care of landscaping and gardening needs social events such as a welcoming party for new residents and block parties create community engagement      tagged in coa hoa home owners management services the management trust  comments continue reading hits   community outreach casual for a

management practices committee you have to set the tone and the pace define objectives and strategies demonstrate through personal example what you expect from others –stanley c gault when asked to do this article while looking through the lens of management practices i thought of all the ways that we can set the tone both internally and externally who sets it and how the tone impacts all of our success what exactly is the tone that we want to set i know youve heard this before but we truly believe leadership management is the key to setting the tone here at the management trust it reflects who we are as a company both internally and externally internally we need to remember that as employee owners we are all within our company thats right no matter your position you have to voice and an equal investment in achieving success for all of us how by striving to be a leader that inspires others to provide exceptional customer service or who volunteers to serve on a committee remember simply having a positive attitude can rub off on others to look at their job and the company in a new light that is what leadership management looks like externally our clients and homeowners rely on us to provide top notch customer service we dont just manage homeowners associations we provide leadership management to our boards of directors by providing proactive quantifiable objectives and strategies that are customized for our clients not the cookiecutter approach of so many of our competitors as leaders for our associations we work with boards to develop strategic initiatives that will lead them towards the future or it may be as simple as going the extra mile to help a homeowner who needs to get a tricky arc request resolved quickly whether the issues are financial how we will pay for new roofs physical the landscape is old and tired or administrative finding the best way to deal with a new law we set the tone to demonstrate that we are the leaders who can bring them

time im meeting with a prospective client what are you not accomplishing at your community that youd hoped to the answer is worded a little differently every tie but the gist of it is that they blame their management company for the lack of accomplishment when i ask what their management company is doing to block their path they tell me that it isnt about what their management company is doing its about what the company is not doing not calling them back not emailing them back not getting bids not … you fill in the blank im not one to look up quotes but there is one floating around that says  of success is just showing up i get it but im not sure i entirely agree with it to me showing up is a baseline requirement for competent human beings a core expectation allow me to take poetic license to rephrase  of success is just showing up if you show up ready to hustle without a doubt hustle is the single most important word if success is what were after hustling takes grit it is hard thats why a lot of people dont do it thats also why we can use it to set us apart from every other company in the industry if were willing to dig in ive been down in the trenches and up to the  foot view of this company there is a lot coming at us every day regardless of our position thats okay with me because when a lot comes at us it means were important were relevant somebody needs us of course there are times when it can seem overwhelming weve all got an individual choice to make when the work stacks up faster than we can push it out when that happens weve got two options let it overwhelm us which means we might not even start doing the things we know need to be done dig in recognize our individual capacity for greatness and hustle to get as much done as we can as well as we can possibly do it if we chose option a then it most likely results in a salesperson from another company sitting in front of our client listening to all of the things were not going for them if we chose option b it will result in an undeniable competitive advantage for us we will retain more clients win more business and grow esop value no question now i need to come clean i lied to you about not looking up quotes the little caveat is that i dont look up the quotes themselves i look for people who inspire me and listen to what they have to say nobody inspires me to hustle more than dwayne the rock

word from bill sasser… president  ceo of the management trust posted by super user on friday  october  in blog the ice cream truck scourge i had the honor of delivering the keynote address at our california desert divisions annual director seminar it was a wonderful success and the clients in attendance seemed highly engaged and appreciative of the event during preparations for my presentation i was browsing through various articles in my files and came upon an email forwarded from an industry friend that she received from a homeowner it was so humorous yet disturbing i kept it for posterity the email went something like this margo i find it totally unacceptable that every afternoon i have to listen to the ice cream truck driving around our neighborhood i moved into a gated community to escape the ice cream trucks of the world i insist that you stop them immediately what really when did ice cream trucks become a metaphor for all things that are bad things in this world i remember quite fondly from my youth the sound of the ice cream truck as it approached every afternoon a world of limitless deliciousness heading straight towards me what could be better than than is this homeowners sentiment a symptom of a larger issue i think it is my keynote address spoke of community associations as ecosystems ecosystems are closed systems that sustain themselves through the interdependent relationships of its members think of a forest or the ocean each member contributes to the overall health of the group ecosystems are threatened only when external influences are introduced into it just ask the dinosaurs or our climate for that matter obviously community associations can never be fully closed systems as our homeowners introduce external influences into them every day those influences are the social physical and cultural changes that our world has been experiencing for decades now space limitations do not allow me to explore each of those changes here but i believe this confluence of forces has resulted in the long term decline in social capital in our communities and the world around us one need only to listen to the tone of the current presidential campaign to see that civility has become a rare commodity these days social capital is characterized by trust engagement reciprocity and mutual respect among neighbors and in society in the thirty years ive been in the community management industry it seems to me that the fundamentals of what we do has not changed in all those years yet the business is harder than ever i suspect if you have been in this business for any period of time you feel the same i share with the conference attendees the following model used by the centers for disease control cdc to analyze and predict behaviors called the socialecological model of health it explores the characteristics of the individual age race education income relationships peers family social circles community physical surroundings of workplace school neighborhoods and society social norms laws policies to predict behavior and long term physical and mental health note that these are overlapping not concentric circles this speaks to the fact that each of these four factors influences the others in my presentation i asked the simple questions of our clients as to where they believe the community association falls among these four overlapping circles the answer is all of them the communities that we manage affect the individuals their neighbors and peers the physical setting in which interactions occur and creates and influences policies and social norms not just for its own sake but the larger society as well if our homeowners are bringing into our communities all sorts of external influences then we and our clients need to understand our role in counteracting those influences through the policies tone style and programspractices of our communities acknowledging that everything about the community association touches every aspect of the socialecological model necessitates a new thinking in how we mange them if we believe that our and the associations mission is merely to enforce the ccrs then we need to aim higher our mission should be needs to be – the cultivation of social capital within our communities in every action we take and every policy we make consideration needs to be given to its impact to the overall trust engagement reciprocity and mutual respect offoramong our community members if we are successful in reestablishing such social capital in our communities the very nature of them will change not only will there be a positive change to practical issues such as compliance matters but the communities themselves will begin to enjoy a very different sort of vitality let that be our mission bill sasser president  ceo of the management trust  comments continue reading hits   our take on the california housing market posted by super user on friday  october  in blog california has some of the most expensive housing in the country in the article why california is so expensive its not just the weather its the regulation the author defines the situation with a financial view our very own ccam division president brent kocal gave us his insight and take on the article httpblogslseacukusappblogwhycaliforniaissoexpensiveitsnotjusttheweatheritstheregulation this article demonstrates the classic macroeconomics of supply and demand  governmental restrictions on new development choke supply in the most desirable areas where demand is the highest  the result is higher market value for homes in those areas  i think a couple of things will happen as a result of increased regulation  the first is that home builders will have to push further and further out from city centers to build single family homes in commutable cities starving for economic growth  those cities will likely see home building and development fees as hitting the jackpot  the second thing thats going to happen is that more people will choose to live closer to city centers in more condensed housing units  this will increase demand from homebuyers for homebuilders to develop significant common amenities into their city center developments both of those results play well into homeowners associations  cities further out will want the development cash cow to be as fat as possible and will require homebuilders to install infrastructure and parks that will require owners associations to maintain  developments closer to city centers will have common building maintenance responsibilities in addition to the common amenities – brent kocal ccam division president  comments continue reading hits   surveys a guide for community associations posted by super user on friday  october  in blog boards need to be in touch with residents they need a sense of association members’ opinions and priorities when making decisions for the entire community surveys are an excellent way to obtain feedback on specific subjects and sample general attitudes of community residents boards that seek out and seriously consider resident’s opinions will likely foster a stronger sense of community reduce violations and resident complaints and generally find that residents support their efforts   conducting a community survey might reveal unknown problems or negative attitudes but boards should never be reluctant to undertake surveys for these reasons on the contrary boards have a responsibility to recognize and rectify problems and address the sources of negative attitudes of course the opposite is also true surveys can confirm that the board is on the right track provide support for difficult decisions and demonstrate a board’s due diligence and sound business judgment   boards might also be reluctant to conduct surveys because they feel that the results constitute a mandate however surveys are not votes board members should remember that the information they collect is intended to help them make decisions set priorities and identify issues boards won’t always be able to respond to every issue raised in a survey but they will at least be aware of it and they can factor it into their decision making residents will understand the informationgathering nature of a survey if it includes a cover letter from the board explaining the surveying process and purpose   survey results are an expression of attitudes on specific subjects at one point in time therefore conducting surveys should be a regular–but not excessiveactivity in any association the value of a survey’s results is related to the level and breadth of participation by residents conducting surveys periodically demonstrates to residents and members the value of their views and accustoms residents to sharing those views   there is no perfect research design and associations need not worry about getting it perfect begin modestly with simple surveys on noncritical issues until the volunteer leaders and members become more familiar with the process boards and managers alike will become more comfortable with the process as they get underway  comments continue reading hits   rights  responsibilities for better communities principles for homeowners posted by super user on friday  october  in blog it is with this challenge in mind that community associations institute cai developed rights and responsibilities for better communities rights and responsibilities can serve as an important guidepost for all those involved in the community—board and committee members community managers homeowners and nonowner residents homeowners have the right to a responsive and competent community association honest fair and respectful treatment by community leaders and managers participate in governing the community association by attending meetings serving on committees and standing for election access appropriate association books and records prudent expenditure of fees and other assessments live in a community where the property is maintained according to established standards fair treatment regarding financial and other association obligations including the opportunity to discuss payment plans and options with the association before foreclosure is initiated receive all documents that address rules and regulations governing the community association—if not prior to purchase and settlement by a real estate agent or attorney then upon joining the community appeal to appropriate community leaders those decisions affecting nonroutine financial responsibilities or property rights homeowners have the responsibility to read and comply with the governing documents of the community maintain their property according to established standards treat association leaders honestly and with respect vote in community elections and on other issues pay association assessments and charges on time contact association leaders or managers if necessary to discuss financial obligations and alternative payment arrangements request reconsideration of material decisions that personally affect them provide current contact information to association leaders or managers to help ensure they receive information from the community ensure that those who reside on their property eg tenants relatives friends adhere to all rules and regulations so what do you
