jerrilynn scofield links     lambert strether memo to eliot spitzer if even harvard’s own law firm is more loyal to bain how can you get good legal advice posted on july   by yves smith a commenter in our prior “memo to spitzer” post questioned whether big private equity firms could really be getting away with scamming their investors arguing that …firms are under more scrutiny than ever these days by lps and their attorneys since the financial crisis everything is under spotlight fees fund size deals track record etc firms live in a hyperscrutinized environment these days and it’s hard to believe the entire universe of pe lps would be missing outright criminality notice the straw man we never claimed that the “entire universe” of private equity firms was engaged in “outright criminality” you can have a hell of securities law and contract violations before you hit criminal conduct but we’ll put that aside and deal with the widespread myth private equity is a world of big boys and the limited partner investors are wellinformed welladvised consenting adults if you believe this story it follows that it would be unlikely that anyone could take advantage of them and if so it must have been due to some lapse on their end the problem is we’ve seen what happened in the mortgage backed securities world in a realm of sec registered prospectuses which have much higher disclosure standards than the supersecret limited partnership agreements we saw widespread abuses and an inability of investors to band together effectively or to get any meaningful restitution individually there are many reasons for investor passivity and ineffectiveness but one was that the presumption of an ongoing relationship which you would assume would operate in favor of the customers meaning investors actually worked in favor of the banks many important investors like mutual funds and pension funds didn’t want to rock the boat because they felt the needed to maintain good relationships with the street to get access to product like this erm with product like this less might be better but no one seems to want to think that way as we’ll discuss in later posts we have similar motives at work here you see close analogies to the rmbs problem of hopelessly meek investor representatives and advocates in the private equity world investors in private equity funds technically limited partners or “lps” rely on their outside law firm as their first line of defense against pe firm misconduct outside counsel plays such a critical role because they – far more than the investors themselves – are the ones who review and analyze the fine print of the supersecret limited partnership agreements “lpas” that are the contracts between pe firms and the investors these contracts are always drafted by the private equity firms not by the investors and remember these documents are the only vehicle for the investor to insure that the business is operated for his benefit and not that of the private equity fund sponsor and the central lesson of the mortgage backed securities disaster was that investors incorrectly assumed that a party that had contractual duties actually fulfill those obligations that did not happen in reality because the trusted intermediaries had strong economic incentives not to here are some examples of similar conflicts from the pe world nothing prevents the private equity fund sponsors like bain kkr and blackstone from hiring affiliates that is paying fees to themselves at the expense of the investors except the terms of the contracts one would assume that typical agreements permit the hiring of affiliates as long as the fees are comparable to those paid in an armslength transaction but this language is meaningless if there is no independent party to assess that decision no one to enforce the results of such a review and no one to insure that any affiliated serviceprovider is competent and then executes its duties well that problem could be solved in the agreement in several ways such as having an independent party review everything of value that pe firm affiliates received from portfolio companies and require any proposed affiliate to be disqualified or face automatic clawbacks if fees were too high or require similar independent audits of randonlyselcted transactions for fee and performance levels again with automatic clawbacks and goingforwared prohibitions in the event of violations but the cheapest and most effective way would be simply to bar the pe sponsor from getting paid for any services provided by anyone to a portfolio company since the pe firm is already being paid a management fee and carried interest by the investors who ultimately own the portfolio companies however this approach is effectively never used in the private equity industry we’ve used the example of hiring affiliated companies similar issues apply to every major decision made by the fund sponsor also referred to as the general partner including buyout offers going public transactions dividends and distributions borrowing and other related party transactions and these issues are real like all complex agreements pe lpas can be trojan horses for clever drafting that make the investors think they are getting a particular deal when they are really getting a different inferior one the law firms that review the agreements for lp investors generally have entire practices dedicated to it where the law firm generates economies of scale by reviewing the same lpa multiple times for numerous different clients participating in different closings and where each client is paying the law firm tens of thousands of dollars on one level it is a sweet deal to get paid tens of thousands of dollars to reread the same document over and over and reissue the same memo to lp investors however those fees are chicken feed compared to the fees paid by private equity firms either directly by having the pe firms as a client or indirectly by representing their portfolio companies for example the formation of a new fund can easily generate a million dollars paid by the private equity general partnership likewise a goodsized acquisition for a private equity fund can be a million dollar payday for the pe firm’s outside counsel smaller but very steady legal fees are generated by law firms acting as counsel to companies that the private equity fund general partners like bain and blackstone have acquired for their various funds these portfolio companies also buy and sell companies engage in financings and have routine corporate legal matters and the law firms have them as clients only by staying in the good graces of the private equity fund sponsor this results in a major conflict of interest at big law firms virtually all of them are making much more money from private equity firms either directly or indirectly than they are from the investors in private equity that they also represent and the investors have little in the way of good options since those big law firms are the most expert in the pe space by virtue of all the work they do for the private equity firms themselves the problem of inadequate review and oversight is further compounded by the fact that many investors operate in what amounts to a convoy system they often can’t afford to pay for the fullblown deal and document review process and cynically why should they given that they are not getting an individualized review many simply copy the pe investment decisions of investors recognized as being sophisticated and diligent such as tia creff calpers harvard and yale and do only cursory reviews of their own let’s look at a particularly egregious conflict involving the boston law firm ropes  gray ropes is boston’s ultimate brahmin firm with a pedigree dating back to  past partners including henry cabot lodge and archibald cox industry insiders report that ropes does the legal work for harvard’s investments in private equity funds notably harvard’s endowment is one of the most important pe investors in the world harvard is not only in the top tier of private equity investors in terms of the total size of its commitments but also has a very high percentage of its assets invested in private equity making the strategy critical to the university’s financial well being moreover the harvard management company harvard’s investment arm is widely considered to be sophisticated and well run and is widely viewed as a “thought leader” among pe investors ropes  gray also represents two of boston’s leading pe firms bain capital and thomas h lee partners ropes has long been the main outside counsel to bain capital meaning it almost certainly drafted the some of the agreements it is reviewing for investors like harvard as well as working on numerous other matters for bain at the management company level for bain capital itself and also representing bain funds as well which are legally comprised of bain’s investors and are theoretically legally distinct from bain itself ropes’ name is on literally hundreds of sec filing made by both bain and th lee over a period of decades harvard is an investor in multiple bain and thomas h lee funds you can already see the potential for trouble how can ropes be a fair broker between such high profile players and can it really be an aggressive negotiator for harvard when on a dollars basis bain and thomas h lee are much more lucrative clients and in particular how can you expect ropes to tell harvard about any clever tricks and traps it dreamed up and incorporated in the documents for bain funds in which harvard invested it’s hard to fathom how harvard let this situation arise from its earliest days ropes’ marquee client has been harvard university by contrast the consulting firm bain came into being in  when the ropesharvard relationship was already more than  years old bain capital was founded even later in  harvard could easily have refused to let this situation arise or could have put limits on it but even now despite the large fees harvard management company alone makes to ropes  million in  making ropes harvard’s highest paid provider of any noninvestment service bain and other private equity firms almost certainly pay more to ropes than harvard does in fees which means one has to question how hard ropes would push when their interests are in conflict but wait it’s worse – much worse the march   federal register contained an application to the sec by ropes  gray to form an inhouse  act “investment company” that would be owned by the employees of the firm in order to invest their capital critically as part of its investment company application ropes sought and was granted by the sec an exemption from the normally comprehensive and ongoing public reporting requirements to the sec that investment companies normally provide how has rgip been investing the ropes partners’ money thanks to the sec waiver it’s impossible to know everything but rgip appears regularly as an investor in bain and thomas h lee another top bostonbased pe fund deals pay attention because the distinction i’m about to make is critical to understanding how stinky this is i am not talking about rgip being an investor in bain and thomas h lee funds to the extent that were the case rgip’s interests would be aligned with harvard as a fellow fund investor since they’d be in all the same deals be subject to the same gains and losses and presumably pay the same or similar fees instead ropes  gray harvard’s counsel is investing alongside bain and thomas h lee funds in which harvard is an investor from an economic perspective ropes  gray is investing ahead of harvard because it is not paying the fees a limited partnership investor pays moreover it may well be in an even more advantaged position by virtue by getting access to only the best deals as in cherrypicking within the funds and could potentially better rights on other fronts than its client the proof from the dunkin brands prospectus the validity of the issuance of the shares of common stock to be sold in this offering will be passed upon for us by ropes  gray llp boston massachusetts some attorneys of ropes  gray llp are members in rgip llc which is a direct investor in dunkin’ brands group inc and is also an investor in certain investment funds affiliated with bain capital partners llc and thomas h lee partners lp rgip llc directly and indirectly owns less than  of our common stock and is a selling stockholder in this offering the validity of the common stock offered hereby will be passed upon on behalf of the underwriter by simpson thacher  bartlett llp new york new york the key language here is “direct investor” in the company that means it holds shares rather than holding a limited partnership interest in a private equity fund from the sungard prospectus some partners of ropes  gray llp are members in rgip llc which is an investor in certain investment funds affiliated with certain of the sponsors the pe firms of which bain capital was one and often a coinvestor with such funds rgip llc owns directly and indirectly shares of the capital stock of our equityissuing parent companies representing less than  of the outstanding shares of stock of each such company and here are more links to deal documents filed with the sec showing rgip as a coinvestor with bain httpwwwsecgovarchivesedgardatavexahtm httpwwwsecgovarchivesedgardataexhibitehtm httpwwwsecgovarchivesedgardatagexvhtm how do we know investing in the portfolio companies directly is a better deal than investing at a fund level the limited partners themselves say so from a march article in pensions  investments “many large institutions are clamoring for coinvestments because most coinvestments are made on a nofee nocarriedinterest basis said david fann president and ceo of san diegobased consulting firm torreycove capital partners llc” … “the push is from limited partners that want to coinvest to drive down the cost of investing in private equity and to gain control over investments mrdelaney brown of the uk activist investor hermes gpe said let’s understand how the economics work rgip owns shares directly in bainthomas h lee fund portfolio companies when those companies pay a dividend it’s a near certainty that  of the dividend amount from its shares flows directly into rgip’s coffers the fund investors by contrast could get as little as none of that same dividend if that particular cash flow occurs during the “ to gp catchup” portion of the waterfall generally speaking it’s well nigh impossible for a private equity firm to bring in a coinvestor on a single deal and have that coinvestor situated exactly parri passu with its fund investors in terms of economic and legal exposure a basic reason for that is that the cash flows that get paid out to fund lps on a particular deal are calculated based on the prior cash flows of all the fund’s other deals if the coinvestor is in just one or a subset of all of the fund’s deals it would be impossible to replicate that provision for them further there is no point to seek coinvestor status unless one is getting a better deal than the fund otherwise one might as well invest in the fund and avoid the administrative cost of managing the investments directly thus the bottom line according to one pe insider i consulted is rgip’s deal must be different than the fund investors in some respect which means that rgip is not fully aligned with the interest of fund investors like harvard and it is extremely likely that rgip’s deal is better than fund investors’ deal as that is the generally recognized purpose of pe investors seeking coinvestments rather than simply signing up to funds as bad as all of this seems we have either peculiar ineptness or an effort at obfuscation by bain in some of its descriptions of rgip and the role played by law firms generally bain portfolio companies have repeatedly mischaracterized the relationship between rgip and bain in sec filings over the years claiming that rgip is an arm of bain even though it is clearly not for example here is an sec filing by bain where in a footnote it refers to rgip as an affiliate of one of its funds  includes  shares of stock owned by bcip associates ii  shares of stock owned by bcip associates iic  shares of stock owned by bcip trust associates ii  shares of stock owned by bcip associates iib and  shares of stock owned by bcip trust associates iib  shares of stock owned by pep investments pty ltd  shares of stock owned by sankaty high yield asset partners lp and  shares of stock owned by rgip llc affiliates of bain capital fund vi lp now in secspeak the term “affiliate” has a very precise legal meaning which is that an entity controls is controlled by or under common control with another entity there is no way that rgip is an affiliate of a bain fund the sec would almost certainly view this misstatement as an unintentional foot fault unworthy of sanction but one does wonder whether in fact the false disclosure was done deliberately to mask the role of the lawyers coinvesting in the deal but if that statement is a foot fault what about this having been dragged into the supervision of the sec by dodd frank bain now maintains a public form adv in that form bain makes the following apparently misleading disclosure about the investment activities of its law firms partners of the law firms engaged to represent the funds may be investors in the funds and may also represent one or more portfolio companies or limited partners of the funds note that bain language conveniently omits what its and the thomas h lee filings have repeatedly disclosed about rgip which is that the partners of law firms invest in the deals directly as a “direct investor” rather than in the funds of course the finesse may be that pe fund partners do invest in bain funds as do some employees of investment banks but rgip is not a partner of a law firm but an investment vehicle so the disclosure is arguably narrowly accurate if substantively misleading and in case you think the behavior we’e uncovered is infrequent language from other bain disclosures indicates otherwise the clear channel prospectus another bain deal discloses specifically that it isn’t just unnamed “partners of law firms” but that is it specifically ropes that both invests in the funds and is “often” an investor in the portfolio companies the validity and enforceability of the exchanges notes and the related guarantees offered hereby will be passed upon for us by ropes  gray llp boston massachusetts ropes  gray llp and some partners of ropes  gray llp are members of rgip llc which is an investor in certain investment funds associated with the sponsors and often a coinvestor with such funds rgip llc owns directly and indirectly shares of capital stock of holdings representing less than  of the outstanding shares of stock of holdings this adv disclosure earlier also suggests yet another whopping conflict of interest on the part of bain’s lawyers which given all of the disclosures above is almost certainly ropes  gray if you combine this adv disclosure with all the other sec disclosures from this post it appears that ropes  gray represents not only harvard “…may also represent one or more limited parters” as a single lp in bain funds but simultaneously ropes represents all of the partners collectively “…the law firms engaged to represent the funds…”the fund is the entity comprised of the limited partners and the general partner so ropes is professing to provide fair and objective advice when it appears to be on every side of these transactions imaginable as counsel for bain capital as counsel to the bain funds as counsel to some investors individually harvard in certain cases to the portfolio companies and with at least some firm partners acting through a firmsponsored investment vehicle as a direct investor in particular deals i contacted ropes  gray the harvard management bain capital and thomas h lee for comment ropes  gray harvard management and bain did not respond and thomas h lee declined to comment understand the issue here i am not saying that ropes  gray is doing something technically impermissible lawyers are expected to get waivers when they are representing clients who have conflicts of interest and presumably ropes got one from harvard similarly the fact that ropes represents both bain as a fund sponsor and the fund itself as a separate legal entity would certainly be disclosed in bain’s fund offering documents one does wonder however why on earth harvard would have ever granted ropes a conflict waiver along these lines on the other hand the lps would almost certainly not have been notified of ropes’ conflict of interest in representing them corporately as fund counsel while also coinvesting alongside them the reason for this is that bain itself as the fund’s general partner is the party that would waive the conflict between ropes acting as fund counsel while coinvesting alongside the fund as the gp bain is designated as the agent for the fund and its investors in this respect and can therefore signoff on egregious conflicts of interest on the part of the fund counsel ropes appears to be exploiting what is effectively a loophole in the structure of private equity funds where the gp is the legal agent for the lps in order to get signoff on a massive conflict of interest with the lps so look at the money and power imbalances on issues where the bain’s and thomas h lee’s interests are directly opposed to harvard’s how aggressive an advocate do you expect ropes to be the very fact that they are coinvestors with the private equity kahunas is an awfully strong indicator of where they think their real interests lie and this picture is broadly replicated without the rgip kicker at every firm considered to be top drawer in this field so even if harvard were to become disaffected it’s highly unlikely that it can get better representation elsewhere in the end the question is for spitzer or whoever is the next new york city comptroller who can you really trust to represent your interests in as outside counsel advising you on private equity investing given the state of legal ethics even at white shoe law firms like ropes  gray  the parties that have had the best track records so far are not investors but bond insurers and that is by virtue of having better contractual rights most important access to loan files than mbs investors this is very plausible in the case of bain deals as bain’s lead outside firm ropes would have ongoing communications with the partners and one would expect would often be chosen as counsel to handle acquisitions for various bain funds serving as deal counsel would make ropes an active part of the due diligence process that would give ropes a considerable information advantage over the limited partner investors and allow the law firm to pick and choose on the basis of privileged information  subscribe to post comments  comments chris e july   at  am i think if anyone would be responsive to concerns like this it would be spitzer right now may not the best time given he’s in hyper campaign mode but once he’s elected i bet if you contact his people you’ll get some kind of response to wonkier type of issues like this heck you may be able to get a sitdown interview with him pe is the most ungodly unity of lawyers and banksters it comes as no surprise to me that you’ve discovered cases where they give “friendly” law firms direct investor preference rather than channelling them into into individual funds as lps and that actors like rg are playing both sides in the deals set up i can’t imagine that spitzer would ignore evidence of a rather clear conflict of interest like this i think sard was running his pr before but i don’t know who is the gatekeeper now but someone who may be closer to him should forward these “memos” and get him to at least acknowledge the issues john july   at  am has anyone tied suing the law firms involved for ethics violations if not may spitzer can be the first to do so maroonbulldog july   at  pm the big law firms control the state bar regulators who write the “ethics” rules of professional responsibilty under which those big law firms might be sued and if you’re proposing to sue one big law firm you might need to hire another big law firm to do it since big law firms may be able to swamp small law firms under piles of pleadings motiions and discovery requests and the big law firm you hire may have other practice groups doing the same kind of deals that you are propsoing to sue over all of which is to say that suing a big law firm might be throwing good money after bad ima s july   at  pm the last honest man to work at ropes  gray was former massachusetts chief judge and harvard law professor robert braucher who quit in  braucher was the only good thing about harvard law school when i was there in  he died some time in the seventies everybody on the inside knows the assumed rectitude and professionalism of these law firms is a crock they push paper and cash checks and probably don’t even dress like gentlemen any more anon july   at  am except if you are the nyc comptroller overseeing more than a hundred billion dollars in public investments who can offer a very lucrative deal to a law firm winning such a case and recovering a couple of billion dollars judgement or settlement – in addition to becoming the future law firm of choice for both the comptroller and other investors who don’t want to be scammed financial incentives cut both ways a big investor can indeed rock the boat yves is right it’s amazing how harvard allowed this situation to arise sd july   at  am  wealthy alumni endow chairs at harvard university  when the alum need legal advice they use a law firm peppered with harvard alumni  those lawyers eventually become judges  the old boys network goes on to protects its own in perpetuity mcmike july   at  am participating on every imaginable side of a deal just like the wall street banks yet still allowed to enjoy perks and preferences that come with the status of alleged fudiciary and honest broker truly emblematic of a thoroughly broken system where conflict of interest has become the pervasive norm charger july   at  am superb work thank you for sharing this advocate july   at  am the nature of pe is all about loopholes and especially tax avoidance don’t blame the playa blame the game applying the same thought process for public securities to pe is apples and dumptrucks the author is making assumptions based on appearances only which on their face make some sense but do you really think big law firms lack internal controls around conflict of interest one would think that the author has never worked in a law firm jehr july   at  am yes i do fred july   at  am you have clearly articulated ropes  gray’s defense “conflicts are everywhere in a big law firm what’s the big deal” the point here is that ropes has taken the typical law firm’s conflicts in acting as an agent for multiple principal parties at different points in time and put those conflicts on steroids by making itself a principal party further why would harvard ever reasonably grant a waiver for such a powerful conflict harvard clearly had the power to deny one but didn’t because it shares the same attitude that you do that gross conflicts are no big deal because hey everybody at ropes went to harvard law school or harvard college and therefore must be a paragon of virtue anon july   at  am the point is that pe and in particular leveraged loan driven buyouts are a leading tax loophole investors might not mind being scammed via inflated fees of  if those fees are still less than the capital gains tax of  especially if some of the excess “fees” are investments into off shore corporate entities suggested by the investor of course a public entity like nyc does not need to evade taxes and thus has different interests gerard pierce july   at  am excellent article it illustrates some ideas that i have never clearly articulated but which might be part of the path to cleaning up this broken system the comes a point where tptb become so rapacious that they start trying to survive by eating each others liver the financial system can no longer make an adequate return by screwing the average man a large parts of the legal system has lost profitability as indicated by the associates that either didn’t get hired or who have been “unhired” transferring the work to india might be a shortterm solution but it still remains that there is a lot of highpowered legal talent out there looking for someone to sue as members of the  our final solution is to demand bread and enjoy the circus matthew cunninghamcook july   at  pm from the lp agreements with public pension funds that i’ve been able to get my hands on this kind of language is common “ a director of the company shall forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to b e entered into by the company disclose the interest to all other directors of the company  for the purposes of article  a disclosure to all other directors to the effect that a director is a member director or officer of another named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with respect to the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction which may after the date of the entry into the transaction or disclosure of the interest be entered into with that entity or individual is a sufficient disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction  a director of the company who is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the company may a vote on a matter relating to the transaction b attend a meeting of directors at which a matter relating to the transaction arises and be included among the directors present at the meeting for the purposes of a quorum and c sign a document on behalf of the company or do any other thing in his capacity as a director that relates to the transaction and subject to compliance with the act shall not by reason of his office be accountable to the company for any benefit which he derives from such transaction and no such transaction shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit” makes these conflicts even easier to do dikaios logos july   at  pm yves really really great stuff while things like mortgage fraud have harmed poor people directly the fact that bain lps like hmc are also vulnerable to finance bs is very important and should be made much more widely known i hope this sort of thing can help us get more converts to the cause of reigning in this behavior one thing jumped out at me though “it’s hard to fathom how harvard let this situation arise” i really disagree with this for a number of reasons first the recent decades and perhaps time before that has featured a few insiders enjoying a sort of supersuper tranche of cash flows from entities whether it is bank ceos enlarging balance sheets to inflate their comp or professional services firms bilking hmc by playing with the alignment of interests these entities are almost never functioning as the standard narrative assumes rather they become the cash cow for some psychopath eg willard romney who knows just a bit more than everyone else and can play a rigged game because of it second there is a culture embedded at harvard and other ‘elite’ institutions that takes lewis lapham’s dictum of ‘assuming that by doing well one is also doing good’ very very seriously in other words for the merely uppermiddle class harvard grad to preserve his conceits about his superiority he has to look to those from harvard who have done even better in  terms with great awe not cynicism i have seen this play out with investment committees and staff on a few occasions once in the months before the lehman collapse i told the investment staff of a large  figure  assets highvisibility nonprofit with large commitments to the poor that they their overly pe weighted portfolio with all the biggest name funds presented serious liquidity risks they laughed out loud at me especially the hbs grad in the room those guys in big buyout firms had to know what they were doing i also served on a smaller nonprofit’s investment committee and took serious grief from a couple of hbs buffoons and a top financial regulator for saying that our broker was a salesperson not a fiduciary third and finally virtually everyone who knows enough to prevent this is easily coopted there is a revolving door between bain hmc and ropes but most of those people are looking not to preserve harvard but to enrich themselves i have heard ropes attorneys speak of “ones that got away” basically fish stories about bain deals that they felt they should have invested in when they had a chance i have never heard hmc staff or ropes attorneys speak of protecting clients or fulfilling their fiduciary duties never in spite of my need for that digression i know this is a killer post i will read and reread it even though i was already moderately well versed in these details and i really hope everyone who cares about harvard reads this too synopticist july   at  pm very interesting article thank you if harvard get screwed over by their own lawyers what chance do small institutions have jess july   at  pm my latin is a little rusty but i think the phrase is “custodus effsus custodus” translated as “who shall watch the watchers” a friend of mine calls those eight schools in the northeast the “poison ivy league” anybody ever watch that series “suits” about the guy with the photographic memory who impersonates a harvard law grad to get a job with a firm that only hires harvard alums would love to see a series like that where the firm sets out to screw its clients the public everybody in every way that it can scotts july   at  pm many important investors like mutual funds and pension funds didn’t want to rock the boat because they felt the needed to maintain good relationships with the street to get access to product like this erm with product like this less might be better but no one seems to want to think that way – this food is poisoned – and such small portions too lambert strether july   at  pm what a bucket of snakes “so look at the money and power imbalances” indeed we really need a replacement phrase for “top drawer” perhaps something drawn from the inferno kokuanani july   at  am wonderful article yves i hope you’ve sent a copy to matt taibbi and of course to eliot spitzer perhaps elizabeth warren and her staff might find this of interest as well thisson july   at  pm also note that while the  act application purported to establish a firm owned by “employees” the rgip fund is owned by the partners of the firm not the employees

are found with a combined frequency of  our pancreas center manages a population which is  aj providing a means of efficiently screening this population for brcabrca founder mutations we hypothesized that our population would have an increased carrier frequency of brcabrca founder mutations methods this is a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing surgical resection for adenocarcinoma or preneoplastic lesions of the pancreas at a single institution between  and  all specimens were reviewed by an experienced pathologist genomic dna was isolated from deidentified normal tissue adjacent

activation of the jakstat signaling obr expression has been reportedly detected in humanand rodent colonic tumors and as well as in human colon cancer cell lines in the presentstudy we explored whether leptin stimulate the colorectal carcinogenesis methods therelationship between serum leptin concentration and colorectal carcinogenesis were evaluated carcinoma n adenoma n and

population pvalues the maximum percentage aj in ourcohort is  which would produce an estimated total brcabrca carrier frequencyof  pvalue conclusions an increased frequency of brca and brca ajfounder mutation carriers is seen within our patient cohort while the high frequency ofbrcabrca mutations detected may result from a higher than expected number of ajpatients in our patient population it is likely that  aj is accurate based upon ourprevious studies these data do not necessarily suggest a causative role for brcabrcamutations in pdac although they may suggest other important genes
