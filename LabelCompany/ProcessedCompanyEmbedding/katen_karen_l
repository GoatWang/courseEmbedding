business biographies fl karen katen — biography karen katen – executive vice president pfizer president pfizer global pharmaceuticals nationality american born  in kansas city missouri education university of chicago ba  mba  career pfizer – marketing associate in roerig division then marketing and generalmanagement positions – vice president of marketing – vice president and director of operations – vice president and general manager – executive vice president of pfizer pharmaceuticals group – president of pfizer global pharmaceuticals and corporate executive vice president awards  most powerful women in business fortune  –  top executives businessweek   address pfizer  east nd street new york new york  httpwwwpfizercom ■ karen l katen was executive vice president of pfizer as well as president of pfizer global pharmaceuticals the companys principal operating division and held a seat on the companys board of directors after joining pfizer in  katen was involved in the marketing of virtually every major drug launched by the company her group produced eight of the worlds top  pharmaceutical products including the worlds top seller lipitor with annual sales approaching  billion described as one of pfizers most respected leaders katen was known for disseminating knowledge throughout the organization building strong crossfunctional teams and championing collaboration college and early professional direction a native of kansas city missouri karen katen attended the university of chicago where she graduated in  with a bachelors degree in political science katen landed a job in karen katen lawrence luciergetty images  sales at an office supply company shortly after graduation after one year on the job she returned to the university of chicago and earned her mba in  a focused career katen joined pfizer in  as a marketing associate in the roerig division from the beginning she found a perfect fit for herself in marketing and management eventually holding several management posts within the us pharmaceutical division including vice president of marketing in  vice president and director of operations in  and vice president and general manager in  she was named executive vice president of the pfizer pharmaceuticals group in  by  she was promoted again to president of pfizer us pharmaceuticals in  katen assumed responsibility for global business in more than  countries as president of pfizer global pharmaceuticals katens roles entailed direct management of worldwide medical and regulatory activities and the worldwide development of pharmaceutical products she was also a member of the prestigious pfizer leadership team a solid record of achievement throughout her career at pfizer katen developed and implemented several core strategies that though considered givens by todays management thinkers were nevertheless in their time quite innovative while most industry executives maintained that their companies products were prescription medicines katen reframed the conceptual model in asserting that pharmaceuticals was essentially a knowledge business grounded in intellectual capital fundamentally she told molly rose teuke of chief executive  what we do is transfer scientific knowledge to physicians and increasingly to patients their families and their communities july  this distinction became central in her drive to distribute knowledge throughout pfizers many internal functions—functions which were often encapsulated by silo mentalities at other companies indeed as noted by teuke katen was known to have a paperweight on her desk with the inscription who else needs to know july —a question alluding to the ongoing need to share information katen asserted knowledge is a company asset not the property of any individual and thats our greatest strength july  at a time when many senior executives saw the dissemination of knowledge as a threat to their corporate fiefdoms katen applied the principle of knowledge dissemination relentlessly thus propelling pfizer to become a marketing powerhouse her philosophy was evident in pfizers share fairs at pfizer meetings employees displayed good practice posters enabling colleagues to learn about the latest best practices whoever wanted to implement a new concept could borrow the poster in question on the condition that they share a good practice of their own all of a meetings participants could take two posters and display two posters of their own ensuring the dynamic dissemination of knowledge katen noticed that the delivery of pharmaceuticals as part of the delivery of health care in general was an inherently local enterprise as such global companies like pfizer needed to adapt their messages to consumers in ways that suited local cultural and demographic conditions here too katen fostered an environment of local empowerment by the mids breaking a longstanding tradition of launching products one market at a time over the course of a decade under katens leadership pfizer localized product launches so that any given product was distributed throughout  markets within  months during her tenure at pfizer katens achievements fell into three general categories blockbusters partnerships and the sales force in terms of blockbusters during the s katen helped launch  innovative pharmaceuticals produced by pfizers research and development program including viagra for erectile dysfunction lipitor to lower cholesterol zyrtec an allergy medicine zoloft for depression celebrex for arthritis pain norvasc for hypertension and the leading antibiotic zithromax with respect to partnerships before pfizers  acquisition of the company in  katen engineered a lucrative comarketing deal with warnerlambert to help market its cholesterollowering drug lipitor which became the numberone lipidlowering agent in the united states by  finally katen oversaw the addition of  representatives to pfizers sales force which was one of the most respected in the industry with two key acquisitions in the early s—warnerlambert in  and pharmacia in —katen managed the largest integrations in the history of the us pharmaceutical industry as a result of both internal growth and these acquisitions revenues for the global pharmaceuticals group reached  billion in —nine times greater than  revenues management philosophy and leadership style katens management style was the very antithesis of the classic topdown authoritarian approach she was well known for her ability to build cohesive teams within a highly competitive company she assembled crossfunctional groups to launch products a strategy that proved very successful as team members worked together for the full period—often  to  years—during which a product was undergoing clinical trial and awaiting regulatory approval she encouraged open communication among individuals from various functions including scientists physicians salespeople and marketers both before and after food and drug administration product approval the resulting sense for the need to communicate openly filtered down throughout the organization permitting crossfunctional team members to address issues quickly katen was known for fully developing the people working under her peter brandt the senior vice president for finance planning and business development at the pfizer pharmaceuticals group told john slania of the university of chicago graduate school of business karen truly believes in and cares about her people she realizes the importance of developing people and she does that by pushing them—keeping their feet to the fire—and also by providing them with the resources and support to get the job done march  dr joseph feczko pfizer pharmaceuticals groups senior vice president for medical and regulatory operations offered slania this perspective she relies very heavily on the experience and technical knowledge of the physicians in her group but shes not intimidated while shes a bottomline type of person she brings a human face to the business shes interested in doing the right thing even if its not supportive of the bottom line march  this attitude was evident when katen supported the pfizer ceo dr henry a mckinnells initiative to provide pfizers antifungal drug diflucan to aids patients in africa free of charge a soaring reputation katen was one of the most highly respected women in the pharmaceutical industry managing a larger business unit than any other female manager in the industry her stature was evident from her membership in the industrys leading organization the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers association of america as well as a member of the boards of directors for general motors the harris corporation and the rand corporation and was a trustee of the university of chicago and a council member of its graduate school of business she served on the boards of directors of several
