our strategy to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth nongaap earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance range driven by strength in both qtl and qct qtl revenues reflect seasonably strong december quarter activity and we are pleased with the progress we are making in china we signed several new china licenses in the first few months with more than  companies now having accepted the ndrc national development and reform commission terms we remain in active discussions with the few key chinese oems that have not yet signed and believe we are making progress in those discussions we are also pleased to have recently resolved our licensing dispute with lg in qct our chipset shipments were above the midpoint of our prior guidance range driven by strong demand from chinese oems and we had favorable product costs during the quarter we returned approximately  billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases we also announced a  increase in our quarterly cash dividend reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth we remain focused on improving our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year and we are on track in this regard in qct we have updated our roadmap across tiers and our new products have been very well received the flagship snapdragon  is now available in leading devices such as the samsung galaxy s the lg g and the xiaomi mi along with devices from sony htc hp and others we now have over  snapdragon  designs and expect volume to ramp on this platform through the second half of the fiscal year our strategy of offering differentiated allmode modem solutions with carrier aggregation capability is extending our leadership and enabling strong design traction particularly in china at the mid and high tiers in china new use cases for carrier aggregation are providing product differentiators for our customers and enhancing our design traction we are continuing to pursue additional content opportunities in the smartphone and recently announced a suite of nextgeneration qualcomm rf technologies we are on track to deliver our nextgeneration cmos and galliumarsenid pas in  and will extend our product offerings including complete rf frontend module solutions once the tdk transaction closes further we are broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities including automotive networking mobile compute and iot collectively the serviceable addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a cagr of  over the next five years from  billion to  billion according to a combination of thirdparty and internal estimates and we are well positioned to benefit from this expanding opportunity we expect these adjacent opportunities to drive approximately  billion in qct revenues in fiscal year  we are seeing significant momentum across these areas in automotive we have very strong design traction in telematics across tier  manufacturers with the completion of our csr acquisition we now have a comprehensive connectivity portfolio including bluetooth smart wifi and lte which allows us to offer a broader suite of products to our expanded set of customers in networking we have a strong pipeline of over  designs with our ac solution across router home gateway and settop box implementations we continued to gain significant traction and win categorydefining designs in iot segments such as wearables action cameras security and surveillance cameras virtual reality headsets drones and smart city infrastructure at mwc we announced ecosystem expansion for our nextgeneration snapdragon wear platform and we are pleased to report that there are now over  wearable devices using qualcomm technology which includes over  of all android wear smartwatch designs looking at the iot more broadly there are now over  billion iot devices that have shipped using qualcomm technology we continue to forecast qct operating margins of  or better in the fourth fiscal quarter and are targeting plus operating margins longer term it is important to note that for planning purposes both our nearterm and longterm margin targets have consistently factored in a range of second sourcing assumptions at our large customers and we believe our margin targets are achievable under those scenarios we have strong confidence in our technology leadership differentiated modem roadmap and unique global scale for instance we recently demonstrated our snapdragon x lte modem the first commercially announced gigabitclass lte chipset designed to deliver fiberlike lte category  download speeds of up to  gigabit per second at least two generations ahead of the competition this modem also supports licensed assisted access the global standard for lte in unlicensed spectrum becoming the mobile industrys first commercially announced lte advanced pro modem and marks an important step towards g as we enable deeper unlicensed spectrum integration with lte and more advanced mimo techniques to support growing data consumption further we are leading the world to g as we did in both g and g to support this we are designing a new ofdmbased g air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the internet of things and new types of missioncritical services that require lower latency higher reliability and robust security we demonstrated our g millimeter wave  ghz prototype system at mobile world congress showcasing robust and sustained mobile broadband communications at these higher spectrum bands looking ahead we continue to execute on our strategic plans to position us well for the future fiscal  is a transition year and we are making very good progress we are taking decisive steps to enable us to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead while delivering improving nearterm performance i would now like to turn the call over to derek derek k aberle  president thank you steve and good afternoon everyone as steve noted qtl had a stronger than expected fiscal second quarter with total reported device sales of approximately  billion reflecting the seasonally strong holiday quarter i am pleased to report that we recently resolved our dispute with lg as a result of the resolution we will resume recognizing quarterly lg revenues in fiscal q in addition to recording the revenues we deferred from the first two fiscal quarters as a reminder lg continued to report and pay during the dispute so the sales they reported for the first two quarters of fiscal  were included in the total reported device sales for those quarters but we did not recognize revenues for those quarters given that the arbitration was underway we are also continuing to make steady progress in china completing new china license agreements we recently signed new agreements with lenovo ewpe yulong and hisense and now have more than  companies that have accepted the ndrc terms including the top five worldwide chinese licensees yulong and hisense were signed after the close of our second fiscal quarter and will be reflected in our third quarter results in addition we are still actively negotiating with several of the other remaining key chinese oems and are making progress in those discussions as we explained at our analyst day in february we are also working hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance with our licensees in china we have begun implementing those plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time the percentage of global units not reported to us during the second fiscal quarter increased modestly quarter over quarter driven primarily by share gains from oems that have been withholding royalties during license negotiations looking ahead we continue to see growth in global gg device shipments lte penetration is only approximately  of cellular connections globally and cumulative smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than  billion from  through  according to gsm intelligence and gartner for calendar year  we now estimate global gg device shipments were approximately  billion units slightly below the midpoint of our prior range and up approximately  year over year we saw strong growth in emerging regions particularly in china and expect this trend to continue in calendar  we are adjusting our estimate of calendar  global gg device shipments to  billion to  billion devices with yearoveryear unit growth of approximately  at the midpoint down from our previous midpoint estimate of approximately  growth the strong g ramp in china continues as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their gplus service offerings and design momentum is moving rapidly towards allmode devices across china the strength in china however is being offset by a reduction in growth rates in other emerging regions which we believe is attributable to macroeconomic headwinds in addition our forecast for premiumtier device shipments is down slightly versus our prior view driven by slower than expected upgrades within one of the premiumtier ecosystems global gg handset asps are tracking slightly better than our prior expectations of an approximately  yearoveryear decline for the fiscal year driven primarily by stronger premiumtier asps we continue to expect low singledigit growth in global gg device sales in fiscal  as unit growth is expected to more than offset asp declines despite adjustments to nearterm shipment estimates we believe the longterm growth drivers for gg device sales remain intact and provide a solid foundation for the licensing business to deliver greater than  billion in revenue in our fiscal  turning to our qtl revenue outlook for fiscal  despite weaker than expected unit shipments for the fiscal year we continue to expect qtl revenues to be in the range of  billion to  billion given the weaker than expected gg device demand we will need to make some additional progress on signing the remaining license agreements in china in order to be within that range but continue to feel that is achievable as we said at our analyst day although there will be quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide we estimate a normalized rate for fiscal  will be approximately  this is based on adjusting for onetime items and other anomalies such as a difference in timing between when revenues for catchup payments are recognized and when the related trds may be reported in conclusion we continue to make good progress in china and are pleased to have resolved the lg dispute we are keenly focused on concluding the right longterm agreements with the remaining china licensees as well as improving compliance and expect continued progress throughout the rest of the fiscal year that concludes my comments and i will now turn the call over to george george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you derek and good afternoon everyone fiscal second quarter nongaap revenues were  billion and nongaap earnings per share were  up  sequentially and above the high end of our prior guidance range in qct msm shipments were  million  above the midpoint of our prior guidance reflecting stronger demand in china qct revenues were  billion with a sequentially higher implied revenue per msm qct operating margin was  toward the high end of our prior expectations in qtl total reported device sales and revenues benefited from strength in both developed and emerging regions during the holiday quarter as a reminder we report qtl on a onequarter lag so these results reflect the strength of fourth calendar quarter holiday demand qtl results also include a onetime revenue benefit of  million resulting from the merger of two infrastructure licensees as we forecasted on last quarters call this was partially offset by the end of a multiyear license fee amortization of approximately  million per quarter as well as the impact of the lg dispute revenue deferral which will now be included in our fiscal third quarter results consistent with the settlement announced today nongaap combined rd and sga expenses decreased  sequentially slightly less than our guidance range due to an increase in legal and litigation related expenses we returned approximately  billion to stockholders in the quarter including approximately  million of dividends paid and  billion in stock repurchases at an average price of approximately  per share we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of  billion our nongaap tax rate during the quarter was  consistent with our expected rate for the full year now turning to fiscal  in qtl as derek indicated we continue to forecast revenues will be between  billion to  billion despite a weaker overall trds outlook for the year in qct we continue to see improving demand for premium and hightier devices in the second half of the fiscal year offset by reduced demand for thin modem products and lowtier chipsets we remain on track for operating margin of  or better in the fourth fiscal quarter we also remain on track to meet the  billion reduction in spending under the strategic realignment plan and we continue to expect at least  million of savings in fiscal  relative to the srp baseline ahead of our original  million target a summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website we continue to expect fiscal  nongaap combined rd and sga expenses will be down approximately  to  year over year which includes the fullyear impact of acquisitions of approximately  adjusting for ma estimated spending in these areas would be down  to  year over year turning to our fiscal third quarter we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately  billion to  billion up approximately  sequentially at the midpoint driven by strong product mix in qct and the favorable lg dispute resolution in qtl including catchup revenues from priorperiod activity we estimate nongaap earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be approximately  to  per share down approximately  year over year at the midpoint we expect fiscal third quarter nongaap combined rd and sga expenses will be approximately flat sequentially in qtl fiscal third quarter revenues will include recognition of more than  million that was deferred in the first fiscal and second quarters related to the lg dispute resolution separately we estimate total reported device sales between  billion and  billion will be reported by our licensees in the june quarter for shipments they made in the march quarter down sequentially compared to the seasonally high holiday quarter shipments we have not included any potential benefit from license agreements under negotiation consistent with our prior practice we expect qtls operating margin percentage to be down sequentially in line with seasonal trends reflecting the first calendar quarter in qct we anticipate msm shipments of approximately  million to  million units during the june quarter and expect revenue per msm to be up more than  sequentially we expect qct operating margin to improve sequentially and be in the range of  to  for the fiscal third quarter these expectations reflect the benefit of a stronger chip roadmap on both performance and cost leadership across tiers favorable product mix growth in adjacent opportunities and lower operating expenses that concludes my comments i will now turn the call back to warren warren kneeshaw  vice presidentinvestor relations thank you george operator we are ready for questions

faucette  morgan stanley  co llc hello can you hear me now warren kneeshaw  vice presidentinvestor relations yes we can hear you james james e faucette  morgan stanley  co llc hello okay im sorry so i just had a couple of quick questions first i just want to clarify the comments around qtl and its potential licensing should we take from your comments that the risk of it potentially falling outside of or below the targeted range for this year have gone up or are you just trying to clarify that and i guess my second question is related and that is as you continue to pursue licensing agreements with some of the larger chinese oems with whom you dont have agreements does it reach a stage or when do we reach a stage that you may have to start to pursue legal options through the courts there and what would that look like thanks george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president great thanks james on the range of  billion to  billion our point was the range was initially defined solely by the outcomes based on our market assumptions at the beginning of the year if we were able to if we werent able to make much progress we saw ourselves ending up at about  billion in qtl on the licensing agreements if we made significant progress that could take us to  billion obviously the lg issue from last quarter created some confusion we said that was really outside the range now that that has been resolved what were saying is that the end market is softer than we had anticipated when we set the range up front and thats pulled down the overall size of the market so we would have to make up some of that in the form of some additional progress on the licensing agreements and we feel that were making progress there so it would be premature to say that we dont believe that well end up somewhere in between the  billion and  billion that we started with derek k aberle  president james this is derek on your second question right now were really focused on trying to conclude the remaining agreements through negotiation if thats possible and i think as youve seen and steve mentioned and i mentioned in my comments we have been continuing to conclude additional agreements over time so if we get to the point where we dont believe that thats possible through continued negotiation or the companies arent negotiating in good faith then were certainly prepared to take the next step and enforce our rights with most of the companies it would really be more along the lines of an action to enforce their agreement that they have in place today and like i said weve been preparing for quite some time to do that if necessary but so far have felt like were still making enough progress with the licensees and i think the progress that youre seeing through the announcements is supportive of that and so were going to keep at it and see if we can get across the finish line without the need for litigation but of course thats always an option for us if we need it operator your next question comes from the line of tim long with bmo capital markets please go ahead timothy patrick long  bmo capital markets united states thank you just two if i could steve you mentioned chip margins with regard to thoughts about secondsourcing at large customers could you talk to us just expand a little bit about that on timing when you think you might see secondsource at most of your major customers and on the cost side of it do there need to be opex cuts if there is a second sourcing going on or can you handle it without that and then just one followup for derek on the chinese could you just clarify there have been a lot of announcements from these large players have they pretty much all been just adding threemode to existing deals or have any of those large ones announced been fully incremental or again has it just been just threemode additions thank you steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director tim this is steve so on the secondsourcing i think the main point is that we have been assuming that in our plans really since the beginning of when we did our restructuring difficult for me to talk about timing related to that but i think the point we wanted to communicate was that we are assuming for planning purposes that that is the case and even with that we are comfortable with our margin targets and our improving financials in the chip business in the second half derek k aberle  president tim on your second question i would say weve commented on this a couple of times and unfortunately theres still a little bit of confusion on the catchup picture as weve said most of the companies that weve been negotiating with to try to conclude agreements on the nonthreemode part of the market have been continuing to report and pay under their agreements and so when we sign them to the new ndrc terms that doesnt result in most cases any significant catchup on the nonthreemode part of the market as you noted though in many cases it will result in them starting to pay royalties and pay past royalties on threemode devices that were previously not licensed its turned out so far that a number of the players have been the smaller players in the threemode market and so the contributions from that havent been significant or the way weve structured the deals and how the past royalties have been structured to be paid over time those are things that will come into our pl through probably a period of time later in  and maybe even into  and so we are getting agreements for those to be paid its just that theyre being probably spread over a longer time than people anticipate there are less than a handful of companies that were in negotiations with that are larger players also on threemode and nonthreemode that have been not reporting while theyre negotiating and when we conclude those deals you would expect to see more significant catchup payments for priorperiod sales compared to the ones that weve signed to date operator your next question comes from the line of simona jankowski with goldman sachs please go ahead simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co hi thank you very much can you clarify for the june quarter what is the royalty rate that we should be thinking about i understand that  is the longerterm number but just in the nearer term given the lg and the china catchups how should we think about that for the june quarter derek k aberle  president simona this is derek at this point were not going to guide quarter by quarter on the implied rate as i spent a fair amount of time at the analyst day going through there are so many factors that impact it and the timing of a number of these elements some of which are in our guidance some of which are not in our guidance because we havent yet reached closure on it can have an impact on the rate we do feel continue to feel as i noted in my script that for the year for the full fiscal year that we will be in the range of around the  that i spoke about at the analyst day so still consistent with that but you are going to continue to see fluctuations quarter over quarter as some of these disputes get resolved or catchup payments come in that is going to move so were not going to be guiding one quarter out on that operator our next question comes from the line of mike walkley with canaccord genuity please go ahead t michael walkley  canaccord genuity great thanks switching over to qct to hit your  margin can you walk us through revenue per msm trends is the stepup of plus going to continue to go higher based on mix shift and then also if you could just talk about your momentum in china on the mid to high tier how sustainable you think that is over a multiquarter period and what that might do to the revenue per msm trends longerterm thank you george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey mike its george were seeing a lot of factors that support stronger revenue per msm growth not only in the third quarter but also in the fourth quarter including the lower thin modem youve got very attractive mix shift between the low tier to the mid and the high tier all those things will play strongly in revenue per msm and we expect that to hold in the third and fourth quarters cristiano r amon  evp qualcomm technologies incpresident qualcomm cdma technologies qualcomm inc hey mike this is cristiano i think to your question on china i think if you remember in the last earnings call and during the analyst day i think we talked about an interesting trend in china that was very helpful is the transition of the market to the new version of lte with carrier aggregation and as well as allmode i think were starting to see this strategy materialize not only in this quarter but as we think about the coming quarters and this is driving also the mix improvement on the mid and the high tier we see the mid and high and premium tier in china actually growing faster than the market that helped drive the mix improvement for qct thank you operator your next question comes from the line of rod hall with jpmorgan please go ahead rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc hi guys thanks for taking my question i guess i had two one i wanted go back to this change in the trds unit expectation for the calendar year versus the guidance range for qtl and just understand is the reason that youre not changing the qtl guidance range because these puts and takes youve signed some deals the markets a little bit weaker than you thought you just end up at the same midpoint or can you give us some more color around why those two things seem to differ from each other in terms of movement and then the second thing i wanted to do derek you mentioned in your commentary i think an ecosystem player and expectations for slower upgrade cycle there is most of that expectation happening later this year or are using it happening now can you just clarify whats your definition of ecosystem player is that a vendor or is that a particular region of the world just give us a little bit more clarity there thanks derek k aberle  president rod so let me try to take the first one on so really what were seeing is if we look at the market for calendar  and  came in just slightly lower than what we expected for the year we are seeing some softness in the premium tier some puts and takes some other weakness in emerging regions but actually improvement in china china continues to be quite strong and overall also the asp picture is looking good as well we expected moderation in the asp declines year over year and that seems to be at least so far tracking better than our assumption so we do feel like there is – the netnet of that is a bit weaker market for the fiscal year but we gave a pretty wide range on qtl revenue for the year just given all the different elements in there and we felt with still some time left in the year we do believe we can continue to make progress in china as we have been demonstrating over the last few months and so as george mentioned we just felt it was premature to adjust the range we will need to make more progress relative to where we were before just given the change in the market but we still think the range is a reasonable range to hold for now on the second question really i think what were saying is we are seeing some continued softness in the premium tier we saw that earlier and our projections were based on that its a little bit more softness and i think that plays out it has played out through some of the previous quarters already and will continue through the year operator your next question comes from the line of blayne curtis with barclays please go ahead blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for taking my question just two related questions just when you talked about with the second sourcing that you had a good idea and had rightsized the opex the definition of second source would you have an idea of what percentage youll get and the second part is as you look forward into next year youve always been ahead on the modem but here is a toptier phone using someone elses can you just talk about the sustainability at the leading edge and talk about what percentage of the market actually uses the cat  modem and whether that can increase over time thanks steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director blayne this is steve ill take the first part and maybe cristiano can jump in on the longterm question i think we took an appropriate planning assumption really for sizing the opex we wanted to make sure that when we implemented our realignment in terms of cost structure that we comprehended i think the proper range of outcomes i think we feel quite strong or quite good about our modem roadmap and where its going but i think were doing the appropriate thing from the perspective of planning our opex and maybe cristiano could add some of the product details of that cristiano r amon  evp qualcomm technologies incpresident qualcomm cdma technologies qualcomm inc hi this is cristiano look i think its important to understand when we think about technology not only in the modem space but even on the msm i think we continue to maintain at least two generations lead over the competition but i think more important is some of the transitions and trends were seeing in the market i think one of the things is more the internet is becoming wireless and you see the g transition becoming more mature in developed markets you see carriers now competing for premium customers and the transition that weve been talking about lte to carrier aggregation i think thats actually growing faster so i think youre starting to see gigabit lte modem that we demonstrated and we will see from that one the user from licensing spectrum with the global standard i think was mentioned by steve the laa and maybe within the next two to three years an accelerated timeline of deployment of g as we continue to invest and we see those technology transitions ahead of us we feel very confident that the whole nature of the market is probably going to demand the latest technology and the key devices so thats how were feeling about the market and our modem business thank you operator your next question comes from the line of kulbinder garcha with credit suisse please go ahead kulbinder s garcha  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thanks i just have a couple of questions for derek first of all at the analyst meeting derek you laid out chinese oem revenue of  billion this year and you guys really werent collecting on i think about  of that between what was unlicensed and what was basically underreported just given youve now got  of these deals done and youve got some of the negotiations and youre doing your compliance program and auditing as well should we think about – is the hard work by the end of this fiscal year done that that level that youre not really collecting on today you would have at least addressed through deals and underreporting or is this a program and situation that could roll all the way into  and then for steve and for cristiano maybe on the lte modem probably the last comment you made i take the point by the way that theres carrier aggregation and everything else it looks like you lost market share last year in the chipset industry on the wireless side it probably sounds like theres some risk as we go through this year as well and im just wondering does it take till actually g comes out and carrier aggregation wouldnt really drive home your competitive advantage or could the market share for you at some point start inflecting and you start gaining share in this industry again many thanks derek k aberle  president kulbinder this is derek on your first question i think you got the numbers right the chart that we showed at the analyst day was again for fiscal  basically just in your revenue note catchup from prior periods and we said if we completed these remaining negotiations with the handful of companies we have left that that would get us to about ish collection rate on the trds but that we would continue to have compliance issues that we were going to need to work through and that really is going to be something that we hope to make progress on and expect to make progress on as we move through  but certainly will also be a longerterm project theres a fair amount of work involved and its going to take some time so i think the way to look at it is if we can achieve the results that we hope in the negotiations well have a meaningful step function up on collections but to get to the remainder of that  issue is going to take some time cristiano r amon  evp qualcomm technologies incpresident qualcomm cdma technologies qualcomm inc this is cristiano i think maybe to address your question on share i think it may be important to decompose that question into different segments one if you look on the premium tier we have been – there have been a number of announcements weve been very confident in the snapdragon  i think we made a lot of progress there i think even if you look with one of the large customers both the samsung galaxy s and s edge that launched in the second fiscal quarter theyre using the snapdragon  and i think we have about  designs we feel good about that portfolio and in china if you look at what happened when china entered g – when we started the transition to g we expected over time we started with very high share we expected that to normalize over time but what weve seen actually in this year we are doing better than we expected in share in china and also seeing the impact of those technologies changing the product mix from growth being higher from the low to the mid and high tier showing that modem continues to be a good point of differentiation even in a growth market like in china i think maybe to clarify this i believe we had said early in the year as we went through the srp that we were planning so that we could derisk the market concentration in our planning assumptions i think thats what were saying were planning that we have conservative planning assumptions but at the end of the day were still designing a very competitive product roadmap and were seeing good traction in the marketplace not only on the modem but the msm premium tier and the product portfolio that we have been commercializing in china thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim arcuri with cowen  company please go ahead timothy arcuri  cowen  co llc thanks i had two i guess first of all a question for all of you do you worry that were talking about share loss at the premium tier and theres some consensus as to who youre going to lose that to on the chip side and of course they make their own chips so do you worry that that becomes a competitive disadvantage over time having access to worldclass manufacturing that your foundry partners just frankly arent able to just keep up steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director so tim this is steve i think a couple things one is just to reiterate that for the purpose of when we plan opex and our margin trajectories we do assume that something will happen but were quite confident in our roadmap now right now our products that we are competing against are really not manufactured by – its not a vertical play in terms of who were going after and then specifically when you look at our foundry partners they – were very happy with what were seeing from a transistor roadmap out in time actually from multiple sources so we feel not only can we compete in the modem tier and the connectivity tiers but even more importantly in computing and even computing going into very highperformance computing we have the transistors to be able to make that successful so i think we feel very confident both in the transistor roadmap that were seeing from our suppliers and also with the business model that we will be in a strong position i think also our scale within the fabless industry is actually helping us a lot in terms of pricing i think thats one of the things youre seeing the benefit of in terms of some of the margin improvement that youre seeing embedded in the business in the second half and even delivered out here in the second quarter operator your next question comes from the line of stacy rasgon with bernstein research please go ahead stacy aaron rasgon  bernstein research hi guys thanks for taking my questions i have two the first one on the qtl licensing guide ive got to be honest i still dont understand why youre guiding like youre guiding i understand what youre saying you need to get more collection out but if your trends of collection the range of collection right now was the same today as it was when you first gave the guidance what would the guidance range be what are we talking about here secondly it seems to me like you are implicitly guiding your qtl margins your operating margins into the mid for next quarter which is lower than seasonal and i know you said you had some increase in legal and litigation costs which i assume is whats driving that so are these compliancerelated or is there something else going on the legal and litigation front thats taking the qtl operating margins down next quarter derek k aberle  president stacy this is derek if you look at the q guide i think our view has been that were not going to include in guidance inquarter deals unless we have clear line of sight to those and theyre essentially either done or close to done and so weve been taking a more conservative approach maybe than we have in the past and weve been doing that for a couple of quarters now i think as you see the guide in q is consistent with that and i think really if you step back and look at it the difference may be just the terms of the assumptions and timing if i look at some of the other models out there in terms of what lands in q versus q because of the way were guiding that would essentially mean that more is in q versus q as you look at the profile for the year assuming were able to conclude those remaining deals so that may be part of it on the margin question i just think youre – im not sure how you got to your number thats not consistent with what were modeling in the business george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president i would add that that would be well below our assumption for qtl in any of the remaining quarters and i think what weve seen is on some of these licensing arrangements they can be large and lumpy and trying to forecast what is inherently a negotiation process proved over a number of quarters to be something that either one was hard to do or two created unnecessary negotiating leverage and so i think well stick with this process but we have said for the full year in the  billion to  billion that well have to conclude some activity on the licensing front to get back within that range because of the softness in the market thanks operator your next question comes from the line of tal liani with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead tal liani  merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc hi guys i wanted to understand two things first the contribution of lg this quarter when you guided the quarter i think that lg was not in and im trying to understand how much of the strength this quarter is related the addition of lg versus your previous expectations and how much is the underlying market and then second this is a broader question your qtl is down  year over year and i know there was a catchup payment last year but if i look at – think about things at a high level china was not in last quarter outside of the catchup payment i think from huawei this year this quarter you do have china in you also have lg in so why are we seeing – we dont see much higher contribution of china just on a likeforlike basis again the trds between the two quarters is down  but your revenues are down  so youre down more than the trds that shouldnt happen given that china is kicking in this year so im just trying to understand the dynamics of china contribution and why isnt it at a much stronger pace or a much stronger revenue level than we are seeing right now thanks george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president tal just to be clear the lg settlement happened in our third quarter so it is not in the second quarter numbers it will be roughly  million we said its a couple hundred – roughly  million a quarter for the first two quarters that will be catchup thats embedded in our guidance and then well be back to a run rate with lg but thats all in q really the q item that we talked about was the fact that you had the alu alcatellucent agreement which added approximately  million and then we had seen the discontinuation of a licensing amortization of about  million in that quarter derek did you want to comment on derek k aberle  president yes i think just to add to what george said i think really what we said about lg was its in the quarters weve talked about its been more than  million per quarter so as george said that is not in q that will be reflected in q both the inquarter activity for q as well as two prior quarters of catch up in terms of trying to do the walk between last year q to this year q george hit on some of that obviously weve got a onetime event in q this quarter with the acceleration of the license fee that came in the  millionish payment but then being offset by the fact that lg revenues are deferred theyre not in the quarter and then we also have the end of this  millionish a quarter amortization thats reflected in this quarter plus as you mentioned a year ago we had some catchup payments about  million from the resolution of a prior dispute and then the china contribution china was reflected pretty strongly in a yearago quarter meaning that was the last quarter that was reported to us before the ndrc resolution the effect of that took hold in january of  and so one of the other issues youre dealing with with the yearoveryear comparison is youve got application of the ndrc terms now in this quarter that wasnt a factor a year ago as well as we saw the amount of units that are being underreported accelerate throughout the year last year in particular related to these negotiations where licensees stopped paying and that was not really a primary driver in a yearago quarter so i think thats the walk as probably best we can break it out operator your next question comes from the line of tavis mccourt with raymond james please go ahead tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc hey guys thanks for taking my question a couple of them here first on the msm guidance unit guidance for next quarter so if i look at that on a yearoveryear basis its down high teens and obviously youre gaining some share at a major customer i assume all of that cannot be related to unit weakness at the other major customer and yet everything i hear so far is china is good china is good so help me with that disconnect whats driving that unit growth in light of some share gains at one of your – or unit decline year over year in light of some share gains at one of your larger customers and then secondly to help me get to that  operating margin guidance for june should we expect a more material change in the rd or sga line item as we go from q to q than weve seen earlier this year thanks george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure on the msms as you look at year over year theres definitely a significant delta from one major customer that is contributing and what youre seeing in china is a shift in lowentry to mid and high and so its one of the reasons why youre seeing strong pickup in revenue per msm in the quarter so its a story more of mix shift its pretty neutral outside of that and so the low tier units they tend to be more of those lowtier units that were trading off but were picking up a significant amount of midhigh in terms of opex we expect opex to continue to decrease into the fourth quarter but i think some of the comparisons that you may be doing would be looking at rd period over period but in one period we didnt have the csr opex in the other period we do so just make sure youre doing an applestoapples comparison because weve already seen a fair amount of the reduction already in the base level opex operator your next question comes from the line of david wong with wells fargo please go ahead david m wong  wells fargo securities llc thanks very much a clarification the lg resolution of the dispute did it actually end up in any of the terms of the payments from lg changing and if so are there any adjustments to prior periods that youve already recognized payments from lg derek k aberle  president this is derek no there are not any the deal will not result in any modifications or changes to revenue that was previously recorded by the company and as we said really the results of this will be reflected in q not in q operator your next question comes from the line of cj muse with evercore please go ahead cj muse  evercore isi good afternoon thank you for taking my question i guess two questions first on opex your fiscal year guide implies opex down  in september im curious if thats right and what we should think about going into the december quarter and then secondly with the nice uplift to asps for msm in the june quarter im curious how we should think about that heading into the back half of the calendar year as you layer in both the highend as well as midlevel handsets thank you george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes we said for the full year on opex if you just look at the reported numbers well be down  to  but we have about a  impact from acquisitions so it would be down in the range of  to  year over year and as i said we would continue to expect some cost reduction continuing through the back half of the year just on some of the actions that have taken place in terms of revenue per msm as i said earlier i think the dynamics that are driving the significant pickup that we are seeing in q remain in place for q very good mix strong demand for our premium tier again a shift from low tier into the mid and high tier and then some softness certainly comparatively year over year on thin modem volumes which tend to depress revenues per msm operator your next question comes from the line of edward snyder with charter equity research please go ahead edward f snyder  charter equity research inc thanks steve you said that the forecast for qct margins include expectations for secondsource at your largest customers are we to imply from that statement that the mere mention of it means that it will be material in either units or margins or do you see it more as a headline risk and then along those same lines since we are talking about intel it is true that every modem theyve shipped so far has been fabbed at tsmc but does your calculus on competition or market share change if they move that modem into their own process or does it have no bearing at all on your outlook thanks steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director ed i think on the second question it really doesnt bear much to it the modem business is all about feature leadership and rf and its really about technology breadth and technology complexity it tends to be less about die size and those things and first to market first to market with complexity tends to be the thing that leads the most i think on your first question its really a communication of a planning assumption and also confidence in us meeting our longterm trajectory both in this year and outside of this year with that assumption i think its important to make sure people understand that we do feel very confident though in our position in the modem segment operator your next question comes from the line of kevin cassidy with stifel please go ahead dean grumlose  stifel nicolaus  co inc hello this is dean grumlose calling in for kevin thanks very much for taking my question i have seen numerous announcements of infrastructure and ecosystem progress with armbased server effort can you provide any additional color of your progress in armbased servers at this time and when we might possibly see products or initial revenues derek k aberle  president kevin this is derek we went into some detail on the server opportunity that were pursuing a couple months ago at the analyst day and so we feel very good about the opportunity there not only is it a big and growing opportunity but we feel like were very well positioned to be successful in going after it were looking – we have some development platform out thats in customers hands today and were getting feedback on that and thats going quite well in terms of commercial product basically our assumption is that we will be shipping samples towards the end of the year and revenue would be something that would flow through mid to late next year operator thank you that concludes todays questionandanswer session mr mollenkopf do you have anything to add before adjourning the call steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director yes thank you i want to thank everyone for attending the call today we had a stronger than expected quarter and are executing well on our plans to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth we continued to make good progress on the licensing side in china and this remains a key focus area for the company we are also seeing positive impact of new product releases in qct along with the efficiency gains from our realignment program in closing i want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment as we move forward to capture the many exciting opportunities ahead thank you operator ladies and

results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements and now to comments from qualcomms chief executive officer steve mollenkopf steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director good afternoon and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results which were at the high end of our prior expectations performance was better than expected in qct driven by stronger than expected msm shipments we are pleased with our progress in qct and we are entering  with a strong product roadmap and a clear path to revenue and margin improvement this performance was partially offset by delays in concluding new license agreements in china and share gains by chinese oems that have been underreporting royalties in qtl despite nearterm results the overall qtl business remains strong with a healthy industry backdrop and we are highly focused on taking actions to close the gap between global gg devices sales and total reported device sales before we get to the details i want to take a step back and review our progress in  and key business drivers we faced a number of challenges in fiscal  and weve taken aggressive actions to address these challenges and drive meaningful change to improve performance at the same time we are continuing to drive innovation and growth through investments in our core businesses and emerging growth areas first the ndrc resolution in february was essential milestone removing significant uncertainty and providing a framework for our licensing business in china going forward second we executed a major increase in our capital return program one of the largest in the tech sector reducing our share count by  year over year third we remained focused on addressing areas within our control including making sure we have the right cost structure for the future a corporate structure that maximizes value and will position us for the strategic opportunities ahead within a dynamic industry landscape the appropriate capital structure and level of dividends and share repurchases the optimal board composition and management incentives and a capital allocation plan that ensures that our investment dollars are spent in areas with the most promising risk adjusted returns we are on track with the strategic realignment plan announced in july and we are making excellent progress on each of the initiatives in the fourth quarter we made significant progress in implementing our  billion cost reduction plan we took action to decrease spend in qct and reduce investments outside of qct and qtl with the recently closed sale of vuforia and significant reductions in areas such as display we are on track with a review of financial and structural alternatives and continue to expect to complete the review by the end of the calendar year our two new board members have already made valuable contributions and we are in the process of adding another new member to the board we have also implemented changes to our executive compensation plans that further align our compensation with performance in fiscal year  we remained extremely focused on driving our position in key adjacent areas in august we completed the acquisition of csr which we expect to drive meaningful growth for qct in key adjacencies such as automotive and ioe finally qualcomms innovation pipeline remains strong our technology and product roadmap continues to lead the industry and we are investing to drive the next wave of growth in mobile as well as in other opportunities we are excited about our latest products including the snapdragon  and expect momentum for these products to build through fiscal  and into  before turning to the business i want to comment on the change weve made to our approach to guidance going forward we will provide quarterly financial guidance as weve always done but adjust our approach to annual guidance we will continue to provide certain industry and financial metrics but we will no longer provide guidance on total company annual revenue and earnings per share to help you with this transition we will continue to provide certain fiscal year information for  which george will detail shortly this change aligns our guidance practices more closely with our semiconductor and largecap tech peers to be clear were not changing any of our longterm guidance metrics provided prior to this call specifically our plus operating margin target for qct our  to  operating margin target for qtl or our ongoing capital return commitments we also continue to target a qct operating margin of at least  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in qtl our path to growth is driven by continued strong unit growth in emerging regions the replacement trends in developed regions that we have previously explained and the adoption of gg cellular connectivity in adjacent segments in china we have been working hard to implement the ndrc licensing terms and improve compliance while we have made progress with these negotiations and concluded new agreements recently with two major chinese oems progress has been slower than we had originally anticipated the timing of concluding new agreements and progress with compliance is inherently difficult to predict but we fully expect to successfully conclude new agreements and improve compliance over time in the nearterm these factors will continue to impact our ability to grow the licensing business in line with global gg device sales however as we work through the compliance and licensing matters we expect our growth rate to converge with the rate of global gg device sales growth depending on the amount of catchup reporting we could exceed global gg device sales growth for a period of time qtl remains a source of significant strength for qualcomm and we are confident in our longterm qtl business outlook based on continued growth of gg across mobile devices and new product categories as well as our continued innovation in new mobile technologies let me now turn to qct fiscal  will be a transition year for this business and we expect our performance in the second half of the year to be much stronger than in the first half which will continue to be affected by the factors that impacted  our performance improvement will be driven by our strong lineup of new chipsets across tiers benefits from our cost reduction efforts operational improvements and reduced product costs as we transition to the  nanometer node specifically at the premium tier we are seeing strong customer interest in snapdragon  among leading oems with more than  designs overall we have launched our fifthgeneration snapdragon x lte modem which offers industry leading throughput and power efficiency with support for all modes and the latest cat  downlink and cat  uplink capabilities we have confidence in customer traction and expect it to be a significant product for us in the second half of the fiscal year in addition we are upgrading our mid and low tier roadmaps we recently announced our new snapdragon  and  processors which have added support for carrier aggregation with x and x lte modems respectively and new support for dual cameras we are also continuing to expand in adjacent areas where we can build off our differentiated skill set and core ip roadmap in smartphones to create new revenue opportunities to highlight just a few examples in the networking space we launched a wave  ac wifi systemonachip for routers gateways and access points we also expanded our portfolio for smart carrier home gateways following our acquisition of ikanos communications in the iot space we launched a reference design for ip cameras new lte cat  and catm modems for connected devices and the snapdragon flight reference design for consumer drones the ioe applications for qualcomm technologies are vast and i believe we are just at the beginning we also continue to advance our position in the compute space with three tiers of snapdragon lte modems for windows  notebooks ins and tablets further csr expands our distribution channels and strengthens our position by accelerating our time to market in the key ioe and automotive segments revenues from our adjacent business areas automotive mobile compute ioe and networking delivered approximately  of qct revenues in fiscal  and we expect this to grow significantly in  with the addition of a full year of csr revenues as well as through organic growth we expect our momentum in qct to continue into fiscal  and beyond as we did in both g and g we are investing to lead the industry in the development of g technologies such as a unified air interface with optimized ofdmbased waveforms g will offer native support to unlicensed spectrum and enhanced mobile broadband performance and enable connectivity for the internet of everything as well as new types of services that require lower latency and higher reliability and security our focus on g along with leadership in lte advanced and wifi including wifi ad in  gigahertz allows us to offer integrated modem solutions that leverage licensed and unlicensed bands we are enabling mobile operators and new wireless players such as cable companies to deploy a multitude of new services to their subscribers weve announced lteu chipset support for small cells and mobile devices and operators in the us including verizon att and tmobile are commencing trials as early as this year with some of them planning for initial commercial deployments in  we are well positioned to address this increasing complexity of wireless networks and bands by offering integrated solutions at scale and enabling rapid worldwide deployment capability to our partners we are confident in our leading technology and multiyear roadmap and we are focused on improving the efficiency of our operations and taking advantage of the significant opportunities for growth available to us we believe our business initiatives will enable qualcomm to drive value and growth momentum so that we exit fiscal  on an improving financial trajectory with that i will turn the call over to derek derek k aberle  president thank you steve and good afternoon everyone fiscal  was a record year for qtl with total reported device sales revenues and earnings before tax all reaching record levels we concluded the ndrc investigation and resolved a dispute with a major chinese licensee we launched a significant effort to implement the terms of the ndrc resolution in china including signing licenses for mode devices and to improve compliance by our licensees looking ahead the outlook for global gg device sales continues to be strong we expect low single digit percentage growth in global gg device sales in fiscal  however longerterm we expect stronger global gg device sales growth as unit growth continues to stay strong and annual asp declines further moderate over time we estimate that global gg device shipments will grow approximately  in calendar  and  in calendar  at the midpoint driven primarily by the migration to gg devices in emerging regions and cellular connectivity growth in adjacent segments outside of handsets we expect global gg device asps to decline at a more moderate rate in fiscal  versus fiscal  although still at a higher rate than we expect over the longer term this outlook reflects a number of factors including heavier than normal discounting of high premium tier devices in the near term and continued share gains by chinese oems that are currently selling at lower prices than other licensees over the longer term we expect asp declines to moderate for a variety of reasons including oem consolidation in china and increasing device asps by chinese oems as well as users in emerging regions replacing devices at higher price points we are continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreement with chinese oems on the ndrc terms and improve compliance with chinese licensees to date we have offered the ndrc license terms for our current g and g essential chinese patents to our licensees and to a number of unlicensed oems and manufacturers we are continuing to make progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new agreements with two major chinese oems zte and tcl on terms consistent with the ndrc terms this brings the total number of new china patent license agreements we have signed to over  importantly these agreements also include royalty bearing licenses for mode devices while we continue to make progress in our continued interactions with the ndrc and other parts of the chinese government give us confidence that we will be able to conclude agreements with all of the important oems the negotiations with a handful of these licensees are taking longer than we previously expected in some of these cases although the licensees acknowledged they need to pay royalties to qualcomm we believe in connection with the negotiations they have stopped reporting certain of their sales and royalties or did not report their sales and royalties in a manner that allows us to record revenue similar to the dispute we resolved during fiscal  with a major chinese oem that resulted in a catchup payment for prior period amounts we expect these licensees will report and pay the royalties they are improperly withholding once we conclude new license agreements with them while we continue to work to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through commercial negotiations and audits we are actively preparing to enforce our agreements andor take other actions against oems that are not negotiating in good faith underreporting royalties or refusing to conclude agreements within a reasonable period of time we have a number of tools at our disposable that can be deployed both within and outside of china that we believe will ultimately resolve this activity for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the global gg device sales were in line with our expectations but total reported device sales for the quarter came in below the low end of our guidance range primarily as a result of the chinese licensees i just mentioned refusing to report royalties slower than previously expected progress on signing license agreements covering mode devices and chinese oems that are either unlicensed or underreporting royalties growing at a faster rate than the overall market and thereby gaining share these factors resulted in approximately  million less in qtl revenue for the fourth quarter as compared to our prior expectations and lower than expected qtl operating margin we expect qtl operating margin be flat to down quarter over quarter in the first quarter of fiscal  but then improve with revenue growth throughout the rest of the year we expect the factors that impacted our fiscal  fourth quarter results will continue to impact the licensing business until we conclude additional license agreements with the remaining major chinese oems and improve reporting compliance the timing of which is difficult to predict despite our expectation for continued progress given this inherent uncertainty we are taking a cautious approach to our qtl guidance under this scenario total reported device sales for the first quarter of fiscal  are expected to be in the range of  billion to  billion and fiscal year  qtl revenue is expected to be in the range of  billion to  billion the key drivers between the low and the high end of the fiscal  range are the timing of concluding new license agreements with the remaining major chinese oems and the pace at which our efforts to improve compliance deliver results the  billion low end of the range assumes a meaningful year over year increase in the number of unreported device by chinese oems little to no progress on signing new license agreements or amendments with chinese oems and no significant catchup amounts related to prior periods or audit recoveries the  billion high end of the range assumes meaningful progress in a number of these areas but does not reflect the reporting of royalties on the full fiscal  global gg device sales or the receipt of catchup amounts for all prior period sales it is also important to understand that we expect qtl fiscal  revenue growth will be impacted by the full year effect of applying the ndrc terms for sales in china as compared to only a partial year in  and expected yearoveryear increase in reported mix to more mode sales as the year progresses and a full year effect of fx headwinds we are not satisfied with the gap that exists between the global gg device sales and total reported device sales and we are highly focused on taking actions to close that gap and collect catchup payments from prior period underreporting as quickly as possible we continue to expect qtl revenue to track global gg device sales growth over the longer term and catchup payments to provide additional growth as we work through these issues we expect roughly similar seasonality in fiscal  as in prior years with december shipments driving a stronger fiscal second quarter for qtl depending on the pace of progress in china the implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide is expected to be down modestly in fiscal  as compared to where we exited fiscal  based primarily on an increase in devices being reported under the ndrc terms including mode devices in conclusion we continue to see favorable longterm market trends for our licensing business and remain confident that we will be able to conclude new agreements with the remaining chinese oems and improve compliance over time that concludes my comments i will now turn the call over to george george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you derek and good afternoon everyone i will begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter results update you on our cost reduction initiatives provide our first quarter guidance and then discuss some key metrics for fiscal  in our fiscal fourth quarter we delivered revenues of  billion and nongaap earnings per share of  in qtl total reported device sales by our licensees were  billion below the low end of our guidance range for the reasons derek described qct had a stronger than expected quarter with revenues of  billion and an operating margin of  while industry trends in the quarter were mostly in line with our july expectations we also saw incremental demand strength for low tier devices particularly at a large customer revenue per msm continued to reflect the mix shift toward modemonly products at a large oem in the premium tier we closed the csr acquisition in august which contributed approximately  million in revenue in the quarter and was marginally accretive to our nongaap results nongaap combined rd and sga expenses were down  sequentially on cost controls and spending reductions under our strategic realignment plan during the fiscal fourth quarter we returned  billion to stockholders including approximately  million of dividends paid and  billion in share repurchases we also completed our  billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last may additionally since the end of the fiscal fourth quarter we have repurchased an additional  million shares for approximately  billion during fiscal  we returned over  of free cash flow to our stockholders on share repurchases of  billion and dividends of  billion which included the  dividend increase we announced in march these actions represent significant progress on our srp commitment to reaffirm our ongoing return of  of free cash flow in dividends and share repurchases in addition to our commitment of an incremental  billion in share repurchases by march of  we are on track to achieve the  billion of spending reductions related to the srp as a reminder the  billion number includes a  million reduction in annual employee stock grants and a  billion or approximately  reduction in nongaap combined rd and sga and engineering spend in cost of goods sold this plan excludes the impact of acquisitions we continue to expect fiscal  results to benefit from  million of these cost reductions which represents approximately  of the srp spending baseline fiscal  spending came in approximately  million below the srp baseline this includes approximately  million of srp cost reductions as well as lower than baseline variable compensation which combined impacts the yearoveryear comparison by approximately  relative to the baseline including recent acquisitions of which csr is the largest we expect nongaap combined rd and sga expense will be down approximately  to  year over year without the acquisitions we would be lower by approximately  to  year over year our ir website provides an updated overview of the srp spending reductions including the impact of acquisitions during our fiscal fourth quarter severance and others costs related to the plan were  million and were excluded from nongaap earnings we continue to expect the range of charges to be  million to  million and as previously discussed our cost actions ramp throughout fiscal  and are more heavily weighted to the back half of the fiscal year lets now turn to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal  we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately  billion to  billion up approximately  sequentially at the midpoint we estimate nongaap earnings per share in our first fiscal quarter to be approximately  to  per share down  sequentially at the midpoint we anticipate fiscal first quarter nongaap combined rd and sga expenses will be up  to  sequentially reflecting a full quarter of csr in our results and increased variable compensation accruals partially offset by the early stage benefits of the srp cost reduction program for the reasons derek explained were taking a more cautious approach in providing our qtl guidance for the fiscal first quarter in qtl we expect total reported device sales for the fiscal first quarter reflecting reports of our licensees for shipments they made in the september quarter to be in the range of  billion to  billion down approximately  sequentially at the midpoint driven by the china impacts that derek described as well as a sequential decline in the asp but to a lesser degree than the decline we experienced in the same quarter last year in qct for our fiscal first quarter we expect msm shipments will be in the range of approximately  million to  million units up approximately  sequentially at the midpoint reflecting the seasonally strong fourth calendar quarter and our view of a more normalized inventory environment we expect healthy demand growth for our modems and high and mid tier chipsets providing support for qct operating margins to be at  or slightly better with respect to our annual guidance were providing our outlook for global gg adoption trends including calendar year gg unit shipments and fiscal year global gg device sales we are also providing fiscal year guidance on operating expenses combined interest expense and investment income and tax rate we expect the industry trends we saw develop in the second half of fiscal  particularly in the premium tier to continue to impact qct in the first half of fiscal  consistent with prior years we expect qcts fiscal second quarter to be down sequentially with operating margins in the low to mid single digits driven primarily by seasonally lower msm shipments annual pricing resets and increased costs tied to the ramp of new products we expect improving product mix from new chipset introductions particularly in the second half of fiscal  resulting in improved revenue per msm combined with the benefits of our cost savings over time this mix shift underpins the improvement we see in qcts profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter we continue to expect qct to improve to at least a  operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter of  in qtl as derek commented our guidance reflects the timing uncertainty in china inherent in signing new licensing agreements and resolving compliance issues this scenario implies a range of qtl revenue from  billion at the low end of the range to  billion approximately flat year over year at the high end of the range with progress on signing new licensing agreements and other compliance measures the key drivers of that range combined interest expense and investment income is expected to be lower by approximately  million year over year with about half from interest expense related to higher average debt balances and the other half reflecting lower expected realized gains on financial market conditions as well as lower investment balances due to our expanded return of capital initiatives we estimate our nongaap fiscal  tax rate to be approximately  to  that will conclude my comments and i will now turn the call back to warren warren kneeshaw  vice presidentinvestor relations thank you george operator we are ready for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you your first question comes from the line of simona jankowski with goldman sachs please go ahead simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co hi thank you very much i just wanted to clarify a little bit more what is causing the hold up in the collections within qtl especially considering that the couple of large licensees you cited are taking the ndrc terms rather than your traditional more flexible terms so it would seem like thats little bit more cut and dry and then as far as what youre assuming in the guidance for qtl for the first fiscal quarter it sounded like youre not really assuming any recovery of the prior royalties even though youve just signed a couple of the licensees zte and tcl so i just wanted to clarify if the catch up for those two is included or why wouldnt you be seeing some improvement just from those two alone derek k aberle  president hi simona this is derek yes really in china i think its much of the same story that has been playing out through the year we are making progress as you said we signed both zte and tcl this quarter which i think is good continued traction on significant oems now thats added to the list with huawei that have accepted the ndrc terms but there are a handful of still significant chinese oems that were continuing to negotiate with and as we noted before these things are difficult to predict from a timing standpoint and so were going to continue to work through that and as we do we expect that the picture will improve moving forward i would say the thing thats a little bit new this time is as the negotiations have progressed you have discussions around mode licensing where the companies were unlicensed in the past and therefore not paying while the negotiation progresses but in most other cases licensees have continued to report and pay on their non mode devices such as wcdma devices and that is a little bit different this quarter in the sense that a handful or less than a handful of these companies have actually we think as a negotiating tactic stopped reporting and paying similar to what we went through last year when we were dealing with the other dispute with the chinese oem which ultimately got resolved as you may recall with a catchup payment coming in so again our feeling is that in the end we will get these agreements concluded and when that happens these payments will come in but we are taking a cautious approach to the guidance for q as well as the full fiscal year in qtl just because the timing of these things is uncertain on zte and tcl in particular those companies were reporting royalties while we were negotiating those deals so even though we signed there will not be significant catchup payments coming through although there will be some royalties coming in on mode those players are not the largest players in the mode space in china operator your next question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley please go ahead and james please make sure that your lines not on mute james e faucette  morgan stanley  co llc sorry it was on mute so i just want to ask a clarifying question there derek on huawei zte and tcl it sounds like then whatever catchups – or should we assume that all the catchups from those players are either quite small or already built into the reported numbers in the december quarter guide and then i wanted to ask quickly about chipset shipments what drove the upside to your estimates in the december quarter it seemed like coming out of the june quarter that you were concerned about overall channel inventory and you seemed to imply that came down in spite of the much stronger shipments so im just wondering where the upside came from and then finally george in the september quarter results and the december quarter outlook how much of a contribution are you getting from csr for those two periods thanks derek k aberle  president this is derek on the first one actually huawei was signed earlier in the year didnt come through this quarter and as to tcl and zte there will be some catchup payments that come through december but theyre relatively small in comparison so you should think about the cautious q guidance as really not reflecting resolution of these pending negotiated agreements or any catchups that would flow through there steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director james this is steve with respect to the chipset shipments in q what happened was really there was a broadbased improvement in share relative to expectations in that quarter in particular at a large customer our mid and low tier shipments were stronger than we expected so i think were exiting the fiscal year a bit stronger than we would have said we were going to exit in july so were pleased with that george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president james this is george on csr contribution it was  million in revenue in the quarter it was very modestly accretive so if you back that out you can see that we were above the midpoints of our guidance without consideration of csr operator your next question comes from the line of tim long with bmo capital markets please go ahead tim long  bmo capital markets united states thank you maybe just give china a break over to the chips again two things on the margins here first could you just talk a little bit – it looks to us like the gross margin did improve in the quarter was that just a mix thing or are we starting to see either better pricing discipline or some of the benefits of the restructuring program taking effect and could we expect that to continue and then related to it talking about  million in opex coming on from the acquisitions seems a bit large is that a number that will be subject to the similar type of analysis about a restructuring program that the rest of the qct business went through so in other words is there opportunity to move that number lower being combined with the broader qualcomm thanks george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey tim its george on gross margin i would say it was more a function of mix that you were seeing in the quarter and if i look at acquisitions that includes i should point out since we were talking about it in the context of the baseline for the strategic realignment plan that that was includes the engineering spend within cost of goods sold as well so now again the majority is opex we will have synergy plans and we do have synergy plans for both of the acquisitions that are included in that and again csr being the largest were going to talk about our view on these acquisitions and the synergy plans as part of the analyst meeting which we expect to be in the first quarter and well give you little more color there so we will execute on the synergy plans but it is not part of the strategic realignment plan operator your next question comes from the line of mike walkley with canaccord genuity please go ahead t michael walkley  canaccord genuity inc great thanks derek just going back to the units can you ballpark for us how many units you think you werent paid for in fiscal  and where you think that gap can close to has it been as much as  of units underreported in the last one or two quarters derek k aberle  president mike without really getting into the units because i dont think we have broken that out if you actually look at the metrics we did give we gave you a global gg device sales number for the fiscal  year and the midpoint of that is about  billionish and if you look at where we rolled up for the reported trds at about  billionish you can see that the gap theres a little more than  billion of trds for fiscal  that probably was a little more back half weighted versus front half weighted but the delta is more in the range of approximately  operator your next question comes from the line of blayne curtis with barclays please go ahead blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for taking my question i just want to understand it seems like asp for msm is down obviously more thin modems may contribute to that in the december quarter and then as you look into next year if you just comment on the progress of the  you said customer acceptance there has obviously been some talk again about issues with that you would think that would have a positive impact for your msm asps when would you expect to get a more material contribution from that product george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi blayne its george ill just give you the quick overview we do think revenue per msm improves throughout the year on mix it is driven by our view of the premium tier improving in the second half and first part of the year we see much more of a weighting of the impact on the modem on the business driving the mix effects in the first part of the year steve steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director on the  its looking great and the customer feedback is quite strong on it its going to be something that contributes in the second half of the year its certainly not going to be in the first quarter necessarily but we have high hopes for that product and you heard me say that customer traction is quite strong its over  designs i think its going to be a good product for us operator your next question comes from the line of rod hall with jpmorgan please go ahead rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc yeah hi guys thanks for the question i just wanted to ask about the qtl margins they were depressed in the september quarter and then the guidance on our math anyway seems to suggest that theyre at least flat and probably down in the fiscal q i wonder first of all if we got that right on the qtl margins and then could you comment on what those margins are likely to do next year are they likely to stay at these same depressed levels or do you think they bounce back as you recover more of the unreported revenue just kind of give us some idea for what the trajectory of that looks like thanks derek k aberle  president rod this is derek yes i think you got it right its really largely a revenue driven story theres a little bit of the opex that rolls through in the current quarter that we wouldnt expect to see again in next quarter but you know its really a revenue story so as the year progresses and we make progress we do believe the margins will be stronger kind of as we move forward through the year operator your next question comes from the line of kulbinder garcha with credit suisse please go ahead kulbinder s garcha  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thanks a question for derek just on the qtl business as i look at it from a fiscal year perspective youre basically implying its going to shrink the overall tam is expanding which you talked about and then ive got to assume that in fiscal year  versus  youre having more of the underreported units that were there paying you so it should kind of grow i think so is it because the people that are underreporting last year are gaining so much share that thats having a negative impact on the qtl revenue line is that one of the drivers im missing or is something happening to the actual royalty rate going down for some sort of mix can you just comment on is there something wrong with that high level way of thinking about fiscal year  from fiscal year  numbers on the qtl side or is there any other facts i should think about thanks derek k aberle  president kulbinder this is derek yeah let me try to break it down so if you think about the end market the global trds we expect will grow kind of low single digit over fiscal  so there will be some growth there but not as strong as we saw last year we think that that actually picks up over time as the asp declines further moderate and we continue to see good unit growth but in  in particular the growth is somewhat muted on top of that you do have some headwinds facing the business and i mentioned them in my remarks one is that in  we had a partial year effect of the chinese companies that accepted the new ndrc terms reporting under those terms as opposed to the old ones which were higher in  we would have a full year impact of that in addition we had some fx headwinds in fiscal  that were really a partial year effect that we expect will actually be a full year effect in  and finally we expect within the china market a higher mix of mode devices which under the ndrc terms come through at a lower revenue per unit is one way to think about it so when you roll all that up just from a nonstructural standpoint that gives you a growth picture for the business on top of that there is obviously an impact from the negotiation process where these handful of licensees that were in negotiations with stopped reporting and weve rolled a cautious approach to that through our guidance and as we make progress on those negotiations we expect that to improve so if everything came together and we were able to get the remaining agreements done and resolve some of the other compliance issues and recover the catchups we would come in above the high end of our range its just thats a lot to promise within fiscal  so we havent built all of that upside into the guidance range operator your next question comes from the line of stacy rasgon with bernstein research please go ahead stacy a rasgon  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi guys thanks for taking my questions i got to say im a little confused i was hoping you can clear this up for me so it seems like youve been holding your outlook for the global market flat to even up over the last few quarters and yet youve been stepping what youre capturing down which implies to me that your ability to get paid in china has been getting even worse and worse after you signed the ndrc settlement which to me just doesnt make a lot of sense why would your ability to get paid get worse after you settled with the government how do you know youre not just underestimating the market growth itself rather than your ability to get paid in that market like how can we get comfort around that derek k aberle  president stacy this is derek so listen we have a view on the market we think that thats a pretty well informed view and it is modest growth year over year  to  i think what youre seeing in china is a picture play out that was not all that unexpected meaning once the resolution happened with china we had to go through the process of implementing the agreedupon terms with our licensees and we knew that that process would take some time we have made a lot of progress on that as i mentioned weve got a number of agreement signed up but there are still a handful of significant ones that are under negotiation so whats played out through the course of this year really are a few different things one is we have made slower than expected progress in these negotiations which means that were not getting paid on as large amount of the mode volume that we expected and thats really a negotiating dynamic from our perspective once we get these agreements done we will get paid the second is as i mentioned more recently the handful of negotiations that we are involved in weve had some of the licensees take probably a little more aggressive negotiating stance and start withholding payments while were negotiating we do have confidence they acknowledge that they owe the royalties and that we will get paid on these once the agreements are concluded but the timing of thats uncertain and so were being cautious about the guidance on that finally if you look at the share of the chinese oems worldwide the chinese oems have continued to gain share throughout  and we believe that will be the case in fiscal  as well and so you essentially have a piece of the market that has very high compliance losing share to another part of the market that has some compliance challenges and the issues that i just mentioned so thats really whats driving the gap between the end market and whats getting reported to us and we believe we have a wellthoughtout aggressive plan for how to deal with that its just a question of when that will all get resolved operator your next question comes from the line of tavis mccourt with raymond james please go ahead tavis c mccourt  analyst raymond james  associates inc hey thanks for taking my question got a couple first for george if you could outline the onshore cash position at the end of the year and then two for you steve in terms of the snapdragon  obviously  design wins sounds impressive but equally obviously theres a handful that really matter right so im trying to figure out based on your full year guidance of improving trend how much of that is still business to be won versus business thats in hand design wins on the high volume projects and then also if you could talk a little bit about g you mentioned ofdma in terms of a near  interface is there debate about that at this point or are pretty much all sides of the industry firmly aligned with ofdma at this point thanks george s davis  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi this is george in terms of onshore and offshore we ended the year with  billion in cash  billion of which was onshore steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director on the  this is steve on the  i feel like weve got broadbased design wins there and we feel good about it its certainly a component of the improving trend that we think is going to play out in  in qct there are also a number of other products that we have upgraded that will also contribute to that but on the product side we feel good about that product as i said and i think that will be a good story as we roll through the year if we continue to execute in terms of the timing of these products as you know it continues to move throughout the year so from everything that we see so far were pleased with how we see it on g a couple things on g first when we look at g we look at that as an area where it will be a continuation of – we think the strength that weve had in g will also transition over to g one of the reasons is that the anchor bands or the anchor g actually uses a g anchor i think theres pretty well – a pretty good alignment at the physical layer on how we put things together we are obviously contributing a lot on g g compared to maybe g and g there are probably fewer companies really carrying the load there were certainly one of them and then upstream of that will be we think a number of products that deliver on g and wifi together and so from the modem perspective i think its going to roll out and be a pretty good dynamic moving forward it will be more complex but we think complexity is something that were equipped to handle and handle at scale for the industry operator your next question comes from the line of mark sue with rbc capital markets please go ahead mark sue  rbc capital markets llc thank you on qct if i consider your qualitative comments today the worst seems to be over and next year will show a return to growth the renewed optimism aside from the product competitiveness and the diversification do you feel that you are winning back a lot of the oems and also in terms of quantifying iot is there an opportunity to take a leadership pole position in iot considering the rapid growth that we should see in this segment over the next few years steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director mark yeah i would agree with your characterization i think this year was a real transition year for the structure of the qct business we had to change two things one is we changed our cost structure were obviously executing on that and we will be throughout the fiscal year the other one is that weve restructured the way in which we are organized to enable us to go after new markets yet still leverage the same ip roadmap that we build and continued to develop to service smartphones and mobile and in particular in the area of ioe and such its really become an interesting story i mean we have created products that from an engineering perspective feel like derivative products but now they are products that enable us to take our modem leadership and to deliver it into new markets i talked about a couple of our modem upgrades where we take products we focus them on some of the machinetomachine applications that exist in the gpp standard and it really opens up our ability now to sell products into things like chinese white good manufacturers or into automobiles and machinetomachine products so i think theres a good pipeline and a good fanout for our ip roadmap and well start to deliver that more and more as we go through fiscal year  and it will be one of the reasons why we think well be on an improving trajectory as we exit the fiscal year mark sue  rbc capital markets llc okay operator next question comes from the line of alex gauna with jmp securities please go ahead alex d gauna  jmp securities llc thanks very much for taking my question steve just to return to that topic we were just on even though i think the  probably gives you a great chance to recapture some share in the market the trend seems to be towards the lower end now and where the high end does exist it seems to be captured or dominated largely by the iphone right now where you dont have the apps processor attached what is the risk that when we do move into the back half of the year this same dynamic exists and challenges your ability to show those improvements youre looking forward to steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director well i think a couple of things alex one is that we do participate in i think a broader crosssection of the market than just the high tier snapdragon products and thats obviously something thats helped us in q right now and weve also taken our cost structure and made fundamental changes to it really to desensitize the business to some of the concentration impacts that youve seen in fiscal year  taken a lot of work from the team to do that i think that will isolate or at least insulate us a bit from those things in the future that being said ill tell you im looking at whats happening in the industry and the share shifts and the designin momentum and its probably a little bit more optimistic a view from our view looking at the customer space than some of the narratives that youll hear about the products i mean weve upgraded the product line from top to bottom here in the last six months and were very pleased with how were getting traction and i hope the market will support that as the products move forward and weve got the things that we can control hopefully in the right spot as well were clearly executing on those things and were going to keep people up to date as to how were doing operator your next question comes from the line of george iwanyc with oppenheimer please go ahead george m iwanyc  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you for taking my question steve following up on those line of questions how do you feel about your relationship with samsung right now and how broadly are you exposed to their product mix steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director well i think we have a very good relationship with samsung i think also the relationship with samsung is much broader than perhaps people ask us about we are a strong foundry partner and foundry customer of theirs we obviously have an ip arrangement as well as a product arrangement we also have partnerships with products that we put on our reference design so its a very broad relationship and the way i would characterize it is that its getting stronger versus moving the other direction so its good to have the scale and the breadth of products that we have i think it gives us probably a little bit more to bring to the table when we talk to large multinational companies operator your next question comes from the line of vijay rakesh with mizuho please go ahead vijay r rakesh  mizuho securities usa inc hey guys thanks just on the handset asps i was wondering since you talked about china being a drag longer term where do you see handsets asps exiting fiscal  and fiscal  thanks derek k aberle  president this is derek yeah so i think what youre seeing is the trends that weve talked about for some time playing out broadly in line with what we expected meaning we did expect asps to moderate over time and if you look at what were projecting to happen in fiscal  as compared to  we do expect further declines but probably at about half the rate that we saw in  and over time we expect that that will moderate further for a lot of the reasons weve already explained including the fact that there will be further concentration we think within the chinese oem base and we are continuing to see evidence that the chinese oems asps are increasing over time to come closer in line with some of the nonchinese suppliers and thats a trend that we think will continue going forward and then importantly as we see more of the growth in the future coming from the emerging regions were going to get to a place probably starting next year where theres more of a replacement market in the emerging regions as opposed to the first migration from g to gg and that will have a moderating effect on asp declines over time so again i think like i said broadly in line with what weve been expecting and well definitely be updating this picture when we do our analyst day early in the next calendar year operator your next question comes from the line of edward snyder with charter equity please go ahead edward f snyder  charter equity research inc thank you very much in terms of the competitive environment in a  as it stands now i know that there were some struggles with the asp erosion in this period and it sounds like youre going to continue that maybe the next too what is  i know youve got a new product roadmap coming out here but if you look at both the emerging market products coming out of mediatek and intel and the internal solutions which seem to be spreading at least to their own oems and samsung huawei and xiaomi how does that change next year do these oems continue to use these products and will they propagate out and will g help you at all since most of that is probably rf driven more so than basebands im just trying to get an arm around how the dynamic thats causing some of the problems in qct changes in the next year or so thanks steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director ed this is steve i think the competitive dynamic its still a very competitive market particularly at the low tier we consider ourselves to be in a very strong position there i feel good about our competitive position at the higher tiers and particularly in the areas where people want to have international launches i think our position it feels quite comfortable that being said there are a lot of people going after this market its an attractive market but i think its getting harder and harder for people to have the breadth of technology to deliver on all of these products but you know the competitive marketplace its still a lot of people that want to enter into it but we feel good about our competitive position operator your next question comes from the line of srini pajjuri with clsa securities please go ahead srini r pajjuri  clsa americas llc thank you steve i had a question on your modem business im just curious as to how much visibility do you have into your design wins and based on what you see out there how you feel about your market share in the high tier modem segment steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director yeah on the modem side its obviously a strength of qualcomms we tend to be several if not multiple generations ahead of our competitors primarily on feature set but also on maturity geographical breadth and those are important things when youre talking about dealing particularly with worldwide oems and its an area that we obviously defend very rigorously the other aspect thats happening and will play out over the next couple of years is that the importance of having rf the access to multiple bands the ability to deliver products not only in the licensed bands but in the unlicensed bands will continue to become actually will increasingly become more important and those things will be table stakes by the time you get to g now were driving to have those things happen as quickly as we can in terms of visibility into design wins i think probably the most important thing is we have visibility into the competitive positions of where we sit relative maybe to some of the competitive or the competing chipsets and i think we feel good about those positions that being said we do try to manage our business to never take those things for granted and keep driving it forward and hopefully youre hearing that tone from us on the call today were continuing to invest in what we think are the things that drive benefit to the business and this is certainly one of them operator this ends our allotted time for questions and answers mr mollenkopf do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call steven m mollenkopf  chief executive officer  director thank you yeah i just want thank our employees really for delivering a strong quarter in a period of difficult decisions and realigning the company for the future so this year  will be an important transition year for us were focusing on a great set of products were clearly focused strongly on improving our licensing compliance as derek said and then were executing on the strategic realignment plan so i just want to thank the employees for all their hard work and its an important year for us and im optimistic about it and i just want to thank
