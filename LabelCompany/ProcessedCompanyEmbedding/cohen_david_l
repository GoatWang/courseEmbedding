comcasttime warner cable merger he also led the effort to win fcc support for comcast’s acquisition of nbc universal at center is arthur minson chief financial officer for time warner cable credit jonathan ernstreuters one morning late last month david l cohen took a seat in a conference room atop comcast’s corporate headquarters in philadelphia the tallest building in the city and was handed a binder of architectural drawings the plans were for a second comcast skyscraper taller than the first because the growing company needs more spacemr cohen  comcast’s executive vice president studied the drawings and directed a series of questions toward a video screen that connected him to a representative of the developer and a comcast executive in new york on what floor should the cafeteria go how many cars could be parked in a small underground garage and had anyone done a traffic study of the narrow city street where the garage would exit since the new building is intended for engineers and other hightech workers would the ratio of square footage per employee be similar to that of the comcast facility in silicon valleymr cohen is well known in philadelphia from his time as chief of staff to former mayor edward g rendell in the s a sixyear tenure that established his reputation as a master of bigpicture strategy fine detail and just about everything in between“whatever the issue is david learns more about it than anyone and he can keep it all in his head” mr rendell says “with me he knew all about municipal pensions and he knew about picking up trash — i mean the actual routes of the garbage trucks” advertisement continue reading the main story at comcast mr cohen has extended his range of competencies by transforming himself into a supremely wellconnected political player president obama at mr cohen’s home in philadelphia in  to raise money for democratic senate candidates joked “i have been here so much the only thing i haven’t done in this house is have seder dinner” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story mr cohen oversees comcast’s robust lobbying operation and sets the strategies to shepherd its acquisitions past antitrust questions and other regulatory concerns it’s a big job — and one that would fully occupy almost anyone else — because comcast’s appetite for expansion is large and it needs to be fed with a frequency that some find alarmingfounded by ralph j roberts in  comcast began as a cable television provider in tupelo miss with  customers for many years it grew like a traditional cable company — by stringing wire and signing up subscribers at  mr roberts serves as chairman emeritus and still comes into the office several times a week mr cohen was hired in  by brian l roberts the chief executive and a son of the founder after the company agreed to acquire att’s broadband unit but before the transaction won approval from regulatorsseven years later mr cohen led the effort to win support at the federal communications commission for another huge merger — comcast’s deal to acquire nbc universal which put the company in control of a television network and made it a player for the first time in contentcomcast is already the nation’s largest cable and broadband provider its february announcement of a  billion deal to acquire time warner cable — which is no  in cable and no  in internet — cast mr cohen once again as the point man in a highstakes regulatory fight it was mr cohen not mr roberts who testified this month when the senate judiciary committee held a hearing on the transaction but campaigning for the merger will not consume all of his time because well nothing does just about anything of consequence that occurs within comcast gets at least some of his attentionin the tempest late last year over the lack of a black female cast member on “saturday night live” for example mr cohen advised in his role as company wise man — or as he has been called consigliere to mr roberts “i received a lot of the calls” mr cohen says “we devised what we were going to say we ended up brokering a meeting between lorne michaels” — the show’s longtime producer — “and some of the advocacy groups which he was good enough to take he was terrific about it he didn’t give any promises but he said ‘we’ve had diverse talent we have diverse guests i’m not happy about where we are right now either’ they backed off for a couple of months and he hired someone”more recently mr cohen got involved in a minor issue concerning a television program — complaints by some viewers that “friday night tykes” a reality show about youth football on the esquire network partly owned by nbc universal was glorifying unsafe play perhaps it would not otherwise have risen to mr cohen’s level but he is the company’s political weather vane and it certainly mattered to him that among those offended by “friday night tykes” was senator richard j durbin of illinois the senate’s secondranking democrat “there was a little bit of an issue with the show and an issue with dick durbin” is how mr cohen puts it he requested dvds watched a couple of episodes at home and concluded that there was “one bad scene” but that the program largely condemned the behaviors its critics said it was extolling photo mr cohen second from right at a  benefit in philadelphia for the usc shoah foundation institute others who attended included brian roberts third from right comcast’s chief executive edward rendell third from left former governor of pennsylvania and the filmmaker steven spielberg center credit jemal countessgetty images mr cohen has as well gotten into the weeds of comcast’s cable and broadband customer service — a fraught subject since surveys have consistently shown that the industry in general and comcast in particular are held in low regard by consumers he has even gone on talk radio shows in philadelphia to take calls from customers a duty that few executives at his pay grade — mr cohen pulled in just short of  million in compensation over the last two years — would seek advertisement continue reading the main story “i point out we get over  million service calls a year” he says “a million a day so if we do a great job on  percent of them then we are going to have three million people” who are angry — “and we do a great job on way more than  percent”mr cohen says he believes that comcast has improved its service an opinion informed by the tenor of his talk radio appearances ninety percent of the callers used to complain but now he estimates that as many as a third have good things to say about a home service call “they’ll say ‘he was on time he was polite before he came in my house he put bootees on his shoes to make sure he didn’t track in dirt’ which by the way is part of our protocol” a master of preparationmr cohen grew up in highland park nj and by his own account was a serious young man from an early age at  he was already saying he wanted to be a lawyeras a freshman at swarthmore college he knocked at the dorm room of david g bradley now chairman of atlantic media which publishes the atlantic monthly and several other publications mr bradley a junior was running for vice president of the student body “he said he wanted to be my staff aide” mr bradley says “i don’t think i knew what that meant but we began to work together”as part of the campaign mr bradley had to prepare a talk on the state of the student body “david said he would work on that and he produced about  pages of interview notes and executive notes i don’t think anyone had ever seen anything like that before”mr cohen who has remained close to mr bradley smiles when reminded of the longago campaign “that’s just my view of the world” he says “always be more prepared than anyone else because there’s a huge advantage to knowing everything that might be asked and having given at least some thought to the answer”in some ways mr cohen’s role at comcast is a reprise of his job with mr rendell the indispensable man working across dizzyingly disparate subject areas but there are significant differences philadelphia was in such desperate financial straits back then that buzz bissinger titled his book about mr rendell’s first term “a prayer for the city” comcast on the other hand is a big healthy aggressive entity — one its critics view as being on a triumphant march across americabrian roberts is widely considered comcast’s visionary the man who saw that a cable company could grow into an empire that competes across multiple arenas in a telephone interview he praised mr cohen’s “extraordinary level of detail his preparation his ability to galvanize a team” all of it he said adds up to his “knowing how to win” advertisement continue reading the main story the purchase of time warner cable will be reviewed by the justice department for antitrust concerns as well as by the fcc and by regulators in some states the process is expected to extend for many months if the merger goes through the combined company will operate in  of the nation’s  biggest metropolitan markets and serve about  million households and businessescomcast views itself as a communications and technology company when its executives talk about their competitors they tick off the names of bigger global corporations — apple and google for example they argue that comcast must continue to become bigger to have the scale to innovate and compete photo mr cohen in a meeting at comcast’s headquarters credit tracie van auken for the new york times mr cohen approaches his advocacy for comcast’s transactions like the litigator he once was “it’s the same way you build a case you understand all the facts down to a minute level” he says “and then you pull the lens back so everyone else can understand it and organize the advocacy in a way that is compelling and persuasive”he makes several points about the merger with time warner cable the two companies do not compete in the same cable markets so the deal in his view will have no impact on consumers and both companies have been losing cable subscribers about a million combined just in  — perhaps most of them “cordcutters” who watch television without cable “if we’re a monopoly we are the dumbest monopoly that has ever existed on the face of this earth” he saysof course comcast has been steadily gaining broadband customers — from fewer than seven million in  to more than  million in  it’s a point that mr cohen with a lawyer’s gift for emphasizing only the facts in his favor does not highlight and broadband much more than cable is likely to be the focus of regulators “i think almost everyone uses the facts that help them” he says newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify

email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime michael copps a former commissioner on the fcc now serves as the special adviser to common cause’s media and democracy reform initiative he says of mr cohen “he is a delightful person very professional in going about his work but people also recognize how close he is personally to people in positions of great power from the president on down those kinds of connections that he and his company have cultivated translate into a lot of credibility in washington”mr copps was the commission’s lone dissenting vote on comcast’s merger with nbc universal and he opposes the merger with time warner cable “this is about the whole future of broadband which a lot of people thought would be exempt from the consolidation that was visited upon radio and tv”mr cohen contends that comcast has no incentive to use its dominant position in broadband to “throttle” traffic or to make it more difficult for socalled edge providers like netflix or hulu to reach their audiences “the existence of those edge providers is exactly what enables us to sell more broadband and make more money” he sayshe has walked a fine line as to whether comcast will charge consumers more for this service he says prices may continue to rise but not because of anything in this particular transaction advertisement continue reading the main story a political money raiserwhen mr cohen joined comcast its washington office consisted of one professional and an administrative assistant it now has about  people working in a building one block from the capitol among them is meredith attwell baker who left her post as an fcc commissioner to take a job with comcast just six months after she had voted in favor of the company’s merger with nbc universal“the game is that money talks” says kathy kiely managing editor of the sunlight foundation which tracks the influence of political giving on government policy “david cohen is one of those folks who has made an art form out of it if you raise money for politicians you are trying to exercise and access influence and he does it very well”mr cohen’s political connections which he began building in his years with mr rendell allow him to make his case not just in hearing rooms but also in more private settings“so i go to see senator booker” he says at one point talking about cory booker the democratic former mayor of newark “i’ve known him since before he was mayor” he refers to john hickenlooper the colorado governor a democrat as “another friend of mine” he says eric cantor the republican house majority leader “has become a very good personal friend” photo senator al franken has been one of comcast’s most persistent critics credit chris kleponisgetty images “we spend  percent of our time talking about israel  percent talking about our wives and families and maybe  percent talking about cable industry issues” mr cohen says of mr cantor “and maybe  percent of that is comcast”mr cohen estimates that since he joined comcast he and his wife rhonda have made personal contributions to political candidates that total in “the high six figures or maybe low seven figures it’s somewhere in that universe” the three fundraisers he hosted for president obama in philadelphia two of them at his house raised more than  millionmr cohen is widely considered affable and patient in negotiations not one to personalize business conflicts but he does broadly categorize those who oppose comcast interests “you can’t let yourself be influenced by the really fringe consumer progressive organizations who in every single transaction that has occurred in the media space wail that the sky is going to fall and the world is going to end as we know it”senator al franken has been one of comcast’s most persistent critics and he was the most aggressive questioner at the recent judiciary committee hearing “a smart guy” with “a pathological bias” is how mr cohen described mr franken several weeks before that hearing at a forum at the university of pennsylvania’s school of law senator franken says he opposes the deal because he thinks it will be bad for consumers advertisement continue reading the main story mr cohen is not registered as a lobbyist — the rules require it only for those who spend at least  percent of their time lobbying — and he bristles when he is referred to as one because of his association with mr rendell who also served two terms as pennsylvania’s governor and now president obama many assume he is a straightdowntheline democrat he says that was never the case — he grew up with republican parents and was one of what he believes to have been four republican students at swarthmore during his time there — but the rightward drift of the party drove him away and for many years the bulk of his giving was to democratshis giving and fundraising on behalf of candidates is now split more evenly though it still tilts toward democrats the same is true of the money that comcast gives through its political action committee — as well as of the political contributions made by most of its top executives including mr roberts“my priorities in political giving are comcast priorities” mr cohen says “i don’t kid myself my goals are to support the interests of the company”“that makes me a very purple person and rhonda as well” he says “rhonda left to her own devices would give to many fewer republicans than i would”mr cohen says he understands the criticism that he has access most citizens do not “but i also don’t believe in unilateral disarmament” he says “we have a lot of opponents a lot of competitors they are all equally involved in the political process”when mr cohen hosted a fundraiser at his home in the mount airy section of philadelphia last year for gov tom corbett of pennsylvania a republican it was frontpage news in the philadelphia inquirer at the university of pennsylvania law forum a student asked how he could support a candidate who did not have “a liberal progressive bone in his body”“so let me guess” said mr cohen who is chairman of the university’s board of trustees “you’re not a member of penn republicans”he then defended the governor as an honorable and compassionate man but he said the fundraiser did not necessarily confer his support he said he didn’t yet know whom he would vote for “we have a bunch of democrats running for governor” he said “and they’re all my friends too” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats
