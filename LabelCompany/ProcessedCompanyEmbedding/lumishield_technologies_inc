coatings could replace toxic chromium on wearresistant surfaces in joint replacement implants automotive lumishield coatings offer an elegant solution to galvanic corrosion issues arising from the use of steel fasteners in aluminumframed vehicles aerospace lumishield coatings are a less expensive alternative to vapor deposited aluminum coatings currently used in the aerospace industry infrastructure the ability to apply lumishield coatings in open environments may substantially reduce the costs of placing protective layers on existing metallic structures electronics lumishield technology will ultimately be adaptable to the production of transition metal alloy coatings which have many applications in electronics manufacture manufacturing once anodized lumishield coatings provide a strong wearresistant surface which will see application in a variety of machine components and tools marine lumishield coatings will show excellent resistance to saline environments making them ideal for corrosion protection in maritime applications consumer goods with a variety of finishes possible through coplating and anodizing lumishield coatings offer a new look in consumer markets metal corrosion costs the us economy  billion each year lumishield can change that lumishield’s technology has the potential to change the way the world handles metal corrosion commercialization of the lumishield process will have impacts on many industries including biomedical automotive aerospace infrastructure marine electronics and consumer goods lumishield’s simplified process and lower metal costs will likely result in a decreased cost to the end user which will allow lumishield to rapidly create a place in the  billion metal coatings market in addition to its lower costs lumishield’s technology has already sparked interest from major manufacturing corporations for its potential to improve worker safety and reduce environmental impact cadmium and chromium – two of the most common anticorrosion coatings – are harmful to the environment and regulations on their use continue to become more restrictive while some aluminum plating options already exist those currently on the market require substantial operating costs to mitigate toxic vapor emissions and exclude atmospheric water which interferes with plating lumishield’s technology has none of these limitations our company is leveraging advanced sciences to create electroplated aluminum products that will be safe for workers better for the environment and cheaper for companies ﻿ lumishield home  contact   mission market investors customers technology our edge team contact ﻿lumishield has devised a solution to the challenge of corrosion of steel components in our proprietary electroplating system aluminum films in a variety of thicknesses may be deposited on steel the electroplated aluminum layer created by the lumishield process forms a hard selfhealing aluminum oxide layer upon contact with air protecting the surface this process represents a major advance over current technology in a number of respects it may be conducted in open vessels without production of organic vapors or interference from atmospheric water meaning it can be conducted in existing electroplating equipment additionally the large electrochemical window of the electrolyte grants greater freedom in operational parameters and hence improved process flexibility because the process can be conducted with full exposure to air it can also be adapted to brush plating which allows the fabrication of large and irregularly shaped components without the need for major capital equipment installations taken together these technical advantages translate into improved versatility diminished environmental impact and reduced cost for lumishield products ﻿ lumishield home  contact   mission market investors customers technology our edge team contact ﻿ what lumishield can provide for you

environmentally harmful advanced materials and processes can create solutions to technological problems which produce superior results without increasing cost or environmental impact lumishield was founded to develop these improved solutions in the area of corrosionresistant metal products existing coatings such as chromium and cadmium are both expensive and environmentally harmful lumishield technology uses a relatively harmless metal aluminum and a process which can be conducted in open vessels at ambient conditions without creating toxic vapors these qualities allow lumishield products to be produced less expensively without the historic environmental impacts of metal plating lumishield’s mission is to revolutionize the metal plating industry by creating anticorrosion products that are costeffective and environmentally responsible lumishield aims to do this by using advanced materials and processes to develop aluminum electroplating technologies that can replace the harmful and

technologies inc all rights reserved a technology developed by researchers at the national energy technology laboratory netl and carnegie mellon university cmu has been recognized with a prestigious excellence in technology transfer award from the federal laboratory consortium for technology transfer flc the award presented annually recognizes outstanding work by laboratory employees in transferring technology developed in federal laboratories to the commercial marketplace the awardwinning technology is a revolutionary costeffective coating process to protect metal products from corrosion the process creates a protective barrier by electrodepositing aluminum in place of heavy metals such as chromium and cadmium which are expensive and environmentally harmful the new “green” process represents a major advancement over current technology improving versatility diminishing environmental impact and reducing cost for corrosionresistant coatings lumishield technologies a pittsburghbased startup company was established to advance the technology into a commercial process netl’s technology transfer program manager jessica sosenko praised lumishield’s efforts “the success of the technology transfer process was directly related to the ability of lumishield to secure foundational seed funding from aecom one of netl’s site support contractors” said sosenko “these funds were instrumental in advancing the technology towards commercial readiness allowing lumishield representatives to successfully negotiate separate exclusive licenses with cmu and netl” this novel fabrication technology has the potential to change the way the world handles metal corrosion commercialization of the lumishield process will benefit many industries including biomedical automotive aerospace infrastructure marine electronics and consumer goods the simplified process and lower costs will likely result in a decreased cost to the end user which will allow lumishield to rapidly carve out a place in the  billion metalcoatings market the potential of the technology has been recognized by the local investment community which has provided lumishield with financial support and businessdevelopment services in addition the national science foundation has awarded lumishield a  small business innovation research phase i award commercialization of technologies developed with stakeholder support will translate into job creation and improved products for america’s citizens the transfer of this technology to the energy marketplace aligns with netl’s mission to discover integrate and mature technology solutions to enhance the nation’s energy foundation and protect the environment for future generations flc is a nationwide network of federal laboratories that promotes the rapid transfer of laboratory research results and technologies into the marketplace netl is one of more than  federal laboratories and centers that comprise the flc applications for this prestigious award were reviewed by a panel of technology transfer experts representing industry state and local government academia and the federal laboratory system the award will be presented at a
