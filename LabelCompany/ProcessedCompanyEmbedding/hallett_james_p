you for joining us today for the kar auction services first quarter  earnings conference call today we will discuss the financial performance of kar auction services for the quarter ended march

affect kars business prospects and results of operations and such risks are fully detailed in our sec filings in providing forwardlooking statements the company expressly disclaims any obligation to

the applicable gaap financial measure can be found in the press release that we issued yesterday which is also available in the investor relations section of our website now id like to turn this call over to kar auction services ceo jim hallett jim james p hallett  kar auction services inc thank you michael and good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our call let me start with laying out what i plan on covering on todays call in my comments i want to provide a update on our guidance for  give you an overview of our performance in the first quarter discuss what were seeing in the marketplaces that we serve id like to talk about a couple of key strategies that we have going on within kar and then provide you with some information on our acquisition of drivin that was announced in midapril and then id like to finish up with an update on our plans to refinance our existing debt so starting with our guidance for  i can tell you that i feel very very good about our performance of our businesses and more or so our outlook as we continue to move forward there are no changes to our previous guidance as you saw in our earnings release the cars are coming to auctions and as i like to say nobody is stockpiling these vehicles these vehicles are primarily commercial vehicles offlease vehicles repos and fleet vehicles and these cars are going to sell they traditionally sell at a very high conversion rate the first time through and if they dont sell first time through for one reason or another we know theyre definitely going to get sold second time through the vehicles are not leaving our auction once they arrive there so with that said i would also mention that we continue to see the value in the complementary nature of our various businesses that weve spoken about many times and again i remain positive not only in the near term but in the longer term outlook for kar as i look at our first quarter performance the quarter fell right in line with our consolidated expectations we had a solid performance at insurance auto auctions where were seeing strong top and bottomline growth in the salvage industry or in the salvage business i was most pleased that we were able to control the sga in this segment and we saw the increased volumes and revenues drive strong growth in the adjusted ebitda inventory levels at iaa were up  over the prior year at march  and i would mention that the relatively mild winter conditions allowed us to reduce the backlog of vehicles which definitely served as a bonus for our insurance customers we still have strong inventory levels and this bodes very well in terms of setting up the second quarter at afc results were generally in line with our expectations as we mentioned in our yearend call we said that we would see more moderate growth in the number of the loan transactions throughout  we now have visibility into the second and third quarter performance we will continue to see elevated loan losses in the second quarter like we experienced in the first quarter however with that said we are seeing substantial improvement late in the second quarter and into the third quarter on our current performance in the loan portfolio and we continue to expect that loan losses for  will be in the  to the  for the year that we outlined on our previous call like the other business segments adesas performance fell in line with our expectations with that said the monthtomonth performance within the quarter was what i would term as very choppy we had a strong january and a strong march and in between february was a different story as it fell well below our expectations this was consistent with retail sales of used cars in the us where delays in the processing of tax refunds had an impact normally we would not be discussing our performance trends on a monthtomonth basis but i did feel it was important to mention this as it did impact our margins in the first quarter the better news or the good news is that the supply of commercial vehicles continues to be remain very strong throughout  a couple of trends that were seeing going on within our business very positive trends in the salvage business miles driven is growing and fuel prices remain relatively low were seeing improvement in commodity prices that will contribute to higher auction values at the low end of the salvage market lower used car prices increase the likelihood of an accident resulting in a total loss technology and safety advancements are also increasing the likelihood of insurance claims resulting in a total loss and one of the challenges in the growth of the salvage business is space constraints and we expect that we will be adding hundreds of acres of land to meet the needs of our customers in the salvage business in  and i would point out that this expansion of acquiring this land was contemplated in our guidance for  our finance business afc is experiencing slower growth this year as expected the word i would use to describe our lending practices at afc is disciplined very disciplined we have not changed our risk tolerance or our underwriting practices we are expecting slower growth at afc than in our other businesses but this is due to the market served by the independent used car dealers who is the primary customer at afc for adesa i mentioned the choppiness of the performance in the first quarter and let me clarify that choppy does not mean bad the supply of commercial vehicles will be well above our prioryear levels and all of these cars will get sold as i mentioned earlier we expect used car prices to decline about  in  due to the increased supply with that said none of this changes our outlook for adesa in  a couple of areas of strategic focus going on within kar is we are focused on entering new international markets and becoming a key player in the markets that we serve we have started this strategic initiative in the uk we are seeing excellent progress in the uk market as we develop a platform for meaningful growth in future years we continue to see great interest in our online and our mobile technologies in the uk market and we have confirmed that we can be a disruptive competitor in these new markets with an assetlight business model and my goal is to see the uk market become a meaningful contributor to our consolidated results in the next couple of years and now we are beginning to focus on other geographies we have been in the process of developing a pipeline of potential acquisitions in new international markets another strategic initiative that were focused on is bringing improved data and analytical capabilities to our customers this begins by leveraging the significant data generated by the large number of transactions processed in all of kars businesses we have developed a data science team that is focused on taking large amounts of disparate data and turning it into actionable intelligence we have introduced our data science capabilities to a number of customers and we are now working on specific projects designed to help our customers navigate the changing used car marketplace integrating our data and analytics capabilities with our mobile online and physical offerings will be an important differentiator for all of our businesses we need to help our customers make better decisions on when and what channel and at what price to sell their vehicles and that is why we acquired drivin drivin will be an important component of our data and analytics offerings first the drivin organization brings key talent to our team that will allow us to accelerate the pace of developing solutions for our customers they will work out of their current chicago location and will give us access to the data science talent that is forming in the chicago hightech community we are integrating the drivin team with our existing data science team and our technologybased service platforms within adesa the drivin team will clearly contribute to our existing customers at adesa and especially our commercial consigners and our online businesses we expect we will see the results of their work in our organic growth within adesa recently ive been spending considerable time with many of our major customers and if there is one hot button that customers are talking to me about is how can we help them make better decisions on selling their vehicles especially with the onslaught of these offlease cars that are coming to the market so with that said im very very excited that i was able to announce to our customers that weve doubled down on our data science team that we have acquired drivin and weve brought this talent and this technology into our organization so with that let me finish with a brief comment on our plans to refinance our debt current market conditions are making it possible for us to refinance our current debt at lower interest rates at the same time we may have an opportunity to issue bonds that fix the interest rate on a portion of our debt and eric will cover this in more detail here in a few moments as i look on the last  days since our last call a lot has happened and i am pleased with the performance and i like how our businesses are positioned weve been able to respond to the market conditions and deliver on our targets we continued to benefit from the complementary nature of all of kars businesses we have strategic initiatives in place that will provide a platform for continued growth and we will continue to generate a lot of cash and we will find ways to use that cash to create shareholder value this is a great time to be in this industry and its a great time to be part of kar ill now turn it over to eric for his comments well come back to you for some qa and maybe some closing comments from myself with that ill give it to eric thank you eric eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc thank you jim i would like to cover a couple of items in more detail let me start with a quick overview of our consolidated results revenues grew  in the first quarter which led to an  increase in adjusted ebitda and a  increase in operating adjusted net income per share we benefited from a lower effective income tax rate in the first quarter as the benefit from stockbased compensation is recognized as a reduction in income tax expense beginning in  in accordance with the new accounting pronouncements on accounting for stockbased compensation previously this income tax benefit was recorded as an increase in additional paidin capital i would like to point out that the impact on our first quarter effective tax rate is higher than what we expect the impact to be for the full year a majority of our stockbased compensation programs have vesting dates in the first quarter now let me speak to a couple of items affecting the results of our business segments adesa had  growth in revenue and  growth in adjusted ebitda gross profit as a percent of revenue was down slightly but this is consistent with our expectations when revenue growth is driven by the increase in revenue per unit as it was in the first quarter while volume growth was attributable to the onlineonly sales and acquired auction locations the improvement in revenue per unit reflects the impact of the shift in mix of commercial vehicles to  of vehicles sold in  from  of vehicles sold at physical auction in  while our samestore volume growth was only  in the first quarter and flat yearoveryear at physical auctions i remind you that we had a tough comparison when looking back to last years first quarter which was up  for total volume and  for the samestore yearoveryear despite the modest increase in volume we still had  samestore revenue growth in the first quarter as jim mentioned earlier february really weighed on our adjusted ebitda margins in the first quarter this was seen in the slight decrease in incremental adjusted ebitda margins on a samestore basis the good news is our integration activities are well underway and we saw an increased adjusted ebitda margin from our acquired businesses in q insurance auto auctions performance in the first quarter was excellent doubledigit volume growth drove doubledigit revenue growth increased gross profit as a percent of revenue and an  increase in adjusted ebitda while revenue per vehicle sold was flat yearoveryear we are seeing signs of improvement in scrap prices that could be a positive factor in future quarters the afc segment is a little bit more difficult to analyze the provision for credit losses is recorded as a reduction in net revenue for our finance company accordingly net revenue declined in the first quarter as compared to the prior year the number of loan transactions in q was flat in comparison to the prior year and the provision for loan losses negatively impacted revenue per loan transaction by  as compared to the prior year excluding the impact of the provision for loan losses we saw a nice growth in fee and interest income as a result of higher average loan balances and a modest increase in interest rates charged to our customers we are seeing improved performance in the portfolio for new loans that is consistent with our expectations for lower loan losses in the second half of the year loan losses as a percent of managed receivables were  in the first quarter and will remain at elevated levels in the second quarter now turning to our guidance for  our outlook has not changed we expect adjusted ebitda of  million to  million net income per share of  to  and operating adjusted net income per share of  to  although our guidance has not changed we have considered the impact of our proposed refinancing and repricing of existing debt the acquisition of drivin and the impact of stockbased compensation on our effective income tax rate in determining and updating our expectations for  now let me discuss in more detail our plans to refinance and reprice our existing debt we currently have approximately  billion of debt outstanding this represents the aggregate borrowings under term loan b term loan b and our revolving credit facility based on discussions with our advisors we believe we can refinance a portion of our debt by issuing unsecured senior notes at a fixed rate the remaining senior secured debt may be repriced at lower interest costs than the current facilities the effort to refinance and reprice our debt will be pursued on a best effortsbasis and there is no assurance as to the amount or timing of the proposed transactions so that concludes my prepared remarks ill turn it back to chelsea and we will now take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of elizabeth suzuki with bank of america your line is now open elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch good morning guys your tax rate was fairly low in q and you mentioned the impact of stockbased comp but you maintained your full year expectation of  do you think that your effective tax rate is really going to be  for the rest of the year to make that  for the full year or is that just some conservatism on your part eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc well liz its what we think but its driven by the fact that this benefit is all in q ill have  a full year of earnings if it has an impact it will be fairly minor relative to the effective tax rate and what we expected at the beginning of the year and our higher tax rate is really driven by state taxes more than federal taxes and thats the unpredictable portion is what will it actually turn out to be im hoping for good news but not counting on it elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch okay great thanks in next quarter the brashers acquisition will have anniversaried so again as were thinking about organic volume growth what are your expectations for the rest of the year obviously we have some somewhat tough comps so i mean do you think somewhere in the mid singledigits is reasonable for organic growth or is it likely to kind of stay in the lower range james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah liz i would think that we would expect it to be in that midsingledigit range or perhaps a little bit better as we look at – we have a good feel for the existing business for the new business weve been able to put in place and then with the volumes that are coming as eric would say we feel good about mid single digits and we would hope that it could be a little bit higher in that elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch great and ill just squeeze in one more quick one which is with used vehicle pricing coming down on a likeforlike basis do you think its reasonable to assume that your revenue per vehicle at adesa could continue to trend positively just due to mix shift or do you expect to see some pressure there by the end of the year james p hallett  kar auction services inc no first and foremost i would say that with pricing – although you didnt necessarily ask it this way were very focused on the transaction were very focused on getting the car and selling the car and we know that more and more of these cars are going to be these offlease cars and as they get to physical auctions they are the heavy users of these ancillary services and now were starting to see revenues that start with an eight and those are the numbers that we havent seen in the past so i think our revenues continue to improve elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch great thanks very much eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc youre welcome liz operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of bret jordan with jefferies your line is now open bret jordan  jefferies llc hey good morning guys eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc hi bret bret jordan  jefferies llc a couple quick questions and i guess ill start with dealer consignment and obviously it stabilized sequentially in the quarter could you give us maybe an outlook and where we might expect to see the trends go from here i think it had gone from sort of a minus  midyear last year to minus  and obviously given the comparisons and some of the dealer trends could you maybe give us an outlook james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah bret first of all i can tell you that its very much in line with our expectations and what we were thinking it would come in at before we went into the recession if you go back a number of years we were heavily weighted on commercial where were  commercial and  dealer and as we worked our way through the recession were able to bring that balance to  and we always felt that as we went into the cyclical recovery that there would be no question that the offlease cars would displace some of these dealer consignment cars and quite frankly it didnt happen as fast as we thought it would happen it held up stronger as you probably heard me say before we currently i think eric reported were  commercial in the quarter and  dealer we think that number will look somewhere like  when its all said and done we think thats kind of the numbers that were pointing to and thats what our expectation would be bret jordan  jefferies llc okay great and then on the iaa weve heard a lot about hail and flooding in the recent past are we seeing any sort of catastrophic event growth in the current quarter around iaa and just sort of a second question on iaa while i have you whats the export volume looking like is there any change either around a strong dollar or relative change to the dollar versus the volumes that are sold at iaa that are going overseas james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah so let me first of all say catastrophic events hail storms hurricanes snow sleet ice all that stuff related those events are always going to be part of our industry always part of what we do we dont factor them in one way or the other normally when they happen they are obviously to our benefit and theyre good for our business and its good that we can provide this service for our customers so not predictable not something that we build into our plans but when they happen its good for our business so with that the second part of the question on the exporting in the currency im going to let eric take that eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc yeah bret good question were still seeing active export activity even though the us dollar is strong gross auction proceeds or average price paid for a vehicle has come down to the point where it seems to be a very attractive transaction and we havent seen anything that has caused a change in the interest by the international buyer and again we see plenty of cars going overseas thats always been in that  to  of the vehicles and its probably about that same amount right now going to wherever theyre buying the vehicles bret jordan  jefferies llc okay great thank you appreciate it james p hallett  kar auction services inc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matt fassler with goldman sachs your line is now open matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co thanks a lot good morning james p hallett  kar auction services inc good morning eric matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co a couple questions first on the whole car business and this was asked i think a couple questions ago maybe a bit differently so we have a couple quarters now under our belt with  unit growth ex acquisitions and i know you talked about the impact of the election in q and then you had the tax rebate issue impacting the entire market plus a very stiff compare in q jim when you were talking about mid single digits or a bit better than that was that essentially discussing the organic unit growth so would that suggest that without those impediments to the market and with some more normative compare you could see a bit of acceleration underlying the guide for the rest of the year james p hallett  kar auction services inc that would be a yes matt matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co okay and then secondly also on whole car eric you talked about i guess one unusual factor that impeded the incremental margins a little bit in the whole car business should we be targeting something in the  to  range as kind of a sustainable incremental margin rate with the kind of line that you guys are discussing eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc matt again we talked about february really impacting incremental margins and we saw great movement on the integration of those activities and as was pointed out earlier we anniversaried those we still think we can have stronger incremental margins than the mids on the invested business matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co got it and then finally on afc so there was a point in time call it a year ago when you had talked about increasing competition and presumably some irrational pricing gunning for that business i know that the issue for the moment is more loan losses than anything else were familiar with whats going on in the market should we assume based on what you said about taking rates a bit higher that some of the competition that had been entering the market and impeding profitability is pulling back giving you the opportunity for sustained better pricing is that visible and  are people responding to that market adversity james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah matt i think good point and i would call it responsible behavior i think people have pulled their horns in a little bit and are acting in a more responsible way in terms of how we look at extending credit eric you might want to add to that eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc right i wouldnt call it pulling back but i dont think theyre using the pricing component as a competitive lever thats what i would say matt theyre still in the marketplace aggressively pursuing market share there still seems to be ample credit available for customers and in some cases more than we would like to lend and were making sure that we arent involved in those customers where they have too much credit thats really where were focused matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co understood gentlemen thank you so much james p hallett  kar auction services inc thank you matt operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ben bienvenu with stephens inc your line is now open benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc yeah thanks good morning james p hallett  kar auction services inc good morning benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc focusing on the adesa business the gross margin is under pressure understandably given the mix shift towards institutional commercial volume what are some of the things that you can do operationally to sustain or prop up that margin and help alleviate some of the pressure as a function of mix james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah i think a couple of things really there is two things that stand out to me is number one is we absolutely have to get these integrations completed that we acquired in  we acquired a lot of businesses in  i wont go through them all i think youre familiar with them but its completing those integrations and then the other thing that weve been focused on – i spoke a little bit about data and analytics and the acquisition that we made there weve also brought a lot of talent into the organization and what i would term is key talent senior levels highly comp – and this is really bringing the skill set in to support what were doing in terms of growing the business and just growing the things that our customers are expecting of us now for the most part those jobs have been filled the most part were well into the middle innings of integration and i think you should see those margins start to improve in the back half of the year eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc and were referring to gross margin as well on that ben because part of what we do is go in with a management operating system that really focuses on maintaining direct labor in line with the volume running through the auction so you should see it at both the gross margin line as well as the adjusted ebitda margin line benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc thats great color thanks switching gears to iaa you came into the quarter with inventory buildup  you reported  volume growth and then you ended the quarter with inventory up  am i right to think that perhaps activity slowed in january february while you were selling through the inventory you had at the end of the quarter and then picked back up in march sort of coming into q and if so is that just a function of milder weather that we saw during the quarter maybe help me think through some of the sequencing of that james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah ill start that conversation and then let eric weigh in as well at iaa there is a much longer holding period for these vehicles the average days to sell from the time that the car arrives to the time that it is sold is somewhere in the order of approximately  days and so what you get there is you get an overlap of when the car arrives and when it actually gets sold and it could arrive in one quarter and go into the next quarter so you have to think about the processing and the time that it takes to process those vehicles with that eric you want to add eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc yeah and ben id point out last years first quarter was up  over  again i dont want to complain about our comps because theyre great news in the past but we were up against a tough compare we had very strong flowthrough in the auctions and the weather actually helped us get more cars out and that helped us reduce that inventory level a little bit which is what our insurance carriers were pursuing so i would tell you it was all good news in the first quarter in the way it came together benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc thats great and then just one last one on the acquisition strategy you highlighted some international markets that youre looking at i assume both potentially adesa and iaa how do you think about the sort of critical mass that you need to achieve when entering a new market to make the economics work on that business and what kind of pace do you think about is the pipeline relatively robust or is this – i would assume its a longerterm time horizon to sort out build out the capacity that you might need james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah so a couple things there that id mention is first and foremost i would say that were focused on mature vehicle markets where the cars are and i think a great way to maybe explain it – a good way for me to explain it is to take a look at what we did in the uk we went into the uk we focused on businesses that we feel we know something about businesses that we operate here in north america we wanted to buy smaller existing businesses that have a customer base that we could grow in the businesses and we did it in salvage we did it in an online platform with grs and we introduced traderev but maybe really really key was our focus on the management team whenever you go into these international markets certainly i believe that i and the management team support the fact that theres nobody from north america going over there to tell these people how to run their business and we have to have management teams that were very confident in that not only know and understand the business that are interested in staying locked down and being part of our business going forward and weve been successful in doing that so as we look at these businesses and we look at new geographies were really looking at opportunities in all of our businesses could be in salvage whole car could be with some of our other products and some of our services a lot of our technologies that are very much in demand around the world that dont exist in other parts of the world so its kind of assessing and prioritizing and looking at them one at a time and then i guess the great debate is which one comes first and thats something that we just have to take one step at a time in terms of where we get to with the seller and at what point we get there but i would tell you without getting specific there are a number of opportunities and we feel good about where we are in those discussions and we feel even better about where we are in those relationships and the things that we think about that are important to us so with that said i would say we hope to be able to deliver you some good news on that front going forward eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc and ill add we want to get started quickly but this is a multiyear effort because what weve learned is when we buy these businesses we need to allow time for integration and to nurture them and bring to them the capabilities of kar so look to get started as quickly as they make sense but it will be over multiple years that we build out that capability in new markets benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc okay thanks guys best of luck james p hallett  kar auction services inc thank you operator thank you thank you and our next question comes from the line of ryan brinkman with jpmorgan your line is now open samik x chatterjee  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is samik here on behalf of ryan jim thanks for your comments on new wave and just wanted to check with you particularly in terms of timing based on the progress youve made do you still feel comfortable with the timing i think you earlier have mentioned that you should be able to launch something later this year earlier on this call you mentioned you are doing specific projects with new wave and also in terms of technical capabilities looks like drivin will be helping in the launch of new wave do you think you need more capabilities more technical capabilities or acquisitions to sort of provide a integrated platform to the customer james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah so if i got all your questions let me say first of all new wave we obviously announced the capital investment of  million  million over the next three years i would say were at the very front of that project obviously weve begun the work but were in the early stages and really nothing more than i can report other than i believe that the feedback from our employees and the feedback from our customers have been very positive as ive been out talking with customers and visiting with customers theyre very complimentary of the fact that we continue to make the investment in new wave with that said your comment on drivin i would ask you to think of drivin as a complementary service or a complementary company to what takes place within new wave and within some of our other products and service offerings as well and is there an opportunity to acquire more businesses like drivin i think you asked i would say to you if there was an opportunity that came along and made sense and it was a good fit and we thought it would even build out our service more obviously we would take a look at it because in the big scheme of things these are relatively small investments samik x chatterjee  jpmorgan securities llc got it got it and secondly just on the iaa group the average revenue per unit there was roughly consistent with q last year and this is despite a pretty strong increase that we saw in crushed auto body prices im wondering what the headwinds probably there were you mentioned the export market is still quite strong so maybe what headwinds are you seeing thats offsetting the better commodity environment there eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc the commodity environment that we read about is typically being driven by the recyclers we have a little bit of a lag before we typically see it in the prices paid at the salvage auctions so thats why im optimistic as i mentioned in my commentary that well see it in future quarters because seeing it hold – we saw some increases last year that didnt hold and it never really was seen in the lowend car right now were seeing some positive trends where we think it will start showing up as we get later in the year and come through so the recycling that – or the commodity prices youre seeing really are related to what the recyclers are selling their crushed auto body for after theyve bought our car samik x chatterjee  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for taking up the questions eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of craig kennison with baird your line is now open craig r kennison  robert w baird  co inc good morning thank you for taking my questions so hertz recently called out the uber risk to the car rental model what is your exposure to the rental fleet and how do you assess the opportunity with ridesharing over time james p hallett  kar auction services inc great question i would say in a word opportunity as you think about ridesharing these are going to be very very large fleets and these fleets are going to be very much interested in using – i believe in using the auction services number one is theres not only an opportunity to sell these vehicles but i believe that theres going to be an opportunity to maintain and service these vehicles as well which we have facilities that can provide those services which will be a good thing for kar the other area that i expect that could benefit here is many of these cars in ridesharing would be expected to come back with say  miles on them i believe that those vehicles will be very very ripe for the export market and do very very well in the export market the other thing is when you start thinking about ridesharing and you start thinking about cars with  miles on them start to think about the number of turns that these vehicles could take its like when were returning vehicles in the rental fleet every six months right the miles are going to build up very very fast so this isnt a rideshare car coming in and maybe turning once every three years this is possibly ridesharing building up these miles and turning over with much more velocity maybe one or two or three times more than what just a single lease car or rental car would which i believe is going to produce more cars coming into the industry overall craig r kennison  robert w baird  co inc thats great and then i had a question on traderev im just curious where you see the intersection between traderev and openlane and whether having both of those assets has created any new opportunities james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah so when you think about openlane and traderev i do believe that it just gives us an additional channel it gives customers an additional choice in a little bit different environment as you think about openlane were focused on the offlease cars were focused on the privatelabel business and were focused on really really selling those cars in a bid now buy now environment and when you think about traderev traderev is the opportunity to be able to sell vehicles for our dealers and our commercial consigners over a mobile application and again a very short time period an hour in duration happens very very quickly and it just becomes another channel we talk about the waterfall and may be a term that i havent used that much in the past but youll be hearing a lot more about the waterfall as i go forward in the waterfall it used to be that it would go to a closed sale then it would go to an open sale and from an open sale then it would move to a physical sale and as you know we had two exclusive opportunities in the open and the closed sale well now think about traderev becoming another channel in that waterfall so now it would go close it would go open and now were having customers move it to traderev before they go to shipping it to a physical auction so i think there is a real opportunity where traderev comes in and complements whats going on in openlane craig r kennison  robert w baird  co inc thanks and a quick question for eric on drivin how should we expect that to flow thorough the financial statements eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc craig it will have no impact on our expectations in  and beginning in  we think we will see it through our organic growth because again its a dataoriented service offering they have a couple of other revenue platforms that are very insignificant and that will continue but primarily you will see it in our organic growth in the existing businesses of adesa craig r kennison  robert w baird  co inc will it just show up as additional revenue per unit eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc yeah probably more were expecting it could have an impact on conversion rates and therefore the total volume in any of our channels that would be online as well as physical craig r kennison  robert w baird  co inc got it thank you james p hallett  kar auction services inc youre welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matthew page with gabelli  company your line is now open matthew paige  gresearch llc good morning thanks for taking my call james p hallett  kar auction services inc good morning matthew paige  gresearch llc just a couple of questions left for me the first is one technology we havent touched on yet in this call is autoniq so i was wondering if you could just provide an update on that and talk about customer acceptance of the product and where youre seeing the opportunity going james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah so you were very very faint there but i got your question give you an update on autoniq which is another great story we acquired this company a couple years ago its a subscriptionbased business that provides really aggregates the data on the valuation of vehicles from all the different data sources over your iphone we continue to grow that business very very nicely our subscriptions continue to grow we continue to penetrate the franchise as well as the independent market and i would tell you performing not only to our expectations but maybe performing a little beyond our expectations so very very pleased with autoniq and as we think about autoniq now we think about how we can integrate autoniq with some of our other offerings so as you think about openlane you think about traderev you think about some of the things were doing with drivin and we think about data and analytics its how do we bring all those forces together to provide a better outcome for our customers so again glad you asked the question because its a great story matthew paige  gresearch llc great thanks and hopefully this is a little bit better but you also mentioned international opportunities are there any geographic areas in the north american market that you feel that iaa or adesa are not well represented and youd want to expand your presence james p hallett  kar auction services inc i think were well represented in the markets that we certainly want to be in and i get asked this question from investors i would tell you that there is probably a handful of markets that we would still take a look at if they were to come available we would certainly continue to take a look at them nothing imminent or on the radar as we speak right now internationally its wide open i mean the opportunities there its just a question of how soon can we get to them and were probably being very cautious in terms of how fast we go although i do believe speed wins but weve had a couple of press releases here in the last little while about two major pilots we rolled out with two of the largest leasing and fleet companies in the world arval and motability and those pilots have gone very very well where weve seen our customers report back to us theyre pleased with the technology but they are even more pleased with eliminating the days to sell and the fact of the matter is weve been able to achieve more net proceeds than what theyve been able to achieve at the physical auctions that they were using so again a lot of geography a lot of markets a lot of interest not only from dealers but from the fleets and from the oems i believe the opportunity is really unlimited its just a case of how quickly can we get to them matthew paige  gresearch llc great well thanks for taking my call and good luck james p hallett  kar auction services inc thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of bob labick cjs securities your line is now open bob j labick  cjs securities inc thank you and thanks for all the information so far on the call james p hallett  kar auction services inc youre welcome bob j labick  cjs securities inc i want to dig a little deeper in drivin could you talk to us a little bit more about the business model itself is this is a product for the openlane customers the dealer customers or both and do they take inventory or is it just an agency transaction james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah so let me start by saying first of all drivin has a transactional component platform that it can transact business on but that was not what attracted us to the business we were attracted to the business for the analytics capabilities that they have and the talent that they had within their organization as we thought about our data science team and i may have mentioned this before but forgive me for repeating if i am ive been spending a lot of time with customers and what customers are really focused on right now is these volumes that are coming at them and they really have limited information our customers have information on their cars kar has information on cars within the entire industry so we have millions and millions of data points and what our customers have really come to us and the conversations im having along with our senior management team is its kind of the conversations are jim how can you take our data along with all this industry data and how can you turn this into predictive analytics how can you turn this into actionable intelligence that will help us make better decisions on number one whats the best channel to sell the car in whats the best market to sell the vehicle and then what price should i be getting for the car all those things and this is really what drivin brings to the table now we were building a data science team here doing a very good job of building a data science team and attracting some really good talent but we knew if we continued to build that it was going to take perhaps two to three years to build out that team and attracting the data scientists and the phds that we would require and i kind of would go back and compare it to what we did with openlane when we bought openlane in  we had the opportunity to try and build this service or buy this service we bought openlane and everybody knows what a great decision that turned to be and this is kind of similar here do we build it or do we go out and acquire it we went out and we acquired it and we think it really accelerates the pace because these customers dont have two to three years to wait for the pricing models and the pricing engines that were going to build for them they need it today and so really what were going to do and i believe i mentioned in my commentary is were going to bring that drivin team and were going merge it with our data science team that weve been building here at adesa or at kar and i can tell you were now going to the market were ready to go to the market almost immediately were in discussions with some of our major customers on building these pricing engines and were talking about rolling out pilots here as early as the second quarter of the year so this ship is sailing and we dont want to miss the opportunity bob j labick  cjs securities inc got it and so in terms of if its not primarily transaction based its subscription based or how does the revenue model work eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc bob the revenue model – the interesting part the revenue model will vary based upon the customer but we will generally realize the value through the transactions but not the transactions of drivin the transactions of adesa bob j labick  cjs securities inc okay great thank you eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc youre welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of gary prestopino with barrington research your line is now open gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc hey good morning everyone james p hallett  kar auction services inc good morning gary eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc hey gary gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc couple of questions number one eric what gives you the confidence that in the back half of the year the reserves at afc are going to decline relative to the first two quarters eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc so gary whats interesting is you have visibility into what the performance of new loans is doing and weve already seen improvement in the portfolio for loans made in the last  days so again we have visibility into actual transactions and the things that are causing the writeoffs and the bad debt now are cars that were perhaps put on the floor plan and current at the end of last year that arent selling and you start to get the age of the vehicle and things like that so we have all of that information thats what gives us the confidence its real data on the actual loans that are outstanding it is little harder to look into q but we already have visibility into things that weve loaned on now whats again the payoff rate et cetera because if its not paid off now those will start to become issues in q gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay so some of the steps that you outlined i think in the q call as far as future lending are starting to take hold and youre just doing a better job of it eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc right i think we always did a great job of lending the money what weve done is focused on what part of the market do we have the least risk and its actually the lower end of the market and as we mentioned in the yearend call its really these large balances that have caused the issue in the last couple of quarters and deemphasizing that and not taking as much exposure into that part of the market is paying off for us gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay and then the choppiness that you saw in the independent dealer market in q attributed to some of these tax refunds not coming through in february does that portend that coming out of q you were still seeing the independent dealer market was still showing some strength and then that would translate into a better environment for the auction business itself james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah gary i think that we would expect that there will be continued increase in kind of whats taken place as we now get these tax refunds coming through we would expect that independent market to pick up a little bit gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay so it wasnt to have anything to do with the fact of extension of credit to the independent dealers for selling cars it was just – a lot of it how had do with that tax issue james p hallett  kar auction services inc yeah i think what happened is independent dealers got caught holding some inventory and they werent able to move their inventory which kind of choked them a little bit and their only release was to either take that car back to the wholesale market and be forced with perhaps some potential losses or holding the vehicles and i think theyve had to some vehicles and now theyve got to work their way through vehicles that were maybe bought at a little bit of a higher price in the previous market that they now have to liquidate in the current market eric m loughmiller  kar auction services inc and gary id like to remind you what jim said with a strong january and strong march the inventory they bought in january didnt sell at the same pace that they expected thats what slows it down they sell the cars march picks up again gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay thanks then lastly on drivin who is the end customer i mean i went to their website i looked at it it looked like a specialized almost search engine for dealertodealer transactions and from what youre talking about it seems that youre going to more or less emphasize the data versus the dealertodealer transactions so who is the end customer is it your consigners it that the dealers how does this all work and then the other question would be where are they getting the data from or where would you get the data from are there direct connects into the dealers vms system james p hallett  kar auction services inc okay so there is a lot there gary but let me try and get that for you first of all understand that i did say that drivin has a platform where they can transact and what i was referring to there is were servicing both the sellers and the buyers in terms of matching vehicles drivin has the ability to be able to know and understand a dealers inventory what inventory he buys what inventory he sells and to be able to match the inventory needs with the inventory that is being offered so there is that capability where we serve the buyer and the seller but then from the data standpoint the data is really focused on helping these major commercial consigners i think about the oems and the captive finance and the fleets and the rental companies and that whole commercial segment is helping them better understand the pricing of their vehicles and then when you move the vehicle through the system there is usually a reason why the vehicle doesnt sell in a close environment and its either price or condition so when that vehicle comes from a closed environment to the open environment there has to be – there should be a price adjustment there there should be a price adjustment unless its just purely condition but so its helping them understand how to price that vehicle in the open market and then if it doesnt sell in the open market then i mentioned to you theres an opportunity to reprice that car and put it on traderev because you would go through all these channels to avoid maybe the transportation costs and the days to sell the depreciation cost of actually sending it to a physical auction so its helping these customers make better upstream decisions before they decided to finally send it to a physical auction and this is where this data is really going to help them and as i said ive sat in on a number of presentations and the discussions are very much heading in a direction where customers are really saying think we need this help gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay thank you james p hallett  kar auction services inc thank you operator thank you and that does conclude todays questionandanswer session id now like to turn the call back to chief executive officer mr jim hallett for closing remarks james p hallett  kar auction services inc thank you chelsea and maybe i can just take a moment here and wrap up today with a few additional comments is first and foremost i want to thank you for being on the call and i want to thank you for the interest that you continue to take in our company one of the things that i look back on is – as i look back on my career over  years in the retail car business over  years in the auction business and ive seen a lot of change and priding myself as an entrepreneur i very much welcome change and i embrace change but i will tell you ive never seen change at the pace of change that were seeing in the current market the customers expectations their pain points the areas in which they need help and require help and the services that they need is accelerated beyond anything ive ever seen in my career but the good news about that is i feel that we kar have never been in a better position to provide that service and to deal with this rate of change as were positioned to today if i can if you think about it just for a moment we came together in  and we got off to a great start and then along came the recession were working our way through the recession we acquired openlane in a down market at a critical time and we all know how that worked out and then we went into the recovery in  and we continued to focus on acquiring businesses that will continue to improve our customers experience help their economic outcome and take this company and transform it to another level and just quickly we focused on technology and we focused on brick and mortar we acquired traderev we acquired drivin autoniq we acquired datascan we acquired carsarrive rdn and there is probably some that im leaving out there and then we acquired brick and mortar last year youve seen us acquire  brick and mortar auctions and then we invested in our existing platforms and we brought new benefits and features and enhancements and with all of that weve built a great company and we have positioned ourselves very well i would tell you in  we may have been seen as a bit of a laggard i can tell you today i couldnt be more proud of this management team and what weve been able to accomplish and i see kar very very much as a leader in this industry in all aspects of this industry and now we have great visibility into  and we know whats coming at us and i would tell you i am more confident and more enthusiastic and more energetic as to how were prepared for whats next so with that ill say thank you and we look forward to bringing you more good news have a good day operator ladies and gentlemen thank for participating in todays conference this does conclude the program and you may

release that we issued yesterday which is also available in the investor relations section of our website now id like to turn this call over to kar auction services ceo jim hallett jim james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer great thank you michael and good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our call today id like to provide you with an outlook for the year review our first quarter performance and then discuss our capital allocation activities including our expectations for the remainder of  we had a very strong first quarter and what were seeing has caused us to update our guidance after only one quarter we entered  with a very positive view on our expected performance and were pleased that we have already exceeded our expectations we continue to see very positive fundamentals that will continue through the remainder of the year retail new and used car activity continued to be relatively strong and the industry supply of commercial vehicles especially the offlease and the repossession units will continue to grow throughout  used car values are declining at a moderate pace so what does all this mean for kar at adesa we expect that we will exceed the volumes through  over last year onlineonly is likely to grow at a greater pace than the physical auction volumes even not at same level as we saw in the first quarter and the increased supply of offlease and repo volumes should continue to support the increased volumes at physical auction we believe the strong revenue per unit or the arpu will continue as we see our consigners spending money on the vehicles to improve the condition so the buyer can quickly retail the car this is also important for maximizing the residual lease returns as well we do face some headwinds especially at insurance auto auctions we continue to deal with currency and scrap prices however these headwinds are consistent with the expectations that we set during our guidance earlier in  the net of all of this is that we are increasing our guidance of adjusted ebitda we expect adjusted ebitda of  million to  million this will include approximately  million from the brasher acquisition and our free cash flow guidance remains the same as before the improved operating performance is offset by an increase in cash interest expense and free cash flow is expected to be approximately  million to  million for  i will let eric cover more details of the refinancing which drove our increase in cash interest expense for the year all in all our outlook for  remains positive and the year is shaping up to be better than what we originally expected now let me highlight our strong first quarter performance on a consolidated basis weve seen our revenue grow  over last year adjusted ebitda is up  and our operating adjusted eps is up  and obviously this is a great way for us to start  adesa is driving our strong performance during the first quarter where were seeing revenue up  over the prior year and  on a samestore basis volumes grew in onlineonly as well as at the physical auction our onlineonly was up  our physical auction volume was up  and im very pleased to report that this also includes a  increase in our dealer consignment volumes yearoveryear arpu was up in both channels as well onlineonly arpu was up  to  per unit and physical auction arpu was up  to  per unit were seeing strong revenue growth from transportation services and repossessionrelated activity as well were seeing an increase in utilization of ancillary services such as reconditioning and mechanical adesas adjusted ebitda grew  over the prior year  on a samestore basis and afc is also benefiting from the strong wholesale used car activity revenue grew on a  increase in loan transactions average loan values are increasing and we did see more bad debt in the first quarter than last year the increase in bad debt expense was right in line with our expectation for the first quarter and i think its important to point out that the portfolio has grown  over the past year as mentioned earlier insurance auto auctions continued to face challenges in proceeds scrap and foreign currency negatively impact the amount bid on salvage vehicles however the volume is more than offsetting this pressure and our ability to withstand these challenges demonstrates the value of our diversified business model and this is really what eric and i had been talking to you about for several years is really the strength of our business and the strength of our business model is how complementary these businesses are to one another and its really as i say a beautiful thing so the pressure that were seeing at iaa is offset by the strong performance in the other parts of our business inventory is up  over the prior year at march  this is a lower increase than we have reported for many quarters and i believe theres a couple of things here that i would mention number one i think it reflects on the mild winter conditions and the other point i would make is were seeing improved cycle times especially with one of our largest insurance companies and as you know these improved cycle times benefit our consigners as they say time is money with that said despite our strong performance i know that we need to continue focusing on sga and going back to the call in the previous quarter i mentioned that we were getting laserfocused on sga weve seen sga was up almost  million over the prior year about  million of this increase relates to acquired sga and the timing of expenses for cost of our medical plan and accruals for annual bonuses the rest of this increase relates to increases in our technology cost people and other expenses required to support the growth in our businesses our management team is focused on controlling sga we also realized that we need to support the growth in our businesses with the resources so this is really a balancing act the key is maintaining sga at a level that allows us to increase our adjusted ebitda margin in terms of capital allocation i think everybody is aware that we closed the brashers deal on april  this is a deal that we paid  million for eight auction locations we are very excited about adding the brasher family to the adesa organization this truly represents or i should say this truly strengthens our presence in the northwest united states where we were previously unrepresented so with that we have also announced plans to purchase an auction in orlando florida we have been focused on strengthening our presence in the key florida markets and as you probably know orlando is a very strong commercial market and we expect to close this transaction in the next few weeks we also announced the payment of our quarterly dividend at  per share and we will continue to return capital to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend we will also evaluate all of our capital needs and utilize share repurchases as we see appropriate i dont believe that we are done allocating capital to expanding our businesses we are in active discussions with a number of targets and at the right price if these deals can make sense to us we would certainly look to move forward on doing more acquisitions there is no assurance that we will get any of them to the finish line in the nearterm but i do like the way our discussions are progressing and with that let me finish up my comments with an update on adesa chicago construction is on target for opening in the third quarter the customer reaction has been very very positive and i would say to you as i mentioned before chicago is the third or fourth largest car market in the united states were moving into a major market thats been a big gap for us at what i would call a real opportune time as we are in the middle of the cyclical recovery i couldnt think of a better time to be opening this location in chicago so were excited with that so ill now turn the call over to eric for some additional comments and then well come back to you for qa eric eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you jim i would like to start my comments with a summary of our refinancing of longterm debt that was completed in march on march   we completed the refinancing of our term loan b and revolving credit agreement we issued  billion in term loan b at an interest rate of libor plus  basis points with a libor floor of  basis points term loan b matures in march  we also established a  million revolving credit facility with interest at libor plus  basis points that matures in march  the proceeds of term loan b were used to repay the outstanding balance on term loan b and amounts outstanding on our old revolving credit facility in addition funds from this financing were used for the purchase of brashers auctions for  million that closed on april  as a result of the issuance of term loan b we repriced the outstanding debt on term loan b to libor plus  basis points from libor plus  basis points both the old and new interest rates have a libor floor of  basis points term loan b has a maturity date of march  as a result of this refinancing activity we have updated our guidance on cash interest expense for  to approximately  million from  million in addition we wrote off  million in unamortized debt issuance costs in the first quarter we have capitalized original issue discount and debt issuance costs incurred in the refinancing and this will increase our noncash interest expense going forward which i have reflected in our updated guidance now i would like to clarify a couple of items impacting our financial results for the first quarter i will start with adesa as you saw in our earnings slides released last night we have provided detail on the incremental operating profit margin for adesa the difference between adjusted ebitda for acquisitions in the last  months of  million and operating profit of  million as disclosed in the earnings slides is depreciation and amortization of  million excluding acquisitions incremental margins for adesa in the first quarter were  on an adjusted ebitda basis this is computed as the increase in adjusted ebitda excluding acquisitions divided by the increase in revenue excluding acquisitions for the quarter in the onlineonly channel we have enhanced our disclosures after seeing the growing impact of the adesa assurance program the adesa assurance program allows any vehicle purchased in the onlineonly open venue to be returned within  days no questions asked we have a very small number of vehicles returned under this program but we found the impact on arpu to be more significant like purchased vehicles upon resale of these cars online we recognize the gross auction price as revenue instead of the net fees excluding cars sold after being returned under the adesa assurance program arpu for the onlineonly vehicles increased to  per unit in the first quarter from  per unit in the prior year now let me speak to the impact of hbc our uk salvage business on the insurance auto auctions margins in the first quarter substantially all of the salvage vehicles sold by hbc are purchased vehicles the impact of including hbc within our salvage segment is a reduction in the gross profit of  at afc we experienced increased bad debt expense in the first quarter as compared to the prior year  million of net bad debt expense up from  million last year was in line with our expectations for the quarter and reflects a level of losses we would expect going forward this level of bad debt is still at a run rate below  of average portfolio balance for the year we have projected capital expenditures for  of  million in the first quarter we expended  million including  million for adesa chicago as you may recall we estimated approximately  million in capital expenditures will be incurred in  for adesa chicago we expect the pace of spend to increase as the weather improves and we are anticipating an opening in the third quarter of this year in terms of guidance other than adjusted ebitda and free cash flow that jim spoke to i would like to highlight that our gaap net income per share guidance has been reduced to  to  operating adjusted net income per share guidance has been reduced to  to  these adjustments to our guidance reflect the impact of our refinancing including noncash interest expense which is offset by the increase in our expectations for adjusted ebitda for the year we have seen recent improvement in the canadian dollar versus the us dollar but this is still within the range of our expectations in our initial guidance we have made no adjustments in our expectations related to changes in the canadian dollar at this time i will now return the call to tony our operator so we can handle your questions thank you questionandanswer session operator great thank you first well move to ryan brinkman with jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning congrats on the quarter james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer thank you ryan eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks ryan ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc so obviously adesa was great from both a volume and arpu perspective there was expectation volume to track higher maybe not quite as high as it did but obviously its been strong for a while from my conversations the arpu was a big surprise though can you walk us through in a little bit greater detail about the headwinds and the tailwinds to adesa arpu maybe you can help us sort of gauge the magnitude of the impact to arpu from say lower used car prices and then we know that arpu increases from ancillary services just as more fuel cars fall further down into the funnel but is there also this like paradoxically this tailwind where the lower used car prices go people want to do more ancillary services to preserve residuals how to think about that james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah ryan i think youve got – first of all what you got is youve got sellers wanting to maximize the resale price getting the most money they can for the vehicle and so theyre doing more and more work to achieve better results financial results from the car the second thing is they want to convert at a higher rate they want to get more of these vehicles sold the first time through the auction and the best way to assure that they can get these vehicles sold the first time through the auction is to do more work to them and the third thing that many of these manufacturers are focused on is theyre focused on residual values and keeping those residual values as high as they can going forward with additional leasing so all in all we are seeing increased utilization and its really a question of how do i make my car stand taller how do i separate my car from the pack and attract more buyers to my lane versus the lane beside me so its a combination of all those things i think that has really driven the revenue here and i think that the opportunity continues as we see more and more of these leased cars coming and more of these leased cars and repossessed vehicles making their way to the physical auctions we feel that there is opportunity to continue to grow those ancillary services eric eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president and id add to that the mix of vehicles is important with more commercial vehicles when you look at that denominator its more cars that are using these services than where theres a heavier dealer consignment and this quarter were at  dealer consignment versus  commercial which is a strong shift from that  and so were selling more transportation and its profitable transportation because outbound transportation has profit and were seeing more activity on the repo side bringing those cars in through our par and rdn businesses and things like that so all of that adds up to what jim was summarizing there ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thats helpful and then to just kind of follow up on the adesa volume side then with the big increase have you started to think about when growth is inevitably going to kind of normalize lower if we look at the yearoveryear increases in lease originations it looks like the peak increase was in  is that what you see and then i know you dont guide to  obviously but off lease – and its going to grow clearly through  but is it also fair to say that it peaks this year and then just on a related note so the potential for modest increase is kind of beyond  not like were seeing now but it looks like lease penetration has gone from like  at the start of  to   now what do you think is driving that and do you care to guess how high it could potentially go james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer well ill start with your leasing question on the leasing part i think it comes back to the fact that people can afford half a car more than they can the full car and leasing is really being able to drive a new car and your payment – and its really matching your payment so theres just more of an attraction to leasing in the fact that you get to turn the car over every three to four years i think is still part of the american culture in terms of eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president in terms of the peak the largest increase might have been from  to  but were looking at least  million additional lease originations each year going   and now  is looking like its on the same path wouldnt you say jim james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer right eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president so when you say peak maybe the largest yearoveryear increase in lease originations might occur from  to  but there is strong growth thats continuing as you say into  where were seeing   lease origination rates james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i really dont think – truthful answer is i really dont think we know we do have what we would term as very good visibility for the next few years but getting beyond that i think we just have to wait and see it play out ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then last question is on onlineonly arpu i heard jim in the prepared remarks say – i think you said it was up like  something like that when you think about – when growth in onlineonly was preventing the incremental volume from flowing through to physical which is no longer the case i remember you were asked on these calls if there is anything you could do to help get increased fees from onlineonly and your response then was kind of like were trying but its really really hard so im just curious how youre able to take up that onlineonly arpu and what the outlook for that is maybe going forward james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer i think ryan the biggest opportunity there has been what weve been able to do in the open sale when that car goes from close to open then were able to expose that vehicle to a whole new buyer base beyond the franchise dealers and i think thats where were able to increase our fees as you know the economics get much much better in the open sale and thats where weve been able to increase the average fee or the average revenue per car on those online sales eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president and then with that said ryan id like everyone to know in  when we acquired openlane we had a plan as to what we could do in the onlineonly space i would say we are attaining those goals if not even exceeding those goals even with all of these close sales i mean this has been a great differentiator for our business and a great performer ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator great thank you next well move to matt fassler with goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co thanks a lot and good morning james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer good morning matt matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co its a terrific quarter obviously james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer thank you matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co first question on asp and arpu can you talk about the degree to which underlying pricing is changing in any way to help drive that number and then also eric related to that if you could – i appreciate the enhanced disclosure if you could just repeat precisely which numbers are impacted by the returned vehicles and so what the reported number is and what the adjusted number is just so we can get the right context eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay on the average selling price i think youre seeing whats being published youre seeing call it  or so declines in the average selling price but when you think about what that does – jim mentioned it what that does to the consignor who is trying to optimize if not maximize residuals theyre going to spend money on the car and we see that matt so thats the answer to that on the onlineonly and the adesa assurance program thank you i can repeat that and youll see it in the q that we file tonight we reported  per car sold compared to  in the prior year and when i take out the adesa assurance program and ill give you an example thats directionally correct that number should be  because on a car that we purchase – we repurchase under our assurance and then resell theres no real economic value to that transaction were just making good on our promise that  compared to  if i excluded the past year by giving you that  number and the number of units we sold you can calculate the value of the adesa assurance program and when you consider most of those are offlease cars lets hypothetically use a value of  per car that means that  cars sold is all in the quarter thats how small the number of cars is yet it had a  influence thats all things youll get out its in our earnings supplement matt but thats what i was calling out because i felt you might reach the wrong impression on the growth in arpu there when these  out of what  cars or whatever the number was let me look it up i should give you the right number it was a distortion that i felt we needed to clarify matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co got it and also just rephrasing the first part of the question on your fees per se has there been any change in your pricing or your fee structure of late that would help explain the asp acceleration or is it really more about mix in the ancillary services that are being added to the package james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yes matt i think its a little bit of both primarily i would say focused on the ancillary services and the things that are going on there but as ive always said at adesa more so we continuously are monitoring the buying fees and these are nationwide increases these sometimes can be regional increases or local increases and there have been some of those go in place probably in the first quarter but again i would take you back to – i would focus on the increase in ancillary services more so matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co great and then just one followup from that so your reported gross margin in adesa was up i believe  basis points its the first increase of anything in that magnitude youve had in at least two years maybe more and youve had other quarters where your volume growth has come close to this so was that really an outgrowth of that – of pricing in the average revenue per vehicle or is there something else on the cost side which i know you alluded to is that whats contributing to the better flowthrough at the gross profit line eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president matt as we look at it the gross profit is coming really i think through the mix of vehicles getting us that leverage in the use of the shops and its from the ancillary services also you look at things like par and our repossession activity again very good utilization while that might be a lower margin business it has a lot of scale in it and were getting the activity so its more the scale with a little bit coming from the auction fees margin that would be slightly up but not account for a significant portion of that  basis points matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co got it understood and appreciate it thank you james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer thank you matt operator great thank you next well move to gary prestopino with barrington research please go ahead your line is open gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc yeah a couple of questions first of all if chicago starts rolling out this year how long would a new site like that be a drag on the adjusted ebitda results james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer gary typically we would tell you for a greenfield location to be cash flow positive we normally look at it in a period of  months to  months in the case of las vegas which was the last one that we did were very pleased that were cash flow positive there in the first  months and let me say im optimistic that we can have strong results going into that chicago market i think were going in at a very good time we absolutely got the ideal location the buyer base is there the cars are there the customers are there im expecting a strong performance there coming out of the gate eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president and gary let me add when we say negative ebitda initially its not going to be a material number its not something that we expect to be calling out as an influence on our performance its just not a big contributor gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay just was curious there and then just an industry question in terms of the cars coming through lease or from lease returns are you seeing less of an appetite for the grounding dealers to take these cars initially theyre flowing through the pipe and then going more towards the independent dealers versus the franchise dealers is there a shift thats starting to occur here because the franchise dealers have ample inventory of used cars now james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer i think gary theres – first of all the grounding dealer the residuals are maybe a little bit higher than market value so youre seeing the grounding dealer pass on some of these cars at termination and then when theyre getting into as we call the top of the funnel in the closed sale there is a lot more vehicles to choose from so the dealers can be more selective and then theres more cars going through the online open sale which then brings in a whole new buyer base it brings in all those independents and youve already said it but just to reinforce what you said youve now got all those independents that are able to acquire some of this inventory as well so its a combination of all those things and primarily all being driven by the residual value at termination gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay and then just the last question on the loan loss reserve increase which is understandable because of the growth in the portfolio but it is my understanding that really you would have a huge loss if there was some kind of an outright fraud at the dealership where the car was domiciled where they bought it from you is the increase in the loss reserve really a function over the time from when it was bought to what the market value is now and youve got to write down that loan eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes gary we actually – writing off the loan actually this occurs so quickly given the nature of a floorplan lending business but most of the losses are lost value in the vehicle where we feel we cant recover from other assets but the most significant individual losses are what we call sold out of trust the car is sold the proceeds are received by the dealer and theyre not remitted for payment on the loan and theres no collateral for us to act upon as you would suspect even in declining values that loss would be relatively minor if we could repossess the car but if the car is in the possession of a consumer consumer protection laws prohibit us from repossessing from the consumer even though we may have held title as collateral so again the losses you see are heavily weighted by the car sold out of trust gary frank prestopino  barrington research associates inc okay thank you james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator great thank you next well move to tony cristello with bbt capital markets please go ahead your line is open anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets thank you good morning james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer good morning tony eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi tony anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets the first question is sort of a bigger picture question we continue to hear about more technology in the industry dealers looking for ways to speed up the process of auction andor move vehicles from dealer to dealer and in some instances bypassing auctions and i know youve got traderev and some other initiatives im wondering if you could expand on how you will take advantage of a shift perhaps in technology and be able to continue to better balance both the physical and online use of where things may evolve james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think were very much aware of potential disruption and how we could be disrupted and i would like to tell you that if theres disruption thats going to occur wed like to be disrupting ourselves and thats exactly what were planning – what our plans are with traderev we actually feel like we are disrupting ourselves there so that – traderev continues to rollout and we continue to add resources in the markets that we are in with traderev we are experiencing what i would call success were seeing the numbers continue to grow on a monthly basis weve brought in – weve enhanced some of our technology with other products weve talked about autoniq which gives the dealer real values on his smartphone while hes in the lane i think its being aware of what the technologies are that can really add value to the customers both on sell side and on the buy side and allowing them to make better decisions i think some of the things that were doing with data and planning on doing with data in terms of big picture will give the buyers and sellers better information to be able to make more informed decisions so eric do you want add something eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i mean like our investment in photo booths allows you to look at an image and you might buy that car online instead of waiting until it gets to – all of this – better inspection reports and enhancing the technology around checkin processes its all about taking time out of the process so the car can be sold quickly james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah and the other thing that i mentioned in my commentary that ill go back to is we talked about the cycle times at insurance auto auctions and cycle time is money and i think people are aware that the average cycle time historically at the salvage business has been in that day to day range and we have a new product that were offering at insurance auto auctions called total loss solutions that were introducing to some of our customers and its a product that we can scale across some of our customers that potentially can reduce cycle times and im talking about potentially reducing cycle time significantly by  days – by  days  days that becomes a very meaningful number anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets and i guess it seems like so from the technology part on adesa youre sort of being part of that evolution of change with iaa it sounds like youre being able to help improve what the insurance company see as probably one of their bigger expenses and so on that cycle time – or if you look at where the biggest opportunities are to communicating with the dmvs and improving that is it being more efficient at that first notice of loss point and are you able to see opportunities for yourself to continue to improve and obviously offer better services to your customers james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer i think its a little bit of all that youve mentioned really you think about the technology you think about the enhancements to our existing technology bringing in new technologies that weve talked about bringing in the data and the analytics and other things that we may be doing and working on i think if you – its kind of that story a little bit plus a little bit plus a little bit adds up to a lot and its just being very focused on whats going on in their industry and what the trends are and what the shifts are and making sure that were staying ahead of the curve eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president and tony using automation the key is you can track it its not sitting on somebodys desk for five days waiting its in a queue that someone says this is ready for the next step and whether that be again at the reconditioning shop or the mechanic shop right its everything not just paper its everything anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets okay thats great appreciate your time james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator great thank you and next well move to craig kennison with baird please go ahead your line is open craig r kennison  robert w baird  co inc broker great thank you for taking my question its really on this recall trend i think autonation recently announced a change to its recall policy and may end up ultimately wholesaling more vehicles if they can get the repair done in a timely fashion if that goes mainstream does that have any influence on your volume trends james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer well perhaps it could increase our volume overall if they start wholesaling more of those vehicles but i think that we would probably be required to get those recalls done before the vehicle got resold craig r kennison  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thank you james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from ali faghri with crt capital please go ahead your line is open ali faghri  crt capital group llc good morning thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer thank you ali faghri  crt capital group llc so total physical auction volumes were up  and dealer consignment was up  i think that implies commercial was up roughly  to  in the quarter which is a nice acceleration from lowsingle digits last quarter can you give us some color on what drove that specifically was that offlease repo or maybe timing and then also maybe some color on the cadence of volume trends at adesa throughout the quarter james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah there is no question on the commercial is – theres just more and more volume coming theres – these leases are continuing to come and the question ive answered earlier the grounding dealers passing on these cars and putting more vehicles into the funnel and then with the financial institutions those are writing more and more consumer credit and thats just a straight math calculation the more paper written the more repos youre going to have if i go back in history we peaked at about  million repos back in   and we took that number down to  million now were seeing those repossessions climb back up to that  million  million and i would expect that number will continue to grow as they continue to write more and more paper so the heavy influence has been with the commercial cars – theres no question and then i think that on the dealer consignment im extremely proud of what our adesa organization has done with dealer consignment and that was really an initiative that many of you are familiar with it started back in  and when we put that whole network in place we have  people in the field approximately that are very focused on calling on dealers one at a time we had people calling on the midsized groups and the large dealer groups and weve just really created some good habits for our dealers and weve started to treat the dealer consignment business more like we treat the commercial business providing more and more services to them and i think the proof is in the pudding were getting the results and our dealers are all about results and that they have a good experience theyre returning and i think that dealer consignment team again has just done a remarkable job and quite frankly eric and i have been saying this for probably the last two years or three years is we are surprised that the dealer consignment numbers have held up as strong as they have when you consider the impact of all of these commercial vehicles coming back so its really been a great win for us eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president and let me clarify i think youll find the commercial volumes were up much more than  to  if  of the physical auction volumes were up  the other  were up by a greater amount ali we can walk you through that at a later time but youll get a much higher number than the  to  ali faghri  crt capital group llc great and then just on the cadence of volume trends as well throughout the quarter james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer i think its been steady there was again eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president id say it followed our seasonal pattern january was january because of the slow start to the year and got very strong in march because thats when the lease returns really pick up ali faghri  crt capital group llc great thank you operator thank you next james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer sorry go ahead operator oh thank you next well move to bret jordan from jefferies please go ahead your line is open bret jordan  jefferies llc hi good morning guys james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer good morning bret bret jordan  jefferies llc a question on the iaa inventory up  you talked about improved cycle times was there any impact from generally warmer and less icy weather in the northern or northeastern states and then again some volume shift with farmers in the quarter or is it primarily just the cycle times james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah bret id mention that there certainly were some impact from the mild winter that we experienced in terms of customers we really dont get into talking about specific customers but you have your wins and your losses and they pretty much offset each other but maybe the bigger impact was improving these cycle times and as i mentioned in my commentary especially with one very large customer that we mentioned previously that they had kind of taken a pause and they kind of taken the time out to restructure a lot of their internal processes and now that theyve got those restructured and theyre working with us in our total loss solutions now in terms of how they cycle these vehicles to the market that has reduced inventory at the end of the quarter eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president let me clarify one thing they are utilizing the expertise of total loss solutions we are not processing titles for them bret jordan  jefferies llc okay okay and a housekeeping question on sga you said  million of the incremental  million was acquired how much of that was brashers eight how do you see brashers adding to sga on the year eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president brashers is not in our numbers bret jordan  jefferies llc okay eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president they were acquired april st so they dont even hit for one day bret but brashers again well give more color on that we just closed the transaction it will – its got a business that looks very much like the adesa business with about  –  or  ebitda margins coming in and its a local operation itll fit very nicely in the business model of adesa james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer and the other thing that i would just add is very similar mix to what you see at adesa as well between commercial and dealer bret jordan  jefferies llc okay great thank you james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator thank you next well move to ben bienvenu from stephens please go ahead your line is open benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc thanks good morning guys james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer good morning eric m loughmiller  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi ben benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc touching on the salvage business your acquisition that you made in the uk id just be curious to hear the progress there how discussions with insurance companies are going to the extent you can opine and then your thoughts on the broader market there as well james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer as it turned out our timing wasnt great when we did that acquisition i think as we said scrap prices couldnt go any lower than they were at the time that we were getting that acquisition closed and weve mentioned previously that we did go over and we sat with the management team we did kind of restructure the business model a little bit not in terms of the amount of cars bought but in terms of some of the pricing that was going on and as eric mentioned in his commentary were pleased that hbc was a positive contributor in the first quarter and we think weve got the business model right and we think we can continue to grow that and in terms of looking forward were a very very very distant number two player but we think there is opportunity to do further consolidation and well just have to stand by and see how that plays out benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc great and then your comments earlier around active discussions and deals should we think theres possible opportunities in both north america and abroad and then also adesa and iaa maybe give us a sense of what those opportunities look like by business segment james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah and i think you should think about all of our businesses and that were actively looking at opportunities and targets and you should think of them both domestically and internationally and as i mentioned in the past were still very much a believer in brick and mortar we believe brick and mortar still has a role to play here and we can buy these at what we would believe are very attractive multiples and as ive said previously theres  to  what i would consider really plumtype acquisitions out there not that were going to buy  to  thats not what im saying dont misunderstand that but im saying of those  to  we are in active discussions with a number of those and i would hope that we could possibly close on some additional independents with no time line in mind benjamin bienvenu  stephens inc fantastic best of luck going forward james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you next well move to bob labick with cjs securities please go ahead your line is open robert labick  cjs securities inc good morning james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer hi bob robert labick  cjs securities inc hi a lot of my questions have been answered but just according to some trade magazines traderev has moved into the washington dc area and i was wondering if you could just talk about your progress and your plans on rolling out in the us obviously it started in canada and stuff and just tell us how long you would expect this to take or how youre planning the rollout if theres a lot of capital that has to go behind it at all give us some more insight on to that please james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so a couple things first of all ill acknowledge the washington dc market we did have a press release announcing that traderev is now representing the pohanka group there i think its  stores and were managing – were selling i believe the majority or all of their vehicles all of their trade vehicles and overaged inventory on traderev so that was a big announcement for us weve also updated our technology on traderev weve come out with what we call traderev  thats been rolled out in both canada and the us weve added a number of resources here in the us in terms of people and its really one market at a time and its just getting to these markets in an organized manner and the markets that were in were experiencing success like the one you mentioned with pohanka pohanka is not the only deal but were experiencing success were building the buyer base and were building the seller base as well and again were seeing positive trends where the volume continues to reach new levels each month so were very pleased with traderev but i think the thing that i would remind you of is i do believe traderev has an opportunity to really be transformational in that dealertodealer space but i wouldnt want to suggest that this is going to be an overnight deal i think this is with a longer term vision i think about traderev as really being fully deployed and really hitting on all eight as they say probably over the course of what i would think the next three years to five years i think it has the opportunity to really transform that dealer space so with all that said were very pleased with what were seeing robert labick  cjs securities inc great appreciate that thank you very much james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer youre very welcome operator thank you and well take our final question in queue from bill armstrong from cl king  associates please go ahead your line is open william r armstrong  cl king  associates inc good morning gentlemen in insurance auto auctions looks like the declines in revenue per vehicle are getting less negative i was wondering if you could just discuss what youre seeing in terms of scrap pricing is that starting to become less of an issue and you were mentioning cycle time is reducing is that helping your revenue per vehicle in any way james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer bill as i said i dont think scrap prices can go any lower so anything is going to be an improvement and we are seeing a slight improvement in scrap prices also eric mentioned were seeing a slight improvement in currency as well and then – so yes that is helping mildly i would say very mildly at this point in time and certainly the improvement in the cycle time is just moving these cars to the system quicker william r armstrong  cl king  associates inc does that cycle time improvement really – does that help your revenue per vehicle or is it more maybe a help on the gross margin side james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer bill to the extent that they get a higher auction price because it didnt further depreciate there might be a slight tick up in the buy fee but that would be the only way youd see it william r armstrong  cl king  associates inc i see okay thank you james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer youre very welcome operator thank you and at this time id like to turn the conference back over to jim hallett for any closing comments or remarks james p hallett  chairman  chief executive officer thank you tony and ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for being on the call again we continue to appreciate your interest and your investment in our company obviously
