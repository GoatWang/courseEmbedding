to the harbinger defendants refer to all of the defendants identified in this paragraph ac  fund i fund ii and the special situations fund are also identified as nominal defendants in this action and plaintiffs bring derivative claims on their behalf ac  b factual background the court assumes familiarity with its order dismissing the fourth amended complaint from which the basic factual allegations are largely unchanged see dkt no  in re harbinger capital partners funds investor litig no cv ajn  wl  sdny sept   the harbinger funds first invested in skyterra in  when they purchased some of the companys debt along with small amounts of equity ac  over the next few years the harbingeraffiliated funds acquired an increasing amount of  skyterras debt and equity in  defendants entered into an agreement and plan of merger with the company pursuant to which they would acquire full ownership of skyterra and take the company private the merger was completed in march  and defendants then replaced nearly all of the companys officers and directors and renamed it lightsquared ac iii  lightsquared was a highspeed wireless broadband company that intended to operate on the lband satellite network on frequencies neighboring those used by global positioning system gps technology ac ii  in order to operate on the lband spectrum lightsquared needed approval from the federal communications commission fcc and in  the company then still skyterra was granted permission to build out but not to operate its network in january  the fcc conditionally approved lightsquareds plans to expand its initial bandwith license subject to resolving interference problems with gps operators and despite opposition from gps and military equipment producers the pentagon nasa and the department of transportation ac iii  after a february   national telecommunications information administration report to the fcc concluded that multiple tests showed that lightsquareds technology could not operate without interfering with the gps network the fcc revoked its conditional approval of lightsquareds network the next day ac iii  it was in the interim period between initial approval to build the network in  and the ultimate revocation of the conditional license in  that defendants made their investment in lightsquared plaintiffs also allege that some of lightsquared s favorable treatment was due to dubious attempts to curry favor such as donations to campaign committees job offers to members of the presidential transition team in  and pressure on witnesses testifying before congress ac iii  after lightsquared was granted the conditional waiver in january  defendant falcone and the company became the subjects of an investigation by the senate judiciary committee into whether the approval was the result of political contributions ac iii  plaintiff allege that this scrutiny has made lightsquared a political hot potato too controversial for lawmakers and regulators to touch ac ii   the fccs revocation of the conditional license put lightsquared on an inevitable path toward bankruptcy customers terminated contracts because of lightsquared s failure to gain fcc approval ac  and the company began to take on more debt to pay its existing obligations ac  despite initially suggesting that he would not consider bankruptcy ac  falcone later changed course and placed the company into bankruptcy on may   ac  shortly before doing so he expressed what plaintiffs allege is an apparent lack of concern about whether lightsquared would go bankrupt making statements that he would retain control of the company either way and that his lifestyle would not change ac  not long after the bankruptcy filing the sec completed an investigation of falcone and the harbinger family of funds partnerships and holding companies ac  falcone hcp and the special situations gp were charged in three civil fraud complaints and one administrative proceeding with multiple securities laws violations ac  the sec alleged among other things that falcone and hcp fraudulently gave falcone a  million personal loan from the special situations fund at an interest rate well below the market rate without revealing their actions to investors ac  furthermore the sec indicated that falcone and hcp reached side deals with some of their largest investors to give them preferential redemption terms for their investments as a quid pro quo for voting in favor of more restrictive terms for other investors ac  falcone and hcp eventually reached a settlement with the sec and signed a proposed final judgment admitting that they made the personal loan to falcone without disclosing it for five months and granted favorable redemption terms to investors in fund i exchange for investors votes to impose more restrictive terms without informing fund is board of directors or other investors ac  c procedural history the court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint on september   in relevant part the court dismissed with prejudice all of plaintiffs claims predicated on defendants purchase of skyterra dkt no  at  such dismissal was compelled by the securities litigation uniform standards act of   slusa  usc § bbt because plaintiffs claims involved allegations of misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security  usc § bbtla as explained in the september   order a suit is precluded by sl usa when  it is a covered class action with a class size of  or more people  it is based on state or local law  it concerns a covered security and  the defendant misrepresented or omitted a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of that security dkt no  at  citing newman v family mgmt corp  f supp d   sdny  the parties agreed that the first three requirements were met so only the in connection with a covered security requirement was at issue in the previous motion to dismiss a security covered under slusa is one traded nationally and listed on a national exchange merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc v dabit  us     usc § bbte the court rejected plaintiffs argument that their claims were not precluded by slusa because they invested only in the harbinger funds which are uncovered securities the court relied on the second circuits decision in in re herald herald i  fd  d cir  which held that slusa precluded claims brought by investors in uncovered feeder funds when those funds in turn had an investment strategy involving the purchase of covered securities and the investors claims arose in connection with the funds security fraud id at  recognizing that plaintiffs had also alleged claims that were not related to the skyterra acquisition such as those premised on falcones personal loan from the special situations fund and the undisclosed preferential redemption terms for certain institutional investors the court granted plaintiffs an opportunity to amend the complaint and replead those claims in a way that clearly separated them from allegations based on the acquisition of skyterra subsequent to the courts order the supreme court issued its decision in chadbourne  parke llp v troice  s ct   on february   troice held that a fraudulent misrepresentation or omission is not made in connection with  a purchase or sale of a covered security unless it is material to a decision by one or more individuals other than  the fraudster to buy or to sell a covered security id at  that case involved investors in certificates of deposit offered by stanford bank as part of allen stanfords ponzi scheme and the court held that claims alleging fraud related to that investment were not precluded by slusa because they were not made in connection with covered securities id at   the only potential connection between the fraud on investors and covered securities in troice was the banks purported use of the deposited funds to purchase covered securities the investors themselves had no purported ownership interest in those securities id at  plaintiffs here moved for reconsideration of the courts september   order in light of troice arguing that troice overruled herald is conclusion that claims of fraud causing an investor to take an ownership interest in uncovered hedge fund securities could be considered in connection with the underlying covered securities purchased by the feeder fund see dkt no  the court heard oral arguments but delayed deciding plaintiffs motion until further guidance issued from the second circuit which came shortly thereafter in the form of in re herald herald ii  fd  d cir  cert denied sub nom davis v kohn no  us mar   in herald ii the second circuit denied a petition for panel rehearing in light of troice explaining that troice concerned investors who were not seeking directly or indirectly to purchase covered securities id at  they distinguished the funds in herald from the certificates of deposit in troice because the herald investors did in fact take a purported ownership interest in covered securities even though it was through feeder funds as an intermediary id after the second circuit decided herald ii the court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration on july   dkt no  recognizing that the second circuit had reaffirmed that claims based on both indirect and direct investments in covered securities are precluded the court found plaintiffs other attempts to distinguish herald ii unpersuasive defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss the sixth amended complaint shortly after the court issued the order denying reconsideration ii motion to dismiss legal standard  to survive a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b  a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations accepted as true to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face ashcroft v iqbal  us    quoting twombly  us at  internal quotation marks omitted at this stage a court must accept as true all wellpleaded facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to plaintiffs see kassner v nd ave delicatessen inc  fd   d cir  although factual allegations are therefore afforded a presumption of truth a court is not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation bell at corp v twombly  us    quoting papasan v allain  us    in addition to the allegations in the complaint the court may also consider documents attached to the complaint as an exhibit or incorporated in it by reference matters of which judicial notice may be taken or documents either in plaintiffs possession or of which plaintiffs had knowledge and relied on in bringing suit chambers v time warner inc  fd   d cir  quotation marks and alterations omitted quoting brass v am film techs inc  fd   d cir  iii slusa counts i  ii defendants first argue that counts i and ii of the sixth amended complaint which assert statelaw negligent misrepresentation and fraud claims against all defendants are precluded under slusa even in their amended form their argument in short is that their allegations of fraud and misrepresentations arising while lightsquared was a private uncovered security are inevitably intertwined with their allegations regarding the funds purchase of skyterraand thus that the alleged fraud was perpetrated in connection with with the purchase of covered skyterra securities following the courts dismissal of claims based on defendants purchase of skyterra in the september   memorandum  order dkt no  and the courts subsequent denial of their motion for reconsideration dkt no  plaintiffs have repleaded their allegations to allege only misrepresentations and fraudulent statements made by defendants after lightsquared went private these misrepresentations plaintiffs claim caused them to purchase or hold limited  partnership interests in harbinger funds that they either would have foregone or divested from had they known the truth the sixth amended complaint does not contain explicit allegations that misrepresentations were made before or during harbingers purchase of skyterra instead its allegations in the section entitled direct claims are largely limited to misrepresentations and failures to disclose in the time period after lightsquared went private in march  including  an investor conference call on april    portfolio updates on june  and    an investor presentation in june   a press release dated july    an investor update on november    an announcement that lightsqaured had reached an agreement with sprint nextel on june    an investor update on august    an investor update on august   which was the first to mention gps interference issues and  monthly statements about the funds performance that did not reflect lightsquareds correct value ac iii  the questions is whether plaintiffs more limited allegations involving lightsquared are unrelated to defendants acquisition of covered skyterra securities in a meaningful way or just a superficial one background allegations that are not factual predicates of a defendants liability do not themselves trigger slusa preclusion see lasala v border et cie  fd   d cir  accord in re herald herald i  fd   d cir  in other words allegations of misrepresentations and omissions related to covered securities will not trigger slusa preclusion if they are extraneous to the bases for liability alleged in the complaint lasala  fd at  however plaintiffs cannot avoid preclusion by artfully pleading their claims so as to seemingly disconnect them from the purchase or sale of a covered security if the distinction drawn is superficial courts are required to look beyond the face of the complaint to analyze the substance of the allegations made dabit v merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc  fd   d cir  rev don other grounds  us   accordingly if any sufficient connection between plaintiffs claims and the sale of a covered security exists based on the substance of the allegations the claims are precluded even if  plaintiffs do not plead that connection explicitly see herald i  fd at  connection can be implicit or explicit citing lasala  fd at  unlike troice and herald ii the question here is not whether investments made through an intermediary still involve the purchase or sale of a covered security but whether the entirety of a fraud involving a security that transitions from covered to uncovered status in medias res is precluded by slusa if lightsquared had been a publicly traded company throughout the entirety of the period covered by plaintiffs allegations it would be selfevident that they were precluded under herald ii and merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc v dabit  us    holding that claims of individuals defrauded into holding covered securities precluded under slusa but while the parties agree that shares of skyterra were a covered security at the time harbinger acquired them lightsquared equity shares would not considered in isolation be considered covered securities once the merger was complete and the company was taken private because they were not traded on a national exchange id at  though neither troice nor herald ii dealt with the temporal question at issue here those cases did set forth principles that guide this inquiry troice held that for slusa purposes a fraudulent misrepresentation or omission is not made in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security unless it is material to a decision by one or more individuals other than the fraudster to buy or sell a covered security  s ct at  internal quotation marks omitted inasmuch as troice emphasized the narrowness of slusa s definition of covered security however it also did not disturb the supreme comis prior holding in dabit which read slusa broadly to hold that preclusion does not depend on the plaintiffs being the direct purchasers of the covered security or the plaintiffs and the defendant being in a buyerseller relationship dabit  us at  the alleged fraud need only coincide with a securities transactionwhether by the plaintiff or by someone else id emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted between troice and dabit then the in connection with requirement can fairly be said to have both a narrow and a broad dimension it is narrow insofar as allegedly fraudulent statements must be of the type that would induce someone to buy or sell  or hold a covered security fraud that depends in no way on a purchase of covered securities will not suffice even if the fraudster purports to undertake independent transactions in covered securities on his own but once it is shown that the alleged fraud is comprised of statements or omissions that would lead an investor to make a decision about whether to buy or purchase covered securities the scope of what is precluded is broad and includes far more than claims that the plaintiffs themselves were induced to take a position in the covered security so long as someone was induced to buy sell or hold a covered security any fraud claim involving those transactions or foregone transactions is precluded under dabit in light of these principles and after considering not just the face of the sixth amended complaint but also the substance of its allegations as is required the court agrees with defendants that slusa precludes counts i and ii the sine qua non of plaintiffs allegations is that but for defendants misrepresentations and omissions plaintiffs would have divested themselves of skyterralightsquared by divesting from the funds on that score they plead a single fraud that caused them to purchase or hold their investmentsa fraud that began with material misstatements and omissions made in connection with the purchase of a covered security skyterra and continued with the same misrepresentations and omissions after skyterra became the privately held company lightsquared to carefully excise the allegations involving purchase and holding of interests in the harbinger funds during the acquisition of skyterra is artful pleading and does not mask plaintiffs effective allegations of a single fraud with the requisite connection to covered securities despite plaintiffs attempts to cabin their fraud allegations to events occurring after defendants took lightsquared private the sixth amended complaint is still replete with allegations concerning the acquisition of skyterra see ac iii  beginning with the initial investment in skyterra plaintiffs allege that defendants first invested in skyterras debt as would be appropriate for a fund marketed primarily as a distresseddebt fund ac il implying that the acquisition of skyterra equity was defendants first inappropriate move as it deviated from representations made to investors plaintiffs further allege that because  harbinger appointed two members to skyterras board after an initial round of equity investments defendants knew about skyterras severe financial problems before they acquired the company in full ac ii  these allegations match plaintiffs assertions under the heading direct claims defendants false and misleading statements to the investors wherein they explain that lightsquareds predecessors knew of the gps problems since  well before defendants takeprivate acquisition of skyterra ac ii  putting a finer point on the matter plaintiffs allege that it can reasonably be inferred that defendants would have become aware of the gps issue and the hurdles to obtaining fcc approval of the companys technology while performing due diligence in anticipation of their acquisition of the company ac ii  plaintiffs then go on to state that despite knowing of these enormous risks and hurdles  defendants provided plaintiffs and class members with positive anodyne general reporting on harbingers investment in lightsquared   ac ii  based on plaintiffs own allegations then defendants knew and did not disclose to plaintiffs and other investors even before they took skyterra private  that they had taken a large position in what became lightsquared despite contrary representations about the funds investment strategies  that skyterralightsquared faced serious technological and regulatory challenges that were likely to hinder its development and make the success of the venture speculative at best and  that defendants would be in a management role over skyterralightsquared these same general misstatements and omissions form the foundation of plaintiffs allegations from the period after defendants took lightsquared private see ac iiii  misleading investors about lightsquareds risks and compatibility with defendants investment strategy ac iiii  misleading investors about regulatory risks ac iiii  misleading investors about technological regulatory and management risks ac iiii  misleading investors about technology and risks ac iiii  misleading statements reaffirmed prior false statements about assets and business plans ac iiii  misleading  plaintiffs do not specify which specific harbinger entity they are referring to in this portion of the sixth amended complaint  statements and omissions regarding regulatory risk ac  misrepresentations regarding seriousness of regulatorytechnological issue even matters that could not have underlain allegations from before the company went private such as omissions in an announcement about a contract with sprint nextel ac  and defendants failure to properly mark down lightsquareds value when reporting it to investors ac  are simply the other side of the same coin they are misrepresentations about the value and risk involved in the overall investment in skyterralightsquared and are part of defendants alleged continuing efforts to keep plaintiffs in the dark about that investment it is telling that the sixth amended complaint alleges not a series of smaller frauds but a single fraudulent course of conduct that encompasses all of the misstatements and omissions that plaintiffs have alleged see ac  describing count i and alleging that defendants made numerous false and misleading representations about the funds to plaintiffs and class members concerning among other things the funds investment strategy the risk management strategies that would be employed and the prospects for the funds underlying investments  count ii also alleging numerous false representations the substance of the sixth amended complaint makes clear that it is arbitrary from the standpoint of evaluating the entire scheme to begin the allegations of fraud and misrepresentations at the moment lightsquared became private and that the only purpose for doing is to avoid slusas reach this is artful pleading and even the sixth amended complaint itself occasionally undermines it at one point in the complaint plaintiffs suggest that taking the company private was part of the overall fraudulent scheme see ac  in connection with its acquisition harbinger also took skyterra private so that it no longer had to file public reports all of the same misconduct that plaintiffs allege occurred after the company went private was also occurring when it was still publicly traded and plaintiffs cannot avoid that fact by deleting certain facts from the complaint or labeling others background the substance of the complaint reveals that defendants activities while skyterra was still public were factual predicates of the same fraud that plaintiffs have pleaded  further evidence of artful pleading is found in the differences between plaintiffs direct and derivative claims though counts i and ii disclaim including any allegations related to derivative claims the court is required look at the substance of plaintiffs allegations and the derivativeclaim allegations shed light on the overall nature of defendants scheme in those allegations plaintiffs discuss the lightsquared gamble and explain that defendant falcone was pursuing a vision of building a g wireless network ac  they claim that this vision involved deviating from the funds objective which is also an allegation underlying their direct claims ac  and throughout the sixth amended complaint plaintiffs refer to the acquisition of skyterralightsquared as a strategy undertaken by the funds with the implicit understanding that defendants became set on their course of conduct from the time they began acquiring skyterra equity see ac  in   defendants started to implement a very different investment strategy   referring to falcones  referring to the lightsquared strategy   harbingers misrepresentation and disclosure failures related to gps interference issues exacerbated its failures to disclose risks  including its adoption of a longterm strategy to execute on business plans rather than an eventdriven  defendants concealed the risk inherent in this strategy   as herald i and other cases discussing artful pleading have made clear the court cannot turn a blind eye to allegations that would connect defendants fraud to a covered security and the substance of the facts related to those allegations simply because plaintiffs ask the court to do so see herald i  fd at  accordingly because plaintiffs have not pleaded fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims that are unrelated to the purchase of covered skyterra securities their claims in counts i and ii of the sixth amended complaint are precluded under slusa and dismissed with prejudice iv direct breach of fiduciary duty  aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty counts iii  v  count three of the sixth amended complaint alleges that falcone harbinger gp harbinger special situations gp and harbinger special situations offshore gp breached fiduciary duties owed directly to plaintiffs as investors ac  specifically this claim is based on lowinterest  million loan defendant falcone received from the special situations fund as well as on undisclosed side letters signed with large institutional investors to allowed them to redeem their investments both at times when others were not permitted to make redemptions and on terms more favorable than those offered to other investors ac   defendants argue that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim on this count because the personal loan was disclosed to plaintiffs and because the possibility of investment terms being waived or modified for large or strategic investors was disclosed as part of the funds governing agreements which plaintiffs received prior to investing in the funds they further argue that falcone is not liable on this claim because he did not owe a fiduciary duty directly to investors though plaintiffs claim with regard to falcones  million loan is pleaded solely in terms of violating the fiduciary duty of disclosure their moving papers also indicate a theory that defendants violated the duty of loyalty however any theory plaintiffs advance that their direct claims for breach of fiduciary may go forward based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty must be put aside because such claims must be derivative not direct as the court explained in its memorandum  order on the motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint claims alleging fund mismanagement are indisputably derivative under delaware law dkt no  at  thus though defendants do not contest plaintiffs proposition that it is an act of disloyalty for a fiduciary to profit personally from use of partnership property oberly v kirby  ad   del  discussing use of information secured in a confidential relationship this claim is derivative because it alleges that falcone profited from use of the partnerships property the allegation is that falcone received the loan at an interest rate lower than what the special situations fund was paying to borrow moneymeaning the special situations fund was taking a loss on the loan ac  a  for the same reasons as were discussed in the courts september   memorandum  order a direct claim premised on this theory cannot stand that said the september   memorandum  order also explained that plaintiffs could raise a direct breach of fiduciary duty claim alleging nondisclosure of information see dkt no  at  the sixth amended complaint states that defendants owed duties of candor and truthful disclosure   ac ii  it goes on to state defendants knowingly andor grossly negligently failed to disclose to investors that falcone received a lowinterest personal loan   ac ii  emphasis added because these claims are facially premised on the duty of disclosure they are appropriately raised as direct claims and the court will consider them now as a threshold matter defendants argue that defendant falcone did not owe fiduciary duties directly to plaintiffs and other investors recall that special situations fund which was the source of the loan has special situations gp as its general partner special situations gp in turn is managed by harbinger capital holdings falcone is the managing member of holdings meaning that although he has operating control over the special situations fund his relationship to it is twice removed he is the managing partner of the managing partner of the general partner of the special situations fund see discussion supra at  defendants argument that falcone did not owe fiduciary duties to the limited partners of ie investors in the special situations fund is premised on the proposition that as a matter of delaware law the person or entity who controls the general partner of a limited partnership does not owe fiduciary duties to the partnership or its individual partners defs mem in support at  this assertion plainly fails in light of in re usacafes lp litigation  ad  del ch  which held that directors of a corporate general partner owe fiduciary duties directly to limited partners id at  without delineating the entire extent of the duty owed by a directors of a general partner who are in control of the partnerships property the court of chancery explained that it surely entails the duty not to use control over the partnerships property to advantage the corporate director at the expense of the partnership id at  this holding squarely covers plaintiffs  allegations concerning falcones loan from the special situations fund as he was the director in control of the partnerships property even if his control was formally mediated by a corporate general partner defendants acknowledge usacafes but argue that delaware law on the issue has changed even though usacafes has never been directly overruled even in the authority cited by defendants however the court of chancery notes that it has faithfully applied the holding of usacafes since it came down and that the case and its progeny are stare decisis feeley v nhaocg llc  ad   del ch  the court must apply delaware law and under delaware law falcone has fiduciary duties to limited partners in the special situations fund even so plaintiffs must adequately plead allegations that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiffs by failing to disclose information regarding the personal loan to falcone and the side letters to institutional investors defendants argue that the heightened pleading standard of federal rule of civil procedure b applies to these allegations and the court agrees

complaint fit that bill they allege that defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed directly to plaintiffs by failing to disclose information regarding falcones personal loan from the special situations fund and  the side arrangements with large institutional investors giving them preferential redemption terms and that plaintiffs were induced to hold their investments based on these omissions essentially defendants are alleged to have omitted giving this information to plaintiffs and thus defrauded them into remaining invested in the funds rule b requires that when alleging fraud or mistake a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake fed r civ p b in the securities fraud context this standard requires a plaintiff to   specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent  identify the speaker  state where and when the statements were made and  explain why the statements were fraudulent ats commcns inc v shaar fund ltd  fd   d cir  citing novak v kasaks  fd   d cir  the requirements for alleging omissions are substantially the same plaintiffs must specify the omissions that they contend were fraudulent identify the person responsible for not disclosing the omissions state where and when the omissions occurred and explain why the omissions were fraudulent see in re initial pub offering sec litig  f supp d   n sdny  plaintiffs response fails to adequately address defendants argument that the fraud is not alleged with sufficient particularity plaintiffs point the court to paragraphs  through  of the sixth amended complaint which they say contain the particular misstatements defendants have made all of these paragraphs relate to allegations involving the lightsquared investment and none touch on the personal loan or side arrangements however the court has considered the broader allegations in the sixth amended complaint for the purpose of evaluating whether they comply with rule b  plaintiffs allege that the sec charged falcone with fraudulently scheming to misappropriate  million from the funds by arranging for the personal loan and by concealing the loan from investors for five months ac if  the complaint contains further allegations stating that falcone and harbinger engaged outside counsel to advise on the loan but withheld information from them and ignored a warning from the general counsel of the funds thirdparty service provider advising against the loan ac if  plaintiffs state that  falcone and hcp never disclosed the loan to investors in the special situations fund and it was not listed as an asset despite being one of the funds largest holdings ac  they also allege that falcone sent an email to investors stating the loan had been vetted extensively as well as other misleading emails ac  finally after the loan was revealed in march  falcone and hcp told investors that falcones tax liability which is ostensibly why he took the loan was unexpected which plaintiffs claim was untrue ac  although the allegations that  falcone did not disclose the loan and  that he emailed investors to tell them it had been extensively vetted appear contradictory the court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and thus assume that the email was sent after the five months that defendants allegedly did not disclose the loan had passed these allegations fall short of rule b standards as far as falcones and hcps affirmative statements go there is no indication of where and when any of the statements attributed to defendants were made see ats commcns  fd at  the sixth amended complaint refers only to a representation that the loan was vetted extensively in an email that was sent at an unspecified time and under unspecified circumstances and refers to other misleading emails ac  these basic allegations are not sufficient see luce v edelstein  fd   d cir  allegations lacking information regarding time place speaker and content of misrepresentations insufficient under rule b it also alleges that falcone and hcp told investors that falcones tax liability was unexpected but there is no explanation as to why the statement was fraudulent ats commc ns  fd at  as for the alleged omissions plaintiffs allege broadly that defendant failed to disclose the loan to them for five months ac  their other allegations of malfeasance regarding the loan are not couched in terms of nondisclosure they allege that the loan was taken out at well below the interest rate falcone should have paid that falcone ignored counsels advice in taking the loan and that falcone failed to disclose matters to the law firm advising him on the loan ac  but do not allege that failing to disclose any of these matters was fraudulent they instead state that these allegations conferred a benefit to falcone at investors expense but the  allegations cannot plausibly be understood to suggest that this was because plaintiffs were misled as to any of these matters ac  plaintiffs do not state whether falcone harbinger or some other entity were responsible for informing them about the loan or exactly when the omissions occurred see in re initial pub offering  f supp d at  n indeed it is unclear from the sixth amended complaint the regularity with which statements about new investments or loans would or should have been made and thus there is no statement as to why failure to disclose for five months was fraudulent as to plaintiffs see id accordingly plaintiffs have failed to set out sufficient allegations to meet the requirements of rule b with regard to the personal loan plaintiffs allegations regarding the side arrangements with certain investors are found in paragraphs  through  of the sixth amended complaint there plaintiffs allege that falcone entered into four specific side letter arrangements two with one investor permitting alternatively  million in preferential redemptions consolidation of an investors affiliated accounts to permit it to redeem at a higher rate and a waiver of prior notice provisions for redemption ac  the terms were not disclosed to directors and other investors ac  however the directors of fund i were notified in march  that there were no side letters ac  defendants also did not disclose the side letters when it responded to annual investor questionnaires ac  these allegations too are not pleaded with sufficient particularity under rule b plaintiffs allege specifics regarding the side deals and that their very existence as well as their terms were hidden from investors however their allegation that directors were notified that no side letters existed in march  fails to identify a speaker and does not demonstrate that a fraudulent statement was made to investors moreover the allegation that harbinger specifically did not disclose the side letters in response to annual investor questionnaires see ac  does not explain how or why these answers to investor questionnaires were  fraudulent and does not specifically identify a speaker  see zerman v ball  fd   d cir  dismissing for failure to allege statements specifically from a defendant to plaintiff plaintiffs also do not allege any fraudulent statement specifically by falcone related to the side letters accordingly because plaintiffs allegations do not specifically allege any misstatements or omissions by falcone harbinger gp harbinger special situations gp or harbinger special situations offshore gp with the particularity required under rule b count iii of the sixth amended complaint must be dismissed count v of the sixth amended complaint alleges that holdings and falcone  aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty alleged in count iii however one of the elements of aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty is knowing participation in anothers breach malpiede v townson  ad   del  because plaintiffs underlying breach claims must be dismissed their aiding and abetting claims must be dismissed as well these claims would suffer from the same pleading deficiencies under rule b regardless as an independent grounds for dismissal accordingly counts iii and v of the sixth amended complaint are dismissed because although they are premised on allegations of fraud they do not plead fraud with the particularity required under rule b v derivative claims counts vi and vii subjectmatter jurisdiction in this court is based on the class action fairness act  usc § d which gives the district courts original jurisdiction over class actions that are among other requirements minimally diverse counts vi and vii which are statelaw derivative claims are before the court based on supplemental jurisdiction under  usc §  as the parties do not otherwise meet the requirement of complete diversity for the court to exercise jurisdiction under  usc § a see owen equip  erection co v kroger  though plaintiffs identify the speaker as harbinger this could refer to any defendant other than falcone plaintiffs did not give any of these entities a shorthand title of merely harbinger for the purposes of the sixth amended complaint see ac   plaintiffs pleaded this claim against falcone in the alternative to their claim in count iii   us    § a requires all plaintiffs to be diverse from all defendants ac  plaintiff schad domiciled in new  defendant falcone domiciled in new york section  also provides that a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction see  usc §   c  and that is the case here with the dismissal of all of plaintiffs class claims in counts i through v the second circuit has held that generally if all federal claims are dismissed before trial the state claims should be dismissed as well motorola credit corp v uzan  fd   d cir  quoting castellano v bd oftrs  fd   d cir  alterations and internal quotation marks omitted this rule admits of some exceptions if it is late in the action and dismissing the state claims would be exceptionally wasteful id at  but plaintiffs raise no argument that the court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction if all class claims are dismissed and the comi does not find that the circumstances warrant doing so though the complaint has gone through several iterations the case is still at the rule b stage and the vast majority of the courts work on the merits has involved slusa preclusion rather than the statelaw derivative claims thus the court finds that convenience and comity weigh in favor of the remaining statelaw claims being heard in state court and that judicial economy is not served by this case remaining in federal court see dispute resolution mgmt inc v greenberg traurig llp no cv shs  wl  at  sdny mar   given the early stage at which this lawsuit remains and the fact that there are no special considerations of efficiency or special knowledge that make it sensible for the statelaw claims to remain in federal court the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claimscounts vi and viiand therefore dismisses the remainder of the sixth amended complaint vi conclusion  for the foregoing reasons defendants motion to dismiss is granted as to all of counts i ii iii iv and v and these counts are dismissed with prejudice the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over counts vi and vii and those claims are therefore dismissed without prejudice this resolves docket nos    the clerk is requested to terminate the
