master trusts  wraps  asics moneysmart quick search skip to main navigation skip to content skip to footer my account search search query master trusts  wraps wrapping up your investments master trusts and wraps allow you to wrap your investments into one package or portfolio of investments they are generally recommended by financial advisers there are important differences between the two we explain how each of these structures work their benefits and things you should know before going down this path what is a master trust what is a wrap pros and cons of master trusts and wraps what is a master trust a master trust is an investment structure that allows an investor to hold a portfolio of managed funds under the one umbrella it provides centralised reporting and is often used by financial advisers as an easy way to manage their clients portfolio master trusts typically have the following features investments are held by a trustee in its name on behalf of the investor the value of an investors account is determined by the trustee based on the value of the underlying investments all fees and some taxes are bundled into the unit price for each investment and allocated  to the investor income from the underlying assets is paid to the master trust and then distributed to members franking credits are incorporated into the unit price of the underlying investment the underlying wholesale funds are usually specific to that master trust which means they are not portable if you want to change to a different master trust you will need to sell your current investment and buy a new one which may result in a capital gain which will be taxed at your marginal tax rate what is a wrap a wrap is similar to a master trust but it allows an investor to hold investments such as managed funds and direct shares under the one umbrella it is also used by financial advisers to provide centralised reporting and flexibility which may allow the investor to save costs wraps typically have the following features they are operated by a trustee but the investor has a beneficial ownership of the underlying assets the value of a members investment is determined by the underlying assets a wrap service uses a cash account for each member that income and expenses are passed through all fees and taxes are unbundled from the unit price and disclosed separately any income from the underlying investments is paid into a members cash account franking credits are distributed to individual investors through the cash account members assets are portable making it easy for an investor to change wrap services pros and cons of master trusts and wraps although master trusts and wraps have different structures most of these pros and cons are common to both pros  access to wholesale funds  you can access a wide range of wholesale funds that you may not be able to access individually cost  having all your investments under the one umbrella may reduce your investment costs and financial advice costs as the administration service makes buying selling and reporting much simpler online access  you can usually check your investments online at any time a master trust or wrap may offer you statements every   or  months but make sure you are not paying for more frequent statements than you need portability  with a wrap service you own the underlying investments which gives you the flexibility to move them into or out of a wrap service smart tip watch out for upfront fees when moving an existing investment to a wrap or master trust ask your adviser if any fees can be reduced or rebated to you cons suitability  if you are only invested in one or two diversified multimanager funds for example growth funds you may be incurring additional costs for an administration structure you dont need cost  fees may include administration fees fees for moving money in and out management fees for investment options and service fees from your financial adviser fees reduce the money you can invest and will impact the value of your investment over time so make sure you are only paying for services and features you need lack of portability  a master trust usually consists of investments in managed funds that are specific to that master trust which means that if you want to change advisers you may have to sell your investment which could result in a capital gain ask your adviser how many advice firms use this brand of master trust a unique offering may be a disadvantage master trusts and wraps are good for those who have a large sum of money to invest and want the convenience of one report for multiple investments a wrap or master trust may be a convenient way to reduce costs and simplify reporting but make sure it is for your benefit and not just convenient for your adviser related links shares investment warnings investment scams last updated  apr  calculators budget planner credit card calculator mortgage calculator super calculator

wanted to get our relationship with the adviser off to a constructive start we spent several evenings preparing before our first meeting we arrived for the meeting with a rough budget and paperwork on our investments insurance and loans most importantly we had discussed what we wanted to achieve in the  years before we retired and then in the years after finishing work our adviser was pretty impressed and it helped to focus the whole process what to expect at your first meeting make sure you give your adviser accurate information at the first meeting if you are not honest with your adviser or if you leave something out you could get advice thats wrong for your situation tell the adviser if you can only give limited or incomplete information you also need to be clear about which issues will be covered and which ones wont be once youve established the scope of the advice the adviser will be able to give you an idea of the cost see financial advice costs for more information discuss risk a good adviser will work with you to help identify the most suitable strategy to achieve your financial goals part of this strategy should be to protect your capital and get reasonable returns from your investments without exposing you to too much risk higher potential returns usually come with higher risks never agree to an investment product or strategy that youre not comfortable with or dont understand your attitude to risk can change with time and circumstances if youve agreed to ongoing advice you need to tell your adviser if your ability or willingness to take on more or less investment risk changes for more information see risk and return learn more about the principles of investing from our investing between the flags booklet judging your financial adviser its easy

the scope of the advice they can provide based on the amount youre willing to pay is happy to explain complicated financial concepts until you understand them the adviser pressures you to sign

invest you are confident that the adviser understands your situation needs and goals are clear about the service youre receiving what the advice will and wont cover and how much it will cost you dont understand why a particular strategy is appropriate for you dont feel comfortable asking for explanations or feel intimidated by your adviser how youll receive the financial advice after your first
