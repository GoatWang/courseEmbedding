during a general decline in the textile industry after world war i at this time hathaway was run by seabury stanton whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the depression after the merger berkshire hathaway had  plants employing over  workers with over  million in revenue and was headquartered in new bedford however seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade accompanied by large layoffs in  warren buffett began buying stock in berkshire hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill eventually buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the companys financial situation was not going to improve in  stanton made an oral tender offer of  ⁄ per share for the

this lower undercutting offer made him angry instead of selling at the slightly lower price buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire stanton which he did however this put buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing buffett initially maintained berkshires core business of textiles but by  he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of national indemnity company in the late s berkshire acquired an

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
