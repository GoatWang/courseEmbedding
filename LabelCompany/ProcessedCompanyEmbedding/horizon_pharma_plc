certain slides during his remarks today and with that ill turn the call over to tim timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc thank you tina and good morning everyone this morning we reported first quarter net sales of  million and adjusted ebitda of  million driving the  increase in net sales was a strong performance of our orphan and rheumatology business units with record sales from both krystexxa and ravicti our primary care business unit results came in significantly below expectations following the implementation of a new commercial model where we are now contracting with pharmacy benefit managers and payers to help patients obtain access to our medicines were addressing its underperformance including reducing certain costs in the primary care business unit to align our cost structure with the lower expected sales with greater visibility into the impact of this transition were lowering our fullyear  net sales guidance range it is now  billion to  billion and our adjusted ebitda guidance is now  million to  million which includes the added rd spend for teprotumumab which we announced that we acquired today we have successfully transformed the company to one that is primarily focused on rare disease medicines which now represents  of our sales and increased  in the quarter versus last year were also significantly increasing investment at one our key growth drivers krystexxa and as a result we are raising our estimate of peak annual net sales for krystexxa to more than  million from more than  million we also announced this morning our acquisition of river vision which brings us teprotumumab a biologic medicine candidate poised to enter its confirmatory phase  study for thyroid eye disease or ted in the second half of this year in addition this morning we announced the boards authorization of a share repurchase program for up to  of our outstanding shares i will now discuss our business unit results and begin with primary care total first quarter net sales for primary care business unit which include pennsaid  duexis vimovo and migergot were  million the lower net sales results were linked to implementing a new contracting model which we elected to pursue last year in order to secure broader inclusion of our primary care medicines on formularies most of the agreements became effective on january   and we recently learned when we received first quarter rebate invoices from these pbms at the end of april and the beginning of may that the implementation of this model has not performed in accordance with our expectations while our first quarter total prescription volumes for pennsaid  duexis and vimovo were roughly line with our expectations the average net realized price or anrp of these medicines came in significantly below expectations this lower anrp was driven by higher patient assistance cost and higher pbm rebate levels than we anticipated for three key reasons which are summarized on slide  of the deck we posted online first we saw lower adoption rates than we anticipated for our medicines onto certain formularies because our medicines were not adopted or covered by these plans horizon stepped in with patient support so that patients could access our medicines and this resulted in higherthanexpected patient assistance costs second most of the plans that have covered our primary care medicines in the first quarter are plans that require a higher rebate resulting in higherthanexpected rebate costs and third in the portion of our prescriptions that flow through plans that are not contracted we have seen an accelerated level of managed care control which equates to more restrictive or exclusionary formularies this industrywide trend is impacting our primary care business unit to a higher degree than we anticipated let me take a step back and cover this in more detail as shown on slide  by way of background pbm clients broadly fall into two categories those clients that follow pbmchosen formulary and those clients that do not often referred to as custom clients with pbmchosen formularies theyre administered by the pbm with custom clients the pbm works on behalf of its clients to create formularies customized for that specific client the rebate amounts paid to the pbms for clients that follow the pbmchosen formulary are typically much higher than rebates paid to custom clients when we entered into the pbm contracts we assumed a certain mix between these two types of clients and what we saw in the first quarter was a much lower adoption by custom clients than we expected so why was this mix different than our expectations when we established financial guidance for full year  we made estimates of the adoption rate and mix between each type of pbm client this took into account input from the pbms while we could see prescription volumes during the quarter we do not have full visibility into the actual client mix and the magnitude of the difference until we receive detailed pbm invoices at the end of april and beginning of may that dynamic plus the industrywide increase and acceleration in managed care control resulted in a significantly lower anrp for our primary care medicines in the quarter while we continue to work to drive adoption of primary care medicines with custom clients were not expecting improvement in the level of adoption for the remainder of  therefore we have incorporated a higher level of patient assistance costs a higher level of rebates and a lower level of total prescription volume for primary care into our revised full year  net sales forecast this has resulted in reduction to our net sales and adjusted ebitda guidance for the full year of  we now expect primary care sales of more than  million in  so what does this mean for our primary care business unit moving forward first we still believe the transition to the contracting model was the right one to make as we discussed with you in  we have seen the trend in managed care control significantly increase and it has further accelerated in  therefore transition to a contracted business model with the pbms and payers made and continues to make good sense for the longterm sustainability of this business unit as we have been communicating for the past two years we see primary care as a source of cash flow to support the expansion diversification and growth of our orphan and rheumatology business units further to continue generating cash flow contributions from our primary care business unit were reducing certain costs in primary care and other areas of our company we are reinvesting a portion of these funds from those cost reductions to accelerate growth of krystexxa and support the clinical development of teprotumumab moving now on to our orphan and rheumatology business units both delivered record performance in the quarter and are the growth engines for our future ill begin with our rheumatology business unit which generated net sales of  million or an increase of  krystexxa our biologic medicine for refractory chronic gout generated record net sales of  million an increase of  yearoveryear this was driven by the execution of our commercial organization which drove strong increase in yearoveryear vial growth last year we increased our investment in krystexxa with additional marketing medical education and commercial infrastructure including adding patient access managers to focus on patient and account support for additional krystexxa treatment sites this investment is yielding the results we were planning for and krystexxa is seeing strong momentum as a result based on the continued acceleration we have seen with krystexxa and the clear unmet need that exists for the  to  refractory chronic gout sufferers were investing significant additional resources to expand our reach to physicians and increase awareness of refractory chronic gout among both physicians and patients supporting this effort is an expansion of our krystexxa commercial organization to nearly  employees from more than  currently beginning immediately and continuing through the second half of this year we now expect krystexxa to generate peak annual net sales of more than  million up from more than  million now ill discuss our orphan business unit which is now the companys largest business unit in terms of net sales our orphan business unit generated  million of net sales in the quarter up  yearoveryear driving this strong performance was record net sales of ravicti which generated sales of  million in the quarter an increase of  versus the first quarter of  this was due to continued growth in active shipping  patients which was up nearly  yearoveryear ravicti has gained  market share of diagnosed patients up from  in the fourth quarter of  we expect continued doubledigit growth for ravicti in  as we identify more undiagnosed and untreated patients who can benefit from this important medicine procysbi also contributed to a strong performance of the orphan business unit procysbi net sales in the quarter were  million an increase of  compared to first quarter  sales under raptor of  million an increase of active shipping  patients of more than  drove these strong net sales results procysbi is indicated for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis a rare and lifethreatening metabolic disorder and growth has been driven by continued strong conversion from older generation medicine as well as adoption of previously untreated patients we see continued opportunity for further penetration and expect continued doubledigit sales growth for the medicine in  actimmunes first quarter net sales were  million up  as we discussed last quarter we have evolved our commercial strategy to establish the role of actimmune in a broader range of cgd patients including those patients awaiting a bone marrow transplant actimmune remains on track to return to growth for the full year  we continue to explore additional pipeline opportunities for actimmune with development efforts in oncology that jeff will review in more detail our orphan business unit and krystexxa combined represent  of our first quarter net sales compared to roughly  in  evidence that we have successfully transformed and diversified horizon into a rare disease medicine company we further advanced this goal today with our announcement to acquire river vision an important first step at assembling a portfolio of development stage orphan medicines through acquisition inlicensing and internal development river vision is a privatelyheld company with its only asset being teprotumumab a biologic readytoenter pivotal clinical study for thyroid eye disease or ted ted is a rare condition in which the eye muscles and tissue behind the eye become inflamed causing the eye to be pushed forward resulting in debilitating pressure headaches decreased vision and in severe cases an inability for the eyelids to cover the eyes with no approved medicines to treat ted theres a significant unmet need among the approximately  patients in the united states with moderate to severe disease and we anticipate a potential peak annual net sales opportunity for teprotumumab if approved in excess of  million in the united states importantly teprotumumab has received orphan drug fast track and breakthrough therapy designations from the us fda and has completed phase  clinical development and the results were published last week in the new england journal of medicine jeff will discuss the teprotumumab clinical development program in more detail but first let me turn the call over to paul who will review our other financial results as well as our guidance paul paul w hoelscher  horizon pharma plc thanks tim my comments this morning will primarily focus on our nongaap results ill begin with the first quarter financial results and then move to a discussion of our full year and second quarter  guidance for the first quarter net sales totaled  million an increase of  versus the first quarter of  our nongaap gross profit ratio was  of net sales in the first quarter and was lower than previous quarters primarily due to lower anrp in the primary care business unit total nongaap operating expenses were  million nongaap rd expense was  million and included clinical investments in krystexxa procysbi ravicti and actimmune oncology beginning with the first quarter this year we are combining sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses into a single expense line item sga in order to simplify our presentation and conform to standard practices of our peer group for reference we have provided two years of history in the earnings press release nongaap sga expenses were  million an increase of  million versus the first quarter of  this increase was principally due to the increased investment in krystexxa which began in the second quarter of  and sga related to the raptor business that we acquired in  the income tax rate in the first quarter of  on a gaap basis was  and on a nongaap basis was negative  nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of  were  million and  respectively the weighted average diluted shares outstanding used to calculate nongaap diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of  was  million and lastly before moving to the discussion of full year guidance let me provide a few highlevel comments about our cash flow and balance sheet for the first quarter of  we generated  million of operating cash flow on a gaap basis on a nongaap basis operating cash flow for the first quarter was  million cash and cash equivalents were  million as of march  during the first quarter we refinanced our senior secured term loans consolidated the term loans at a lower interest rate and extended the maturity date from  to  as of march  the total principal amount of our debt outstanding was  billion please note that the refinancing had a negative impact on our first quarter operating cash flow due to the fact that we were required to pay our term loan accrued interest balance of  million at the time of the refinancing our next interest payment was originally scheduled for may this lowered our operating cash flow results for the first quarter on both a gaap and a nongaap basis based on the midpoint of our  full year adjusted ebitda guidance our net debt as of march  adjusted for the upfront payments for river vision represents a net debttoebitda leverage ratio of  times our current capital structure resulted in a weighted average cash interest rate of approximately  based in current libor rates now moving on to guidance as tim referenced reflecting the impact of lowerthanexpected first quarter primary care results on our expectations for the full year our revised net sales guidance for the full year  is  billion to  billion and full year adjusted ebitda is  million to  million this assumes continued strong growth for both the orphan and rheumatology business units and primary care net sales to be more than  million full year nongaap gross margin is expected to be approximately  to  a slight decrease from the prior guidance due to lower primary care anrp  regarding our full year operating expenses as tim referenced we are reducing certain costs in our primary care business unit as well as other company costs we are investing a portion of those cost savings into krystexxa in order to further accelerate net sales growth in  and beyond our cost reduction initiatives net of the krystexxa investment will primarily affect the second half of the year however the benefit of the cost reduction will be offset by the investment of approximately  million in developmentrelated expenses associated with our river vision acquisition and that spending will occur primarily in the second half of  therefore we anticipate the our quarterly operating expense for the remainder of the year on a dollar basis to be similar to the first quarter operating expense for interest expense we expect a range of between  million and  million for full year  based on current libor rates based on our revised guidance we now expect a nongaap tax rate in the low s for the full year  this is higher than our previous guidance principally due to a change in the forecasted mix of earnings by tax jurisdiction as a result of the lower net sales expected for primary care in  our full year tax rate guidance for  reflects the river vision transaction announced this morning as we have said before any future acquisitions may impact our forecasted nongaap tax rate relative to share count for the full year we expect our weighted average diluted share count to be in a similar range as the first quarter for the second quarter we expect net sales to be  to  of our full year  net sales guidance and we expect the adjusted ebitda to be  to  of our full year  adjusted ebitda guidance this includes strong continued growth of our rheumatology and orphan business units offset by the expected decline in primary care and as a reminder we expect second quarter operating expense on a dollar basis to be in line with the first quarter we expect the nongaap tax rate in the second quarter to be approximately  to  which given the first quarters favorable tax rate of negative  would result in a first half nongaap tax rate consistent with our full year guidance of the low s ill now conclude with a brief comment on our recent share repurchase authorization of up to  million shares our current intention is to execute a portion of the buyback authorization this year depending on market conditions and our other investment opportunities with that ill now turn the call over to jeff jeffrey w sherman md facp  horizon pharma plc thank you paul i will provide a brief update on our clinical development programs concluding with the review of the teprotumumab program which we are acquiring with the river vision transaction let us start with ravicti which is indicated for ucds as we announced last week we received fda approval for supplemental new drug application or snda for ravicti to expand the age range from patients two years of age and older to patients two months of age and older this is an important step in helping young children with ucds and the devastating effects of hyperammonemic events were also studying patients from birth to two months of age and remain on track to submit an snda to expand to this age range by the first quarter of  now let me touch on actimmune and our development efforts in oncology as we have previously discussed we are evaluating actimmune to enhance the effect of a pd inhibitor opdivo in a phase  oncology dose escalation trial with the fox chase cancer center the trial continues to progress well preclinical research indicates that interferon gamma could potentially enhance the effects of pd and pdl inhibitors potentially improving cancer patient outcome as we discussed last quarter data was presented from the fox chase trial at the american society of clinical oncology society for immunotherapy of cancer meeting while early preliminary data show that combination therapy with actimmune and opdivo was safe and well tolerated in the first two cohorts and the study continues to assess additional dose cohorts while the results are early we are encouraged the information being analyzed will inform the decision to proceed into the next phase of the study and we look forward to additional data being made available in the coming months in addition to fox chase a number of other leading academic and clinical institutions have expressed interest in studying actimmune as combination of therapy in certain cancers this includes the recent decision of the national cancer institute to initiate a study later this year to treat patients with cutaneous tcell lymphoma with actimmune and keytruda pd inhibitor with krystexxa beginning with the american college of rheumatology meeting last november we had a significant clinical presence where we presented krystexxa clinical data and expanded the awareness of krystexxa as an important option for patients suffering from refractory chronic gout we are continuing to build on these efforts and look forward to presenting additional data at upcoming rheumatology meetings and as we have discussed before the investigatorinitiated triple trial continues to enroll patients and provide informative data the trial is evaluating immunogenicity as it relates to krystexxa and studying a number of different subsets of patients including those with an increased body weight lastly let me share some insight on the acquisition we announced this morning of river vision and its late stage biologic candidate teprotumumab for ted teprotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is in late stage development as a treatment for moderate to severe ted it targets the insulinlike growth factor receptor or igfr ted is a rare debilitating and very painful condition that today has no fdaapproved therapeutic treatment it is associated with graves disease a common thyroid disorder that causes hyperthyroidism when the thyroid gland produces excess hormone the treatment approach for ted today includes highdose steroids biologics such as rituximab radiation and surgery these treatments have limited efficacy as well as safety concerns because teprotumumab inhibits igfr it is in development to specifically target the underlying cause of ted where we have seen significant clinical efficacy in the reduction of proptosis which is a measure of eye protrusion and the main symptom of ted teprotumumab has completed phase  clinical development a multicenter doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled phase  study lasted  weeks and involved  patients it was the largest ever multicenter trial in ted the study shows that  of the study patients receiving infusions of teprotumumab once every three weeks in treating active moderate to severe ted demonstrated statistically significant reduced proptosis and increased quality of life compared to  in the placebo group additionally teprotumumab was well tolerated with hyperglycemia as the only drugrelated adverse event in diabetic patients which was controlled by adjusting their diabetes medications in fact last week the phase  clinical trial results were published in the new england journal of medicine the goal of the pivotal phase  trial which we anticipate beginning in the second half of this year is to confirm the phase  results the phase  trial will be similar in design to the phase  trial and is currently under discussion with the fda teprotumumab has received orphan drug fast track and breakthrough therapy designations from the fda fast track designation means that we will have the ability to submit sections of the bla dossier on a rolling basis as well as to be considered for priority review at the time of the bla submission breakthrough therapy designation means that fda will expedite the development and bla review of teprotumumab we also plan to explore other applications of teprotumumab where inhibition of igfr could yield therapeutic benefits i look forward to sharing more with you about our clinical development programs as they advance with that i will turn the call back over to tim timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc thank you jeff in summary we delivered strong first quarter performance in our orphan and rheumatology business units with record sales of krystexxa and ravicti which supports our transformation to a company predominantly focused on rare disease medicines the acquisition of river vision and teprotumumab announced today builds on that strategy by adding a late stage development program in our orphan business unit our cash flows and balance sheet gives us flexibility to consider strategic opportunities that support our growth strategy as well as share repurchase authorization each of these initiatives allows us to generate longterm value for our shareholders finally while our primary care results were significantly lower than perspective we are managing the transition to a contracting model which we continue to believe was the right decision to enhance the durability and sustainability of this business over the long term ultimately our diversification strategy over the last two and a half years has allowed us to shift the mix of our business from  primary care sales in the first half of  to approximately  rare disease medicine sales in the first quarter of  we believe we are well positioned to continue our diversification strategy and drive the business forward with that tina well open the call for questions tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks tim cailey please open the call questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of ken cacciatore with cowen and company your line is open ken cacciatore  cowen  co llc hey good morning guys timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc good morning ken ken cacciatore  cowen  co llc a question on the specialty pharma business just wondering what strategic alternatives could you contemplate with that business and then also as a followup just help us understand what you can do or what you can control to get that coverage up i just dont know the difference between what you can do and what your partners in managed care are doing how do you impact that thank you robert f carey  horizon pharma plc so ken this is bob carey regarding primary care and what our options are as we have stated in the past all options are on the table we continue to look for strategic alternatives if theyre available and so we will continue to do that as we move forward here we have as weve talked about in the past viewed the primary care business as a source of cash flow that were using to diversify the business into specialty orphan assets and specialty assets which weve successfully executed on over the last two and a halfplus years and as we see other opportunities arise for this business if there is a transaction that makes sense then we will pursue it so our eyes are open and were being aggressive about looking for opportunities and with that maybe ill turn it over to tim to answer the other part of the question timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc so with the second question ken let me just talk about what we saw in the first quarter and what we expect for the rest of the year first of all we didnt have any internal data or visibility into the mix of pbm clients until late april or early may when we received invoices from them and got that visibility into the actual mix between the pbmchosen clients or what was referred exclusion lives as typically referred as and custom clients and at that time we were able to figure out the financial impact the mix of pbmchosen formulary clients and custom clients was significantly different than what we expected and the mix was skewed to much higher pbmchosen formulary clients which had a higher rebate so a very small portion of the mix was actually from custom clients which we had a lower rebate because our overall strategy in negotiating is come to a blended rebate where we pay lower rebate costs where theres less control in the custom clients and higher rebates in whats called pbmchosen formulary clients so ultimately this meant that our medicines werent covered on those custom client formularies and therefore weve provided incremental patient assistance above our expectations so ultimately we went from a large number of prescriptions that would be at a lower rebate to the opposite where we had much few number of prescriptions at a lower rebate which resulted in much larger number of prescriptions that we overall provided via patient assistance on a net basis this is what led to the lower average net realized price and as we look forward to the impact to rest of the year and based on the discussions with custom clients that we had in march and april and so far early in may we learned that we should expect a much lower assumption of adoption by these custom clients for the remainder of  they made their decisions during the selling season last year and we dont expect any material change within the custom client formulary coverage for the remainder of  which is what we built in to our goforward guidance and as we said during the call were reducing costs in our primary care business and were reinvesting it in growth to drive the expansion and longterm growth of krystexxa and into the development of teprotumumab ken cacciatore  cowen  co llc okay thank you tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks ken cailey well take the next question please operator our next question comes from the line of david amsellem with piper jaffray your line is open david a amsellem  piper jaffray  co thanks so maybe ill ask a strategic alternatives question on the primary care business another way i guess the way id ask it is you have set these aspirational targets by  for the top line i believe it was something around  billion so i guess maybe the question is this i mean do you see horizon as having a presence in painprimary care  at the end of the decade and then secondly a nonrelated question this is on krystexxa just looking at the volume trends i mean is there any evidence to suggest that youre seeing a plateauing of vial volume growth and maybe talk about where monthly vial volumes are for april and what youre seeing currently thanks timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc so ill start with krystexxa we have not seen any plateauing at all we actually continue to see acceleration of the vials on a monthly and quarterly basis vikram do you want to add anything vikram karnani  horizon pharma plc yeah i think the only thing ill add here is the momentum continues in terms of adoption of new accounts as well as vials as tim pointed out so we dont see any plateauing in terms of volume or additional patients getting on therapy timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc and one of the things that weve seen with adding our patient access managers in the fourth quarter is a decrease in time from benefit investigation to patients actually getting infused and thats something that were going to address by significantly increasing the number of patient access managers as part of our overall expansion and we expect a continued acceleration of vials on a monthly and quarterly basis throughout the rest of the year to your first question david around what we expect by  and  our first is that we expect strong growth above our original expectations with krystexxa where we now expect it to be over  million in peak sales as you saw today with both ravicti and procysbi strong  sequential growth in average shipping patients or yearoveryear growth in average shipping patients so we expect our orphan group and krystexxa where raptor wasnt included in those original expectations to be a fair amount higher than our original thoughts towards the end of the decade as far as the alternatives with primary care ill let bob address that robert f carey  horizon pharma plc sure and i think david given the change in that business we still maintain the same position on it that it is a source of cash flow that we can redeploy into the further expansion of our orphan and rheumatology business thats our planning scenario as we move forward so that would indicate that absent some opportunity arising where we were to monetize it for some attractive sum we will continue to manage it in that way and so we see a good source of cash flow for us to continue the expansion of our business which is the plan that were pursuing tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks david cailey next question please operator our next question comes from the line of marc goodman with ubs your line is open marc goodman  ubs securities llc yes morning i guess first if you take a product like vimovo and the revenues that you put up i mean should we assume we just take the pricing on vimovo that kind of came in with the scripts for the quarter that the pricing is going to basically stay the same and the scripts are going to come down i mean just give us a sense of how youre thinking about this i mean if youre pulling some promotion we should expect obviously prescriptions not really to get better but are we expecting pricing to get better throughout this year just help us because it almost looks like the way youve got guidance of  million its like kind of take what you see in the first quarter and its not much of a change so it doesnt seem like theres much of improvement and tim you mentioned that you still believe signing these contracts was the right strategy but i guess maybe you could just explain to us what you mean by that because it doesnt feel that way and then third on krystexxa i know that youve got a lot of different studies that are going on by different physicians and stuff where are we on those studies they havent even come out yet to help you with that product and it seems like the products really taken off thanks timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc well with krystexxa in the triple trial that weve discussed it has come out in several forms its been at abstracts at the acr meeting most recently in november we expect to see more abstracts coming out in the june timeframe at the european rheumatology conference eular so these are investigatorinitiated trials where as we get ongoing updates those updates are communicated at key industry conferences so to get to your first question marc when we look at – relative to contracting this is the right decision its certainly a reasonable question and its one that weve thought about a lot over the last  days as weve gotten this information we do believe that contracting was the right decision to provide longterm access to our medicines but it certainly was a more negative impact in the short term in effect thats reset the business and when we look at it and see over the last two years and many of our peers have noted this the markets changing we saw the trend in managed care control continue to increase with payers putting more barriers in place so as we saw this trend continuing we made the decision to do these contracts what weve seen so far in  in our noncontracted lives is a dramatic increase in acceleration of controls in  so we believe that if in fact we did not do these contracts that long term we would be in a negative position so we think we made the right decision in the long term for this business its a onetime reset based on the dynamics that we discussed relative to how we see the rest of the year going we expect to drive sequential improvement in anrp throughout the year as we have seen historically and this is assumed in our updated primary care guidance of greater than  million when we looked at trx volume assumptions its reflected as you noted of reduced commercial infrastructure and were no longer expecting retail prescription uplift from the pbm agreements and we have increased control impacting volume so when we look at our assumptions like you see most years the impact on deductibles and copay and coinsurance in the beginning of the year those areas will continue to improve but as i mentioned earlier the custom clients and getting on incremental formularies in  is not expected marc goodman  ubs securities llc tim is the primary care business profitable right now and if its not when will it be timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc it is marc goodman  ubs securities llc it is timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc and it remains profitable marc goodman  ubs securities llc even at the first quarter levels timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc when we look at  we expect the business to be profitable tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks marc cailey next question please operator our next question comes from the line of annabel samimy with stifel your line is open andrew ang  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey guys this is andrew in for annabel i had a question timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc hi andrew andrew ang  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey on the negative anrps what other work are you doing with pbms to address this for this year and longer term and my second question is on the leverage ratio so the leverage ratios supposed decline with increasing ebitda but now you that have a declining ebitda what can you do about the leverage ratio it looks like youre using extra cash for cash repurchases timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc so when we look at our leverage ratio yes our ebitdas reset  as we reported this morning but we do expect to have solid continuing growth in ebitda as we move into subsequent quarters and years so the first question was what was the first around anrp tina ventura  horizon pharma plc right hows the anrp going to move up throughout the year what are you going to do with pbms in order to address this timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc right so relative to pbms one of the things i mentioned earlier is that as weve been out having discussions with our managed care team over the march april and to this month what weve learned is that these custom clients where they develop their own formularies in conjunction with the pbms we dont expect to get incremental formulary coverages in  however we do expect the selling season for  to begin in early and throughout the third and into the fourth quarter so our managed care effort and that teams effort will be working with plans pbms and formularies to really drive a strong formulary coverage with the custom clients as we can for beginning of  tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks andrew andrew ang  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you tina ventura  horizon pharma plc cailey operator our next question comes from the line of gary nachman with bmo capital markets your line is open gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states hi first i just wanted to confirm that last point so is this just a oneyear dynamic until you get some of these custom clients on board or could we actually see significant declines in primary care going forward beyond this year just elaborate on that and then priorities with cash did share repo move to the top will we see more boltons could you actually do a transformational deal at this point if you found something that was interesting for you robert f carey  horizon pharma plc gary on the second part of the question at this point what we see as capacity is weve got round numbers about  billion in capital to work with in  thats available cash and cash flow that is generated through the balance of this year and so were going to continue to look for opportunities to deploy that into transactions that will be overall valueadded secondly with respect to additional debt capacity unless theres a significant ebitdagenerating asset thats not in the plans at this point and as for transformational transactions we continue to look but at this point theres nothing that we would point to on the horizon rather its probably going to be more incremental as opposed to transformational unless something arises that we cant anticipate right now timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc and gary to your first question relative to moving forward the key thing in looking at is there upside as we move into  the key thing for us to understand is what occurs during that  selling season we have a good understanding whats going to occur in the pbmchosen formularies but the key to understand for us is the uptake in custom clients that will be part of that selling season that occurs in the third quarter so for that reason we think its prudent to see how the rest of the year plays out and continue to focus on that business as bob mentioned its going to continue to generate cash flow sales and ebitda but at this point we dont have enough information to provide forward guidance in  gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states and just one quick followup on the cost cuts did you take anyone out from the managed care effort or is it all just on the actual sales reps just to give us a little bit of color around that thanks timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc so to the question on managed care effort weve put a managed care team in place that is going to be critical to be working with individual payers pbms throughout the second and third quarters to give ourselves the best chance possible to be included in some of these custom client lives so that organization will be critical moving forward tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks gary gary nachman  bmo capital markets united states thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of donald ellis with jmp securities your line is open donald bruce ellis  jmp securities llc thank you good morning everyone timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc good morning donald bruce ellis  jmp securities llc a couple questions back on this – todays acquisition of river vision phase  compound going into phase  and announcing a stock buyback at the same time bob is that telling us – suggesting to us something about the price and availability of currently marketed maybe accretive product acquisitions and then secondly more philosophically everyones talking about the primary care franchise business and your increasing reliance in the orphan drug business which is exactly what you said you were going to do when do you simply divest the primary carespec pharma business become a  orphan business and enjoy much higher biotech multiple and remove your company from the kind of the valeant mylan  cloud where you never belonged anyway thanks timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc well certainly a good point we look at our business – as you mentioned our strategy has been to diversify two years ago we had all primary care now  of our business is in orphan krystexxa and we expect that to continue to accelerate especially with the addition of teprotumumab and moving into late stage development so that is going to be the focus when we look at further acquisitions if we can get bolton inlicensing and other type acquisitions were certainly going to look to build the longterm future of our orphan business bob has mentioned and can reiterate what our views are as far as the primary care business and strategic options robert f carey  horizon pharma plc sure and don if there was an opportunity to sell the business for an attractive price we would execute on that and become a primarily or an exclusively orphanrheum business we see today an opportunity to continue to run that business and generate cash flows so the only planning scenario that we can control is that one and so thats what were doing but availing ourselves of opportunities were encouraged with the strategy that weve been pursuing weve built based on the guidance we put out here a  million a year orphanrheumatology business in  that has very attractive growth rates and attractive margins and one that were going to continue to focus on building so were excited about the opportunity to do that and we believe we can be successful as we have been over the last two and a half years pursuing that strategy we continue to see opportunities so the move into river vision isnt a reaction to there being overly high prices for revenueebitdaproducing assets but rather part of the strategy that weve been executing on which is to build a portfolio of development stage compounds behind the portfolio of commercial compounds that we have in orphan and rheum and we think that thats going to provide us with a longer runway on the business as well as allow us to continue to move into differentiated proprietary assets that have – where theres high medical need in the markets with these patients and so its all part of a strategy that weve been pursuing and will continue to pursue and believe we can be successful in executing on donald bruce ellis  jmp securities llc thank you for taking my question tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks don cailey operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david risinger with morgan stanley your line is open david r risinger  morgan stanley  co llc yes thanks very much timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc hi david david r risinger  morgan stanley  co llc hello i have a question for tim and then for paul so tim when you discussed the benefits of pbm contracting this winter i think you conveyed the improved coverage benefits offering and opportunity for potentially growing volumes but on todays call youve emphasized increased control so if you could just talk a little bit more about that and how that happened in the face of the pbm contracts that you signed and then a second question paul is could you just update us on the pro forma net debt that you have post todays deal i just wanted to understand that figure to compare it to the forward ebitda of the midpoint i believe is  million thank you timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc all right thanks dave appreciate the question and certainly reasonable again ill step back and look at where we were with our  guidance in february at the time we expected an estimated adoption trajectory and mix of pbm clients between those custom clients ive discussed and pbmchosen formulary clients knowing that were unable to participate in the  selling because were informed of those decisions late in  our guidance was also based on an understanding of our patient assistance costs that we had through mid february and our estimate in what we saw in prescription volume so when we look at what happened in the first quarter as i discussed earlier is we didnt have the internal data and visibility into the mix of those pbm clients and it wasnt till we had the detailed invoices in late april and early may that we had full insight into the actual mix of these pbmchosen clients and the custom clients and at that time when we could actually calculate the financial impact were very surprised by what we saw and what we found was that the mix of pbmchosen formulary clients and the custom clients was significantly different than what we expected so the mix was skewed towards the higher pbmchosen formulary clients where we pay a high rebate so our net rebate cost increased significantly i mean it ultimately meant that our medicines werent covered on these custom client formularies and we provided incremental patient assistance which drove incremental cost and gross to net so we went from an assumption that we had a large number of prescriptions that would be at a low rebate to a situation that was the opposite and that we needed a – had a much fewer number of prescriptions at a low rebate where we had much larger prescriptions that we had to subsidize through patient support this is what drove decreased anrp and when you look at prescription volume our volume in the first quarter was generally in line with our expectations but moving forward our volume is expected to reflect our reduced commercial infrastructure as well as increased control all of which was factored into the guidance that we discussed this morning paul do you want to take the second question paul w hoelscher  horizon pharma plc yeah so david the total debt right now is  billion as we said we had  million of cash at march  and if you back out the  million that wed be paying today for river vision that leaves you about  million of cash and so on a net debt basis you have about  billion of debt and with the midpoint of our ebitda range that leaves you at about a  times net debt leverage tina ventura  horizon pharma plc thanks david david r risinger  morgan stanley  co llc thank you tina ventura  horizon pharma plc cailey i think we have time for one more question operator thank you our last question comes from the line of liav abraham with citi your line is open liav abraham  citigroup global markets inc good morning many of my questions have been asked but i just wanted to touch on your longer term projections for your primary care business tim youve talked about  million in primary care revenues by  can you provide any updated thoughts on what this number could be and to what extent you have the visibility to forecast this business beyond  and through the end of the decade thank you timothy p walbert  horizon pharma plc thats a question i just answered so ill just reiterate what i said and that is that we expect the primary care business to continue to generate cash flow and ebitda and be profitable and we believe its prudent to see how the rest of the year plays out and as i mentioned its critical that we get an understanding what the selling season looks like and how we understand what the pbmchosen formularies look like we need to better understand what the customclient formularies look like as a result of that selling season and at that point we will provide goforward guidance tina ventura  horizon pharma plc great thanks liav and
