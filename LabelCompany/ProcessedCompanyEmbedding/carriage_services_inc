statesthe company’s q  results have demonstrated strong growth with sales growing by  compared to q here we discuss the robust qualitative factors that are driving carriage services growth before providing a valuation on the businessthis post was written by hamish kumar integer investments analyst investment thesis carriage services nysecsv recent earnings release emphasizes the company’s strong qualitative factors and earnings power with a strong industry outlook for deathcare goods and services we believe that the company warrants a hold recommendation what does it do carriage services is a provider of deathcare products and services in the united states the company operates through both funeral home and cemetery segments the funeral home segment includes but is not limited to offering burial cremation consultation and transportation services the cemetery segment provides products and services such as the right to interment in cemetery sites additionally carriage services offers deathcare related merchandise including urns burial caskets and cremation memorialization products as of december   the company operated  funeral homes in  states and  cemeteries in  states recent performance carriage services q  earnings were reported on april th the company has had another strong quarter with revenue increasing  and operating income increasing  compared to prior year results this was driven by a combination of comparable funeral segment revenue growth and corporate expense savings funeral service revenues were primarily driven through acquisitions whereas corporate expenses saving gains were attributed to unusually high comparable costs in  a summary of the results is presented below competitive advantage carriage services has two competitive advantages  although carriage services doesn’t have a particularly large market share estimated  the majority of deathcare providers are locally owned and independent the company is therefore larger than the majority of competitors this larger size has meant that csv has considerably driven overhead costs down through economies of scale this has resulted in greater cash flows and the ability to further grow through acquisitions  carriage services has the ability to provide a fullservice package merchandise funeral services and burialcremation for customers this means that the business can take care of all of the planning required for a funeral service to run smoothly this is particularly appealing to customers as it reduces both the stress and time involved in preparations although certain other competitors provide similar offerings competition is location based csv may therefore be the only provider of this offering in certain regions industry and business drivers as stated in csv’s annual report although there are several public companies that own funeral service locations and cemeteries the majority of deathcare businesses in north america are locallyowned independent operations given the sensitive nature of the business relationships fostered at the local level build trust in the community and are a key driver of market share while new entrants may enter any given market the time and resources required to develop local heritage and tradition serve as important barriers to entry the position of a single funeral service location or cemetery in any community is a function of the name reputation and location of that funeral service location or cemetery although competitive pricing professional service and attention and wellmaintained locations are also important during  the number of deaths in the united states increased by approximately  following a  and a  increase in  and  respectively we expect this rapid growth to continue going forward expected growth of  to  causing the industry to be well positioned for medium and longterm profitable growth the large baby boomer populations which in  are aged  to  are already impacting the industry today this is primarily through demand for preneed cemetery and funeral sales preneed deferred revenue on services and merchandise however as this population category continues to age we will also see a growth in at need sales it is worth noting that currently  of total funeral segment revenue is derived through preneed sales for the cemetery segment however this represents  of total segment revenue specifically in regards to carriage services the business adopts a decentralized operating model enabling the business to further attract entrepreneurial talent in its industry the company’s focus is to partner with the best of the remaining independent funeral home and cemetery owners in major strategic markets around the country particularly where the potential for future revenue growth is the highest longterm growth strategies carriage services has grown at a steady rate over the last several years however is this growth purely driven by the industry in accordance with management the company has several key growth initiatives these initiatives are explained below  acquisitions the company remains acquisition focused within both the funeral and cemetery segments within the funeral segment acquisitions would provide the potential for scale in areas with the highest return customer categories and market traits with rising demand for cemeteries and cemetery services expected in the coming years due to demographic changes making acquisitions in this segment now could prove to be lucrative for the business in the future carriage services has a flexible capital structure with no nearterm debt maturity issues although the debttoequity of  seems high this is quite characteristic of the industry considering its stable cash flows and low correlation to the performance of the wider economy we therefore believe that csv can continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment to fund acquisition related growth where necessary the company has also acquired through retained earnings and additional equity issues  preneed trust due to the business’s  million backlog of preneed receipts carriage services has invested a large sum of this money in investment trusts csv maintains a low risk investment structure with relatively liquid assets in its portfolio this is demonstrated by the fact that the trust currently only invests in debt instruments the business also enjoys favorable terms with thirdparty insurance providers independent operators cannot easily duplicate these arrangements with third parties this gives the business an edge in funding future growth and profitability over time  decentralized operating model as alluded to above the business adopts a decentralized operating model this enables the company to attract entrepreneurial talent to further grow the business incentive plans are also tailored to this goal where managing partners receive a particularly large bonus every five years if their division generates a cagr of  or more over the same period risks in fairness there aren’t many significant risks associated to carriage services the company has a strong balance sheet with no nearterm debt due the industry also isn’t strongly correlated to macroeconomic factors the biggest issue for csv however is the fact that the industry itself determines the revenue and profitability for the business with industry demand currently increasing due to the growing age of the baby boomer population what will happen in the future can growth be sustainable beyond the baby boomer generation valuation

demonstrating the performance of comparable companies over the last year ttm our analysis shows that csv has generated slightly less growth than its comparable companies although this is not by a

mission and our guiding principles for carriage are not negotiable and never will be over time we have adopted new ideas and frameworks to help us continuously improve while eliminating other practices and concepts that may have kept us from full alignment to our vision and continuous improvement these have included some of the following from our founding in  to  we operated on budgets which we abandoned in  in favor of our standards operating model this decision allowed for us to more closely realign our operating practices with our five guiding principles especially our beliefs in shared success employee ownership the power of people decentralization and partnership without budgets we have been free to focus on leadership people and culture shortly thereafter we adopted concepts from jim collins’ book “good to great” and customized them into our culture and practices ie first who then what right people in right seats flywheel effect in  carriage services adopted jack welch’s e leadership model to identify the required skills necessary for a high performance company in  we embarked upon a “new beginning” and launched our “good to great” journey with the idea of

acquisition model in unison is the key to our attaining high and sustainable performance standards operating model e leadership model strategic acquisition model the standards operating model our “being the best” standards focus on market share people and the operating and financial metrics that drive longterm performance to date the standards operating model has driven significant changes in our organization leadership and operating practices most importantly the standards operating model allows us to determine the sustainable revenue growth and earning power of our portfolio of funeral home and cemetery businesses our standards are designed to drive longerterm performance by growing market share and creating new heritage and producing consistent modest revenue growth and a sustainable increasing level of earnings and cash flow our standards are not designed to produce maximum shortterm earnings because carriage does not believe such performance is sustainable without ultimately stressing the business which often leads to declining market share revenues and earnings the standards operating model eliminated the use of financial budgets budget control model which freed up enormous amounts of time to work on growing each local business and improving the quality and skills of the staff standards achievement is the measure by which we judge the success of each business standards council the standards operating model was originally developed by a group of former owner partners and top managers the standards council the standards council studied and evaluated the key drivers of development of success at carriage’s best business over a fiveyear period their work led to the development of standards operating model and the related incentives compensation plan at the end of each year the standards council members for each of our three regions meet review and approve the standards achievement and related incentive compensation awards for each business incentives align with standards each managing partner participates in a variable annual being the best bonus plan whereby they earn a percentage of their business’ calendar year earnings based upon the actual standards achieved for that year and has the opportunity to share in the earnings of the business as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standard of  of the total standards achievement for that calendar year each managing partner also participates in a longterm  year good to great variable bonus plan whereby they earn a bonus payment equaling the average being the best annual incentive bonus over five years times a multiple of twice the compounded annual growth rate of the net revenue when they have achieved revenue growth by a minimum of  over  years the e leadership model the standards operating model requires strong leadership to grow an entrepreneurial highvalue personal service and sales business at sustainable field ebitda margins our e leadership model is based upon principles established by jack welch during his tenure as ceo at general electric and is based upon e qualities essential to succeed in a high performance culture energy to get the job done the ability to energize others the edge necessary to make difficult decisions and the ability to execute and produce results to achieve a high level of standards in a business year after year we must have “a players” in charge who have the e leadership skills  to grow the business by hiring training and developing highly motivated and productive teams that produce results strategic acquisition model we believe a primary driver of higher revenue and profits in the future will be the execution of our strategic acquisition model using strategic ranking criteria to assess acquisition and divestiture candidates as we execute this strategy over the next ten years we will affiliate with many of the best remaining independents in demographically attractive strategic markets we are disciplined in qualifying acquisition candidates since we are looking for high performance partners over time we believe we can execute our acquisition strategy without proportionate incremental investment in our consolidation platform infrastructure or additional fixed regional and corporate overhead consequently the sustained earning power of our portfolio as defined by our consolidated ebitda margin should incrementally increase over time as we execute the strategic acquisition model connect on facebook join us on linkedin            home carriage culture partnering
