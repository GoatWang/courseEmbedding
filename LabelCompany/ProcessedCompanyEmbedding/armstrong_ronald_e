delivered industryleading products and services to our customers worldwide paccar delivered  trucks during the first quarter peterbilt and kenworth raised build rates during the quarter in response to robust order intake looking ahead we expect a  increase in deliveries in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to higher build rates in north america and australia second quarter gross margins are projected to be slightly higher than first quarter margins reflecting the operational benefits of higher build rates paccars forecast for europes greater than tonne market has been increased to a range of  to  units reflecting strong demand and the steady economic outlook europes gdp growth expectations for this year are  in the uk and on the continent freight transport activity

economic picture in the us is also positive with gdp forecast to grow  this year housing starts are projected to grow  to  million units and the automotive industry is expected to deliver  million vehicles industrial production is estimated to grow  this year due to stronger manufacturing and mining output this will be the first year of industrial production expansion since  we estimate us and canadian class  truck industry retail sales will be in a range of  to  units this year the economys steady growth is supportive of healthy freight levels the ata tonnage index continues at high levels peterbilt and kenworths share of industry class  orders so far this year is strong at  as customers appreciate the benefits of kenworth and peterbilts reliable and fuelefficient trucks and industryleading resale values paccar parts quarterly pretax income was a record  million  higher than a year ago pretax return on revenue was an excellent  paccar parts business generated quarterly revenues of  million  higher than in the same quarter of last year these results were driven by the growing number of paccar trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by paccar parts and our dealers paccars dealers worldwide have invested over  billion over the last five years to open  new dealer locations in north america and europe paccars new truck models and expanded powertrain have created a tremendous business opportunity for paccar and our dealers these dealer network investments support paccars continued growth in truck market share and aftermarket sales paccar financial services first quarter pretax income was  million compared to  million earned a year ago excellent portfolio performance was partly offset by the effects of the industrys lower used truck values in the us and canada paccar financial continued to invest in the remarketing of paccar trucks by opening its third truck remarketing center near chicago these truck centers further enhance kenworth and peterbilt residual values which command a  to  premium over competitors trucks paccars strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to

targeted for truck and powertrain product development enhanced manufacturing and parts distribution facilities and aftermarket support programs paccar continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by delivering the highest quality products and services in the industry thank you id be pleased to answer your questions questionandanswer session operator your first question will come from the line of jerry revich of goldman sachs jerry revich  goldman sachs  co hi good morning everyone ronald e armstrong  paccar inc good morning jerry jerry revich  goldman sachs  co can you talk about which regions drove the acceleration in the part sales in this quarter how broadbased is it and it sounds like the inventory destock that we saw parts of last year has played out already to what extent is that a contributing factor ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah id say that the greater share of the increase comes from north america but we also saw growth in our europe business as well jerry revich  goldman sachs  co okay and can you say more about the used truck headwind in the quarter was that marktomarket on outstanding lease residual values can you just flesh that out for us in terms of is there a risk of additional charges on the outstanding lease book ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah that primary relates to trucks that we sell the good news is there was better demand for trucks unfortunately the prices are dampened because of the high quantities of used trucks that are in inventories were seeing from several of our competitors and thats dampening the prices and so i dont – weve not seen any further deterioration in prices but we havent seen an increase either jerry revich  goldman sachs  co and what about the operating leases that you folks have outstanding can you remind us when do you do the impairment test on whether the market value is below the residual value thats recorded for finco ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah we review those every quarter jerry and we mark those to and we adjust the residual values and depreciation accordingly jerry revich  goldman sachs  co okay and there was no adjustment related to the operating lease for this quarter at all ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i dont – i think there was probably a small amount that was included in the first quarter results jerry revich  goldman sachs  co okay all right i appreciate the color thank you ronald e armstrong  paccar inc you bet operator your next question will come from the line of george  of wells fargo unknown speaker hey good morning could you provide us a little bit more color of what youre seeing in regional truck trends and in south america first outside of brazil and then inside of brazil i know  commented that it thought that it was seeing a bottom im wondering if you agree ronald e armstrong  paccar inc well the – i think the south american market will be comparable this year to what we saw last year so we would hope that as brazil sells some of its economic challenges that well see return to growth in that business and a lot of the – the rest of the south america will be dependent on how the mining and commodities develop so i think there is some positive trends in that arena unknown speaker sounds great i know you commented on improved strength in the north american canadian market are you – that you didnt move your forecast at all are you expecting the strength to kind of maintain itself throughout the year or you feel like it will subside in anyway ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i think when we had discussion in january our market range was probably above the average of other estimators and as time has gone on they have increased their market size estimates to be closer to ours so we feel pretty comfortable with our range and if orders continue at the pace we could be at the mid to upper portion of the range unknown speaker that sounds great thank you very much ronald e armstrong  paccar inc you bet operator your next question will come from the line of ann duignan of jpmorgan unknown speaker hi this is kristy  on for ann duignan can you guys describe the environment by end market in north america and where youre seeing orders coming from is it say oil and gas over the longhaul and can you describe by region in the eu and how sustainably you think current orders rates are into the second half of  ronald e armstrong  paccar inc id say were seeing good broadbased order intake across all segments the vocational segment has been steady for several years now and were seeing good order intake from the longhaul side in europe the western europe continues to be strong central europe as well and were seeing some recovery and order intake from the russian market as we begin this year unknown speaker okay thank you i will get back in queue operator your next question will come from the line of seth weber of rbc capital markets emily mclaughlin  rbc capital markets llc hi this is emily mclaughlin on for seth im just wondering do you think that the  you reported for the class  order share is sustainable and is there anything you can point to specifically than if youd be driving the share gains ronald e armstrong  paccar inc our kenworth and peterbilts retail sales share in the second half of last year was roughly   and so i think that order intake share is in line with that the retail sale share in the first quarter was  and so we hope to see that continue at that level or increase as we progress through the year emily mclaughlin  rbc capital markets llc great and then one more im just wondering if youre seeing any notable change in order mix in terms of smaller owner operator versus larger fleets for their class  segment ronald e armstrong  paccar inc no i think its pretty consistent with what weve been seeing now for the last year or so emily mclaughlin  rbc capital markets llc okay great thanks thats all i had ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of tim thein of citigroup timothy w thein  citigroup investment research great thein this is tim yeah good morning ron how youre doing ronald e armstrong  paccar inc good morning tim timothy w thein  citigroup investment research good good hey just coming back to the first question on the financial services im trying to kind of get a better understanding in terms of the increase that call at  million increase in net interest and other line yearoveryear how much of that with is i guess im getting out was this a kind of more onetime impairment or is this – will there be an ongoing impact from higher depreciation or combination of both maybe just a little bit more clarity on that would be helpful ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah so one of the things thats caused – impacting revenues and interest in other is the fact that the mix of our portfolio is a little bit more tilted towards operating leases which have higher revenue and expense per truck associated with them and then we did have on some bulk sales of used trucks in the first quarter thats where we saw the losses that we incurred on some of those sales and so well see how pricing develops but as i can say demand has increased and well monitor prices very closely to see if we can get some better price realization as we go forward timothy w thein  citigroup investment research okay okay and are you able to – i mean at this point maybe provide some more color in terms of the amount of lease returns in your north american financing business in the quarter do you have that ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah that will be in our q when we publish that timothy w thein  citigroup investment research yeah ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah timothy w thein  citigroup investment research okay okay and then i guess maybe just a last one on parts obviously off to a strong start in q are you still expecting to be in that kind of plus  to  range or is it – has the thought process changed in terms of fullyear revenue for parts ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah i think based on the first quarter results probably  to  would be our estimate of how we would see the year progress for parts timothy w thein  citigroup investment research okay okay understood and just close it up on gross margin expectations obviously above the midpoint here in q with – and youre talking about deliveries going up are we still thinking it kind of mid range at the higher end or for the year ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah i think in the  to  range for the year would be the way to think about the rest of the year for us timothy w thein  citigroup investment research got it understood i appreciate it thanks a lot ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of ross gilardi of bank of america merrill lynch ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning guys ronald e armstrong  paccar inc good morning ross ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch sorry to harp on the finco questions but just i guess to expand on what tim was asking i mean in a flattish used truck pricing environment is that  million in finco pretax earnings kind of the inappropriate run rate or should this kind of bounce back to more in line with year ago levels ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i think once we get through the used truck i think well see recovery assume all other things being equal assuming similar interest rate environment et cetera ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch okay so in order to see sort of a step up youve actually got to see a change in earnings for the finco youve got to see a change in market conditions from the sounds of it ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah i think thats fair and as we continue to work with our used truck inventories and well see hopefully that progress as we go through the rest of this year in a positive way ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks and then maybe you could talk just about the truck margin itself as the parts margin was very strong the truck margin was a little bit soft could you help us maybe bridge the yearonyear and maybe just include some comments on sort of pricing and raw material costs ronald e armstrong  paccar inc so when you look at the incremental margin from the fourth quarter incremental margin was  which is basically in line with how we would think about how incremental margins would move quartertoquarter in the  to  range so right in line with how we anticipated it would develop ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch and in terms of pricing versus raw material costs was there anything notable from the uk or with all the currency movements or anything like that which you would highlight ronald e armstrong  paccar inc the pound euro exchange rate continues to be – i guess i would call it a bit of a headwind but were working through that as time goes on and the us and canadian market as we progressed through last year the orders and the retail sales decline and so we ended last year in a more competitive position and were still in that same situation as we began the year this year ross p gilardi  bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of david leiker of robert w baird joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc hey guys this is joe vruwink for david ronald e armstrong  paccar inc good morning joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc sorry to do this one quick one on used price dynamics any impact from mix of what was sold in the quarter youre seeing i would say much more pressure on the sleepers in the market less so on the day cabs did that factor in to what you saw ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i think its pretty pretty evenly across the market i dont think there is any particular impact with sleepers versus day cabs joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc okay and used prices being weak isnt really a new issue for the industry so i guess im struggling a bit with why this is really the first quarter paccar has had an issue just any idea why its popping up for you where your peers have been dealing with it for a while now ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i think its just because of the volume of used trucks we did have increased used truck sales in the quarter and so higher trucks higher used truck sales is the reason its i guess its slightly bigger impact than it has been joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc okay okay shifting to the new market so youve obviously gained a lot of share at the trough of this recent correction it looks like we have an upcycle on the horizon looks like with that upcycle in play q market share in terms of the order book is normalizing a little bit can you maybe help us frame i dont know a peaktopeak market share is the right way to look at it but whats sort of market share paccar would expect as we may be an inch back closer to  unit markets ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thats – our guys are working hard to – like our customers the best trucks and satisfy their needs and we have great products we have great support services and we think that over time that will lead to share improvement as it has for the last  years so being able to predict how thats going to progress quartertoquarter or yeartoyear is a bit challenging joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc maybe on q itself so the whole  and i think we can call q a recovery corridor in order intake is holding  doable because that obviously would represent market share relative to where you have been ronald e armstrong  paccar inc its just dependent on how things develop theres no – we would hope that that  continues but we have competitors in the market and everybody works hard to keep their business moving forward so well see how it develops as we progress through the year joe d vruwink  robert w baird  co inc okay very good thank you ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of steven fisher of ubs cleve rueckert  ubs securities llc hey guys good morning its cleve rueckert on for steve ronald e armstrong  paccar inc good morning cleve rueckert  ubs securities llc just a followup on the q orders strength do you guys have a color on how that developed from a customer perspective i mean how much was energy versus construction versus over the road is there any shift going on there ronald e armstrong  paccar inc probably the – the biggest increase was probably the over the road like i said vocational has been pretty steady we did see some improvement in vocational but as a percent of total the increase in orders i think comes a lot from the on highway customers and we are seeing some some recovery in the energy segment but its pretty early days for that cleve rueckert  ubs securities llc okay thats helpful thanks and then just a quick one can you reconcile the lower european revenues with the higher volumes say on a yearoveryear basis whats driving that small divergence there unknown speaker there is a couple of factors on that one one as we have – when we do residual value it guarantees in europe we account for those as operating leases so we differ the revenues so there is a truck delivery but the revenue gets deferred and amortized over time and we had a higher number of those operating lease activities in europe during the quarter compared to last quarter so that accounted for about  million or so of the difference plus the pound and the euro were both lower against the us dollar compared to last year cleve rueckert  ubs securities llc okay so its nothing to do with pricing there ronald e armstrong  paccar inc no unknown speaker no actually pricing was up a bit as some prices were increased to reflect the effective pound versus the euro in uk cleve rueckert  ubs securities llc okay thats it from me thanks very much ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of joel tiss of bank of montreal john joyner  bmo capital markets united states hey this is john joyner in for joel ronald e armstrong  paccar inc good morning john joyner  bmo capital markets united states so i guess youre getting – good morning a lot of b teams today so just real quick on finco again and i know this amount is absolutely dollar amount is not big but when you look at the provision for losses i wonder that i guess nearly double from a year ago ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i mean the provision for loss is at historically low levels i think last year if you look at the elements of the change in the reserve the level of credit losses is very similar this year we had an increase in the provision last year we had a decrease in the provision and that just reflects movements in portfolios in the various geographies and as you said its a relatively small impact and so if the portfolio continues to perform very well past dues had been at below  for almost four or five years now so its purely just small numbers john joyner  bmo capital markets united states got it and just maybe one more i mean can you talk a little bit about your products i know over the past couple of years you and another of your competitors have been rolling out new products and kind of a refresh of the portfolio and can you maybe talk about any traction thats being gained or where you see strong customer uptake versus your competitors because kind of all you hear is that oh every product is gaining share and obviously that cant necessarily be the case ronald e armstrong  paccar inc well we have great product and weve launched the  meter products here in north america that percentage of build has continued to increase and currently were at about  of kenworth and peterbilt heavy duty truck build or the newer models very well received performing excellently we launched and we included the update to the  mx engine in those trucks at the beginning of this year adding another  to  of fuel efficiency so the trucks are performing great and very well received by the customers and just this morning our daf team launched their newest xf model at the birmingham truck show which basically incorporates all the engine enhancements that we adopted here in north america into the daf product as well as some additional chassis and cab changes that improved aerodynamics and fuel efficiency up to about a  improvement so we just continue to move the needle forward on our products and customers really appreciate the lowest total cost of ownership when you combine the low operating costs with the strong residual values it makes for a good value proposition for our customers john joyner  bmo capital markets united states okay thank you very much ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of mike baudendistel from stifel michael j baudendistel  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey thank you thank you just wanted to ask you on the parts segment i think you said you have  existing parts distribution facilities and youre opening a couple more that are  or  can you just frame that for us as what percentage increase in parts distribution capacity that represents ronald e armstrong  paccar inc so i think we roughly have about  million of square feet in parts distribution center space around the world so were going to increase the – we increased the distribution capacity here in washington at our renton facility by about  square feet and were going to increase the distribution capacity in toronto by another  square feet when we finish construction of that next year so as we look forward our parts team has really clear view of continuing to increment that capacity as the parts business grows and so that kind of pace per year i think youll see going forward michael j baudendistel  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and your forecast for growth in parts of  to  this year if you view that as a normalized rate or somewhat of a muted rate given the environment that you think will accelerate back to the prior growth rate of  or  ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i think thats what were expecting at this point whether thats – just how we see the development of the market for us globally michael j baudendistel  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and also just want to ask you on one of the topics of the hour there was a lot of media attention given to a certain tweet about from a certain company that does electric vehicles that theyre planning to have a prototype out of a semielectric semitruck this fall and wanted to ask you since you occupy sort of the premium end of the marketplace on class  trucks do you view an electric truck as a credible threat longerterm if we were to think out  years ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah longerterm  years i think thats the kind of timeframe and were working on electric trucks hybrid electric hydrogen fuelcell natural gas i mean were investing in all alternative fuel strategies to be prepared for what may come so nobody is standing still and everybodys – i cant say everybody i guess were certainly focused on being prepared for market dynamics and market transitions as they occur michael j baudendistel  stifel nicolaus  co inc sounds great thanks very much ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of barry haimes of sage asset barry george haimes  sage asset management lp thanks very much yeah i have one followup on the financial services so if youre marketing used trucks to market every quarter and if used truck prices stayed flat sequentially why wouldnt the financial services profit move up sequentially as well as opposed to it seemed like you indicated that it would be sort of a gradual improvement as we went through the year but why wouldnt you see that improvement sequentially right away ronald e armstrong  paccar inc in the accounting rules the marktomarket is based on a onetruck transaction and we sell used trucks and typically multiples of that and so a larger sale typically has some discounting pricing that goes with that barry george haimes  sage asset management lp okay thanks and then one question on another topic the class  orders i think by most accounts have come in better than folks expected over the last several months and in spite of the fact that truckload rates has been pretty soft so im wondering if you have any thoughts as to why you think the orders have been better is it that the few economy gap is so large or are there some other factors that might account for the better tone and in spite of the fact that truckload profitability isnt so great thanks so much ronald e armstrong  paccar inc net truck load profitability i mean its down from maybe the peak but its still pretty good and we see that in our finance portfolio customers have no problem servicing their truck payments so i think there is – as is in any year were starting to see the age of the fleet creepup a bit and so there are just more customers who are probably getting to the point where it makes sense to take advantage of the additional investment to fuel efficiency that comes with the latest versions of heavyduty trucks barry george haimes  sage asset management lp thank you ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of alex potter of piper jaffray alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co hi guys just wanted to ask another maybe a longer term thematic strategic question this time regarding selfdriving vehicles obviously its another area of intense media interest recently just wondering if you could give an update on what your strategy is there if its changed at all over the last  months to  months and i dont know if you would consider acquisitions partnerships organic development just any color you can provide will be helpful ronald e armstrong  paccar inc one of the things that weve done and weve seen over the last  months really  months is the software controls that are in our vehicles are becoming ever more important and weve increased our engineering resources particularly in the software area and so i think well continue to see that as we progress over the coming years and with some of those resources dedicated to developing autonomous vehicle technologies there is a lot of things that have to happen for autonomous trucks to become a reality but weve had platooning demonstrations weve had autonomous truck demonstrations so were involved and engaged in that in a big way and well continue to make investments in that arena as we go through this year and for the next five years  years so were working closely with a lot of different parties in the industry and so well continue to develop our capability alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co okay great and then one last question you had mentioned earlier the impact of the pound moving around and the oems having to increase pricing in the uk in order to make up for that just wondering if youve seen any pushback or if the market seems capable of absorbing that increase in pricing ronald e armstrong  paccar inc id say its a gradual process it just takes time and weve been – weve done this before and it just takes a while for it to work its way through the system alexander eugene potter  piper jaffray  co okay good to hear thanks ronald e armstrong  paccar inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of neil frohnapple of longbow research faheem f sabeiha  longbow research llc sorry hi good morning this is actually faheem on the line for neil and im just wondering whats your – what was the mx installation rate in the quarter in the kenworth and peterbilt trucks in north america ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i believe its  for the first quarter yes faheem f sabeiha  longbow research llc okay sounds great and can you remind whats your outlook is for the mx market share in  ronald e armstrong  paccar inc i think look we were  last year our target is to be at  or so this year faheem f sabeiha  longbow research llc okay and as far as the bulk used truck sales that you mentioned in the first quarter were those to like a particular dealer group or were those to fleets ronald e armstrong  paccar inc sum of both faheem f sabeiha  longbow research llc both ronald e armstrong  paccar inc yeah faheem f sabeiha  longbow research llc okay and as far as the class  order increase in the first quarter i mean was that a little more to end users or did you see an increase in dealer stock orders ronald e
