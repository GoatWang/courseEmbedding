reaction that entails the redistribution of fragments of alkenes olefins by the scission and regeneration of carboncarbon double bonds catalysts for this reaction have evolved rapidly for the past few decades because of the relative simplicity of olefin metathesis it often creates fewer undesired byproducts and hazardous wastes than alternative organic reactions for their elucidation of the reaction mechanism and their discovery of a variety of highly efficient and selective catalysts yves chauvin robert h grubbs and richard r schrock were collectively awarded the  nobel prize in chemistry contents  catalysts  applications  types of olefin metathesis processes  reaction mechanism  historical overview  grubbs catalysts  schrock catalysts  references  further reading  see also catalystsedit the reaction is catalyzed by metal complexes traditional catalysts are prepared by a reaction of the metal halides with alkylation agents for example wcl–etoh–etalcl the traditional industrial catalysts are illdefined and used mainly for petroleum products modern catalysts are welldefined organometallic compounds that come in two main categories commonly known as schrock catalysts and grubbs catalysts schrock catalysts are molybdenumiv and tungstenivbased and are examples of schrock alkylidenes grubbs catalysts on the other hand are rutheniumii carbenoid complexes grubbs catalysts are often modified with a chelating isopropoxystyrene ligand to form the related hoveyda–grubbs catalyst applicationsedit olefin metathesis was first commercialized in petroleum reformation for the synthesis of higher olefins from the products alphaolefins from the shell higher olefin process shop under high pressure and high temperatures modern catalysts can be used for a variety of specialized organic compounds and monomers modern applications include the synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs macrocyclic crownophanes the manufacturing of highstrength materials the production of propylene the preparation of cancertargeting nanoparticles and the conversion of renewable plantbased feedstocks into hair and skin care products types of olefin metathesis processesedit some important classes of olefin metathesis include cross metathesis cm ringopening metathesis rom ringclosing metathesis rcm ringopening metathesis polymerisation romp acyclic diene metathesis admet ethenolysis reaction mechanismedit hérisson and chauvin first proposed the widely accepted mechanism of transition metal alkene metathesis the direct  cycloaddition of two alkenes is formally symmetry forbidden and thus has a high activation energy the chauvin mechanism involves the  cycloaddition of an alkene double bond to a transition metal alkylidene to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate the metallacyclobutane produced can then cyclorevert to give either the original species or a new alkene and alkylidene interaction with the dorbitals on the metal catalyst lowers the activation energy enough that the reaction can proceed rapidly at modest temperatures like most chemical reactions the metathesis pathway is driven by a thermodynamic imperative that is the final products are determined by the energetics of the possible products with a distribution of products proportional to the exponential of their respective energy values in olefin metathesis however this is especially relevant since all the possible products have similar energy values all of them contain an olefin because of this the product mixture can be tuned by reaction conditions such as gas pressure and substrate concentration in some cases a given reaction can be run in either direction to near completion cross metathesis and ringclosing metathesis are often driven by the entropically favored evolution of ethylene or propylene which are both gases because of this cm and rcm reactions often use alphaolefins the reverse reaction of cm of two alphaolefins ethenolysis can be favored but requires high pressures of ethylene to increase ethylene concentration in solution the reverse reaction of rcm ringopening metathesis can likewise be favored by a large excess of an alphaolefin often styrene ring opening metathesis usually involves a strained alkene often a norbornene and the release of ring strain drives the reaction ringclosing metathesis conversely usually involves the formation of a five or sixmembered ring which is energetically favorable although these reactions tend to also evolve ethylene as previously discussed rcm has been used to close larger macrocycles in which case the reaction may be kinetically controlled by running the reaction at extreme dilutions the same substrates that undergo rcm can undergo acyclic diene metathesis with admet favored at high concentrations the thorpe–ingold effect may also be exploited to improve both reaction rates and product selectivity crossmetathesis is synthetically equivalent to and has replaced a procedure of ozonolysis of an alkene to two ketone fragments followed by the reaction of one of them with a wittig reagent historical overviewedit known chemistry prior to the advent of olefin metathesis was introduced in the s by karl ziegler who as part of ongoing work in what would later become known as ziegler–natta catalysis studied ethylene polymerization which on addition of certain metals resulted in butene instead of a saturated longchain hydrocarbon see nickel effect in  a du pont research group polymerized norbornene to polynorbornene using lithium aluminum tetraheptyl and titanium tetrachloride a patent by this company on this topic dates back to  a reaction then classified as a socalled coordination polymerization according to the then proposed reaction mechanism a rtix titanium intermediate first coordinates to the double bond in a pi complex the second step then is a concerted sni reaction breaking a cc bond and forming a new alkylidenetitanium bond the process then repeats itself with a second monomer only much later the polynorbornene was going to be produced through ring opening metathesis polymerisation the dupont work was led by herbert s eleuterio giulio natta in  also observed the formation of an unsaturated polymer when polymerizing cyclopentene with tungsten and molybdenum halides in a third development leading up to olefin metathesis researchers at phillips petroleum company in  described olefin disproportionation with catalysts molybdenum hexacarbonyl tungsten hexacarbonyl and molybdenum oxide supported on alumina for example converting propylene to an equal mixture of ethylene and butene for which they proposed a reaction mechanism involving a cyclobutane they called it a quasicyclobutane – metal complex this particular mechanism is symmetry forbidden based on the woodward–hoffmann rules first formulated two years earlier cyclobutanes have also never been identified in metathesis reactions which is another reason why it was quickly abandoned then in  researchers at the goodyear tire and rubber company described a novel catalyst system for the metathesis of pentene based on tungsten hexachloride ethanol the organoaluminum compound etalme and also proposed a name for this reaction type olefin metathesis formerly the reaction had been called olefin disproportionation in this reaction pentene forms a rapid a matter of seconds chemical equilibrium with butene and hexene no double bond migrations are observed the reaction can be started with the butene and hexene as well and the reaction can be stopped by addition of methanol the goodyear group demonstrated that the reaction of regular butene with its alldeuterated isotopologue yielded chd with deuterium evenly distributed in this way they were able to differentiate between a transalkylidenation mechanism and a transalkylation mechanism ruled out in  chauvin proposed a fourmembered metallacycle intermediate to explain the statistical distribution of products found in certain metathesis reactions this mechanism is today considered the actual mechanism taking place in olefin metathesis the active catalyst a metallocarbene was discovered by in  by e o fischer chauvins experimental evidence was based on the reaction of cyclopentene and pentene with the homogeneous catalyst tungstenvi oxytetrachloride and tetrabutyltin the three principal products c c and c are found in a  regardless of conversion the same ratio is found with the higher oligomers chauvin also explained how the carbene forms in the first place by alphahydride elimination from a carbon metal single bond for example propylene c forms in a reaction of butene c with tungsten hexachloride and tetramethyltin c in the same year pettit who synthesised cyclobutadiene a few years earlier independently came up with a competing mechanism it consisted of a tetramethylene intermediate with sp hybridized carbon atoms linked to a central metal atom with multiple threecenter twoelectron bonds experimental support offered by pettit for this mechanism was based on an observed reaction inhibition by carbon monoxide in certain metathesis reactions of nonene with a tungsten metal carbonyl robert h grubbs got involved in metathesis in  and also proposed a metallacycle intermediate but one with four carbon atoms in the ring the group he worked in reacted dilithiobutane with tungsten hexachloride in an attempt to directly produce a cyclomethylenemetallacycle producing an intermediate which yielded products identical with those produced by the intermediate in the olefin metathesis reaction this mechanism is pairwise in  grubbs found further evidence for this mechanism by isolating one such metallacycle not with tungsten but with platinum by reaction of the dilithiobutane with cisbistriphenylphosphinedichloroplatinumii in  katz also arrived at a metallacyclobutane intermediate consistent with the one proposed by chauvin he reacted a mixture of cyclooctene butene and octene with a molybdenum catalyst and observed that the unsymmetrical c hydrocarbon reaction product is present right from the start at low conversion in any of the pairwise mechanisms with olefin pairing as ratedetermining step this compound a secondary reaction product of c with c would form well after formation of the two primary reaction products c and c in  casey was the first to implement carbenes into the metathesis reaction mechanism grubbs in  provided evidence against his own updated pairwise mechanism with a membered cycle in another round of isotope labeling studies in favor of the membered cycle chauvin mechanism in this reaction the ethylene product distribution ddd at low conversion was found to be consistent with the carbene mechanism on the other hand grubbs did not rule out the possibility of a tetramethylene intermediate the first practical metathesis system was introduced in  by tebbe based on the what later became known as the tebbe reagent in a model reaction isotopically labeled carbon atoms in isobutene and methylenecyclohexane switched places the grubbs group then isolated the proposed metallacyclobutane intermediate in  also with this reagent together with methylbutene they isolated a similar compound in the total synthesis of capnellene in  in that same year the grubbs group proved that metathesis polymerization of norbornene by tebbes reagent is a living polymerization system and a year later grubbs and schrock copublished an article describing living polymerization with a tungsten carbene complex while schrock focussed his research on tungsten and molybdenum catalysts for olefin metathesis grubbs started the development of catalysts based on ruthenium which proved to be less sensitive to oxygen and water and therefore more functional group tolerant grubbs catalystsedit in the s and s various groups reported the ringopening polymerization of norbornene catalyzed by hydrated trichlorides of ruthenium and other late transition metals in polar protic solvents this prompted robert h grubbs and coworkers to search for welldefined functional group tolerant catalysts based on ruthenium the grubbs group successfully polymerized the oxo norbornene derivative using ruthenium trichloride osmium trichloride as well as tungsten alkylidenes they identified a ruii carbene as an effective metal center and in  published the first welldefined rutheniumbased olefin metathesis catalyst pphclruchchcph the corresponding tricyclohexylphosphine complex pcyclruchchcph was also shown to be active this work culminated in the now commercially available st generation grubbs catalyst schrock catalystsedit schrock entered the olefin metathesis field in  as an extension of work on tantalum alkylidenes the initial result was disappointing as reaction of cptachtbucl with ethylene yielded only a metallacyclopentane not metathesis products but by tweaking this structure to a prtachtbuotbucl replacing chloride by tbutoxide and a cyclopentadienyl by an organophosphine metathesis was established with cispentene in another development certain tungsten oxo complexes of the type wochtbuclpet were also found to be effective schrock alkylidenes for olefin metathesis of the type monarchcchr were commercialized starting in  the first asymmetric catalyst followed in  with a schrock catalyst modified with a binol ligand in a norbornadiene romp leading to highly stereoregular cis isotactic polymer referencesedit  astruc d  the metathesis reactions from a historical perspective to recent

a quenching agent is presented the grubbs group successfully polymerized the oxo norbornene derivative using ruthenium trichloride osmium trichloride as well as tungsten alkylidenes they identified a ruii carbene as an effective metal center and in  published the first welldefined rutheniumbased olefin metathesis catalyst pphclruchchcph the corresponding tricyclohexylphosphine complex pcyclruchchcph was also shown to be active this work culminated in the now commercially available st generation grubbs catalyst in  second generation catalysts have been developed as well ruthenium is stable in air and has higher selectivity and lower reactivity than molybdenum the most promising of the previously discovered catalysts in addition grubbs took a green chemistry approach to catalysis that reduced the potential to create hazardous waste grubbs catalyst has become a standard for general metathesis applications in ordinary laboratories by controlling the catalyst used it becomes possible to synthesize polymers with specialized structures and functional capabilities including cyclic olefins alternating copolymers and multiblock copolymers using catalysts allows chemists to speed up chemical transformations and to lower the cost of what were previously complicated multistep industrial processes commercial activitiesedit both first and second generation grubbs catalysts are commercially available from materia a startup company that grubbs cofounded with mike giardello in pasadena california in  materia has been able to obtain exclusive rights to manufacture many of the known olefin catalysts under giardello materia was able to sell their catalysts through sigmaaldrichs chemicals catalogue sigmaaldrich became their exclusive worldwide provider in  materia

february   on a farm in marshall county kentucky midway between possum trot and calvert city his parents were howard and faye grubbs faye grubbs was a schoolteacher after serving in world war ii the family moved to paducah kentucky where howard grubbs trained as a diesel mechanic and robert grubbs attended paducah tilghman high school at the university of florida robert grubbs initially intended to study agriculture however he was convinced by professor merle a battiste to switch to organic chemistry working with battiste grubbs became interested in how chemical reactions occur he received his bs in  and ms in  from the university of florida next grubbs attended columbia university where he worked with ronald breslow on the antiaromaticity of cyclobutadiene this work aroused his interest in metals and organometallic compounds which contain carbonmetal bonds grubbs received his phd in  career and researchedit grubbs worked with james collman at stanford university as a national institutes of health fellow during – with collman he began to systematically investigate catalytic processes in organometallic chemistry a relatively new area of research in  grubbs was then appointed to the faculty of michigan state university where he began his work on olefin metathesis harold hart gerasimos j karabatsos gene legoff don farnum bill reusch and pete wagner served as his early mentors at msu he was an assistant professor from  to  and an associate professor from  to  he received a sloan fellowship for – in  he went to the max planck institute for coal research in mülheim germany on a fellowship from the alexander von humboldt foundation in  grubbs moved to california institute of technology as a professor of chemistry as of  he became the victor and elizabeth atkins professor of chemistry grubbs main research interests are in organometallic chemistry and synthetic chemistry particularly the development of novel catalysts for olefin metathesis in olefin metathesis a catalyst is used to break the bonds of carbon molecules which can then reform to create chemical bonds in new ways producing new compounds with unique properties the basic technique can be used for creation of polymers pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals and has broad applications in areas including pharmaceuticals biotechnology agriculture and plastics grubbs has been instrumental in developing a family of ruthenium catalysts including grubbs catalyst for olefin metathesis he has studied olefin transformations for ringclosing metathesis rcm crossmetathesis reaction cmr and

february   on a farm in marshall county kentucky midway between possum trot and calvert city his parents were howard and faye grubbs faye grubbs was a schoolteacher after serving in world war ii the family moved to paducah kentucky where howard grubbs trained as a diesel mechanic and robert grubbs attended paducah tilghman high school at the university of florida robert grubbs initially intended to study agriculture however he was convinced by professor merle a battiste to switch to organic chemistry working with battiste grubbs became interested in how chemical reactions occur he received his bs in  and ms in  from the university of florida next grubbs attended columbia university where he worked with ronald breslow on the antiaromaticity of cyclobutadiene this work aroused his interest in metals and organometallic compounds which contain carbonmetal bonds grubbs received his phd in  career and researchedit grubbs worked with james collman at stanford university as a national institutes of health fellow during – with collman he began to systematically investigate catalytic processes in organometallic chemistry a relatively new area of research in  grubbs was then appointed to the faculty of michigan state university where he began his work on olefin metathesis harold hart gerasimos j karabatsos gene legoff don farnum bill reusch and pete wagner served as his early mentors at msu he was an assistant professor from  to  and an associate professor from  to  he received a sloan fellowship for – in  he went to the max planck institute for coal research in mülheim germany on a fellowship from the alexander von humboldt foundation in  grubbs moved to california institute of technology as a professor of chemistry as of  he became the victor and elizabeth atkins professor of chemistry grubbs main research interests are in organometallic chemistry and synthetic chemistry particularly the development of novel catalysts for olefin metathesis in olefin metathesis a catalyst is used to break the bonds of carbon molecules which can then reform to create chemical bonds in new ways producing new compounds with unique properties the basic technique can be used for creation of polymers pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals and has broad applications in areas including pharmaceuticals biotechnology agriculture and plastics grubbs has been instrumental in developing a family of ruthenium catalysts including grubbs catalyst for olefin metathesis he has studied olefin transformations for ringclosing metathesis rcm crossmetathesis reaction cmr and ringopening metathesis polymerization romp with cyclic olefins such as norbornene he has also contributed to the development of living polymerization in which the termination ability of a polymerization reaction is removed the polymer will continue to replicate until a quenching agent is presented the grubbs group successfully polymerized the oxo norbornene derivative using ruthenium trichloride osmium trichloride as well as tungsten alkylidenes they identified a ruii carbene as an effective metal center and in  published the first welldefined rutheniumbased olefin metathesis catalyst pphclruchchcph the corresponding tricyclohexylphosphine complex pcyclruchchcph was also shown to be active this work culminated in the now commercially available st generation grubbs catalyst in  second generation catalysts have been developed as well ruthenium is stable in air and has higher selectivity and lower reactivity than molybdenum the most promising of the previously discovered catalysts in addition grubbs took a green chemistry approach to catalysis that reduced the potential to create hazardous waste grubbs catalyst has become a standard for general metathesis applications in ordinary laboratories by controlling the catalyst used it becomes possible to synthesize polymers with specialized structures and functional capabilities including cyclic olefins alternating copolymers and multiblock copolymers using catalysts allows chemists to speed up chemical transformations and to lower the cost of what were previously complicated multistep industrial processes commercial activitiesedit both first and second generation grubbs catalysts are commercially available from materia a startup company that grubbs cofounded with mike giardello in pasadena california in  materia has been able to obtain exclusive rights to manufacture many of the known olefin catalysts under giardello materia was able to sell their catalysts through sigmaaldrichs chemicals catalogue sigmaaldrich became their exclusive worldwide provider in  materia partnered with cargill to form elevance renewable sciences to produce specialty chemicals from renewable oils including biofuels grubbs is a member of the reliance innovation council formed by reliance industries limited india grubbs is a member of the usa science and engineering festivals advisory board awards and honorsedit grubbs received the  nobel prize in chemistry along with richard r schrock and yves chauvin for his work in the field of olefin metathesis he has received a number of other awards and honors as well including the following  national academy of sciences  american academy of arts and sciences  benjamin franklin medal in chemistry from the franklin institute  acs herman f mark polymer
