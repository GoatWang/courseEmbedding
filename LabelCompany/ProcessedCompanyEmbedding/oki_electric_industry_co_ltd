the street causing cuts and bruises that sent her to the emergency room terry knew she needed a new solution to help control her   pound german shepherdalaskan husky named ziggy “i went to the dollar store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen” said silva  “i was pleasantly surprised when it worked so i had a sturdier one made that my dog ziggy loved  he walked by my side and i never had to put any pressure on the new leash” like most inventors who develop their invention terry determined that licensing it to a company with connections at retail would be the best option that’s when she reached out to lambert  lambert to help her design and market her new invention make presentations and negotiate the license deal

have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
