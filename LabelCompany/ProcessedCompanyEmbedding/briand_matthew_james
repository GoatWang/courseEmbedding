midnight and lambasted radio bosses for being out of touch with listenersmanagement exist in their own management bubble…they can only guess at what the audience is like that is why i find it so heart breaking he told radio today the industry magazinemr lester also took a swipe at the bbc suggesting that it undervalues its night time listenersa breakfast show listener is as important as a night time listener especially with the bbc because they all pay the licence fee and so therefore they expect something from the bbc if they pay the licence fee they deserve a serviceradio  host greg james leapt to the defence of mr lester and janice long his yearold after midnight cohost who was also axedjanice and alex are two of the very best broadcasters around…they sound like actual people on the
