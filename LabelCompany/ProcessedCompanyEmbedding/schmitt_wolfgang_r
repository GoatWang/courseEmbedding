wolfgang schmitt five years to weaken a company that others spent decades building into one of americas mostadmired corporations under schmitts watch as chief executive of rubbermaid rbd beginning in late  the wooster ohiobased company has disappointed by almost every measure now rubbermaid is selling itself to newell nwl the purchase price was about  billion or  a share  not much more than the company was worth when schmitt took charge  but it has since fallen to about  a share because newells stock price has declined you wouldve been better off buying tbills five years ago than buying rubbermaid says eric bosshard an analyst with midwest research in cleveland who rates rubbermaid neutral his firm hasnt performed underwriting for the company from january  through september  rubbermaid lost  while the sp  index jumped  its earnings fell  from  to  and return on equity slipped from  to  during the same time certainly schmitt who will become vice chairman of the combined company newell rubbermaid faced stiff challenges when he took the reins of the rubberproduct maker the market for rubbermaids plastic storage bins and dust pans had drastically changed since the golden era of stanley gault the revered general electric ge manager who ran rubbermaid in the s before retiring in  he was tapped to head goodyear tire  rubber gt which he revived prices for resin a key raw material in plastic production soared during schmitts tenure and rubbermaid along with other manufacturers lost pricing power as discounters like walmart wmt demanded better terms we were caught in a vice between higher rawmaterial costs and a downward spiral in pricing says rubbermaid spokeswoman lorrie crum anyone who wants to single out one individual for the external factors in the industry has their head in the sand but some investors and analysts say schmitt failed to react quickly enough to the changing marketplace the company wasnt very responsive or inventive in what they needed to do says michael hamilton a portfolio manager with invista capital management which has been an investor in rubbermaid for over  years they had too many units and too many different products and they lost control of the brand and expenses it comes back to management and how you alter a company to better compete schmitt never tired of tinkering with rubbermaid through one restructuring after another none of which succeeded in sliming down the business fast or far enough in the companys fiscal third quarter ended oct  earnings declined by  to  million or  cents a share compared with  million or  cents a share a year earlier excluding a  million restructuring charge the company earned  million or  cents a share which fell well short of the  cents a share that a survey of first call analysts had expected sales increased  to  million compared with  million last year under schmitts tenure turnover increased sharply his autocratic style created a tense environment where managers feared making mistakes everyone was focused on avoiding his wrath says a former manager who asked not to be named he destabilized the company and surrounded himself with yes people all the entrepreneurial spirit left thats an ironic turn for a company that was founded by entrepreneurs in  thriving through world war ii wooster rubber went public in  and changed its name to rubbermaid two years later it saw sales and earnings grow steadily through the s and s under ceo don noble who started with rubbermaid in  as a temporary associate under gault rubbermaid reached  billion in sales but soon after he left in  the companys fortunes turned its next chief executive walt williams quit after just  months which led to schmitts promotion even a timeline on the companys web site ends two years ago a contender in fortune magazines list of mostadmired companies for several issues rubbermaid was ranked no  the year schmitt became chairman the company slipped from the top  in  with even grander plans in mind schmitt set ambitious goals to increase the companys sales to  billion and become a global enterprise  neither of which has panned out last year rubbermaid had sales of  billion and its international effort has made little progress toward schmitts objective of accounting for  of the companys sales by  in  international sales were just  of the companys total up from  two years earlier his ideas found a rapt audience in the companys board of directors who gave him free reign wolf was very good at catering to the board says the former employee he always had a ready answer for why things werent working but boards are responsible to shareholders not to ceos and in that capacity by some investors opinions the board failed to do its job companies have a tendency to delude themselves says hamilton the investor like other investors who pushed rubbermaid shares up  to  the day the deal was announced hamilton is pleased with the sale given the alternative it beats a stick in the eye he says thursday shares gained  to   but to residents of wooster a town of  people where rubbermaid is one of the largest employers the change in ownership is unsettling theres pride in plastic here where an everything rubbermaid store occupies  square feet downtown and why not rubbermaids been a model corporate citizen building the wayne center for the arts and buying land for a public high school while rubbermaid has said that only about  corporate executives will move to newells headquarters in freeport ill there are concerns about how those relocations will shrink the communitys tax base weve depended on these people says sandra hull executive director of main street wooster an economic development organization we have no concept of what this will truly mean to the town perhaps most painfully the change in ownership leaves a bitter taste for those who spent their lives building the company noble the former ceo who still keeps an office at rubbermaid headquarters laments im sad because we worked so very hard to keep rubbermaid independent if you liked this article you might like uks old economy enodis to debut on big board but compared with other stocks in its
