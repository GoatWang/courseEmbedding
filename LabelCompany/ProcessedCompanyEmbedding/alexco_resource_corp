district in canadas yukon territory historically one of the highest grade silver districts in the world producing more than  million ounces of silver at an average grade of approximately  grams per tonne gt silver alexco commenced commercial production in the keno hill silver district in  producing approximately two million ounces of silver and more than  million pounds of lead and zinc concentrate per year into  when production was suspended in the face of collapsing silver and base metal prices since then alexco has made two significant exploration discoveries and renegotiated a number of third party agreements the flame  moth and bermingham deposit discoveries have added more than  million ounces of silver at an average grade of  gt silver to alexcos indicated resource base in the district these additions have led to a new and expanded multimine production plan reflecting significantly increased resources a longer life and reduced allin sustaining costs in  alexco is focused on moving the district back to an operations startup in the second half of  by initially executing an advanced underground exploration program at its bermingham deposit followed by underground development of the flame  moth deposit along with recommissioning of all surface plant and infrastructure in addition in  alexco will continue with surface exploration programs in proximity to existing resources in anticipation of adding to a growing resource base employing a unique business model alexco also provides minerelated environmental services remediation technologies and

description canadas only primary silver mine long section mining bellekeno began commercial production at the beginning of  and produced about  million ounces of silver during its startup year mine production was approximately  million ounces of silver in the first three quarters of  alexco recently announced an interim suspension of operations at bellekeno in order to decrease costs and reposition the district for longterm sustainable operations significant amounts of lead and zinc are also mined at bellekeno successful exploration in  and  has indicated good potential to replace some of the resource already mined and extend the mine plan once operations are reinitiated an updated recalculation of the resource at bellekeno is anticipated during  it took just three years from initial exploration through permitting construction and development for alexco to put bellekeno into operation a feat rarely seen in the mining industry as a result the companys founders chief executive officer clynt nauman and chief operating officer brad thrall were named the recipients of the  ea scholz award for excellence in mine development this prestigious ame bc award recognized them for their technical skills environmental control expertise and cooperative relationship with the local nacho nyak dun first nation bellekenos initial mine plan was to utilize the cutandfill method of mining however the mine began to transition over to longhole mining once enough field experience with the ground conditions was obtained bellekeno began producing ore from longhole stopes in  which was the first time this mining method was attempted in the history of the district in places where large blocks of ore are identified and the adjoining rock is relatively competent then a longhole mining method is generally the lowestcost mining technique alexco was able to begin using this method with a targeted approach in some areas of the mine successfully lowering costs and increasing production output at bellekeno in the latter part of  milling the processing mill at keno hill has been ramping up toward full capacity over the past two and a half years of operations and in the third quarter of  hit a record average throughput of  tonnes per day the nameplate capacity of the mill is  tonnes per day with the bellekeno mine expected to provide around  to  tonnes per day of feed when in operation the mill located approximately  kilometers from the bellekeno mine uses conventional crushing grinding and flotation processes followed by concentrate and tailings dewatering the tailings are filtered and either used as backfill for the mine or stored in a dry stack tailings facility ensuring the highest environmental integrity at the site the mill produces both lead and zinc concentrates which are transported by truck in specially designed environmentally protective metal pods to alaska shipped by barge to seattle and then taken by truck to a smelter in southern british columbia for treatment and refining flow chart illustrating mineral extraction and milling process silver purchase agreement the bellekeno mine and mill were built at a cost of c million including us million provided by silver wheaton corp as part of its  silver purchase agreement with alexco in return alexco is selling silver wheaton  of the payable silver produced from the keno hill

keno hill silver district properties was its most aggressive to date with more than  meters of surface drilling and about  meters of underground drilling completed the year was without precedent on the exploration front with a  increase announced by the end of  in the districtwide indicated silver resources to  million ounces of indicated silver resource and  million ounces of inferred resource plus more than  million ounces of historical silver resource in early  alexco released new resource calculations for its flame  moth deposit further ramping up the total consolidated silver resource for the district to  million ounces of indicated silver resource and  million ounces of inferred silver resource flame  moth the flame  moth deposit is a new discovery in the keno hill district a target first unearthed by alexcos exploration team in  after thorough interpretation of the districts geological trends the flame  moth is located next to the district processing mill additional positive drill results were announced in january  underscoring the robust nature of the deposit and by the end of january  the flame  moth resource estimate was nearly  million ounces of indicated and  million ounces of inferred silver resource and growing the mineralization here is wider than many of the historical mines in the district comes nearly to the surface and could represent a paradigm change in the type of mining for the district depending upon final results this deposit could potentially lend itself to more economic bulk mining with lower dilution mineralization now extends  meters along strike and  meters down dip while remaining open to the south and east and westerly toward the surface the flame and moth deposit is divided into two zones the lightning and the christal zones southwest and northeast of the mill fault respectively the results from both zones continue to increase the confidence in the flame  moth deposit which could represent the most significant nearterm production growth opportunities in the keno hill district in addition exploration drilling has identified a new discovery similar in appearance to the flame vein about  meters to the westsouthwest of the flame  moth deposit with a single drill hole intersecting  ounces per ton silver over a  meter interval significantly expanding the area of potential mineralization likely related in some manner to the flame  moth deposit in  alexco plans to initiate baseline geotechnical metallurgical and environmental work as well as preliminary engineering on the flame  moth deposit this work is expected to include studies of future potential production options in context with existing mines and other opportunities in the district axu stock price  alexco resource corp stock quote us
