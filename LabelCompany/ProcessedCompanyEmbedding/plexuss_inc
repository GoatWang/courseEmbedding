can be mixed into  ounces of water should slim be added to hot or cold water slim is meant to be a refreshing drink and its best added to cold water we don’t recommend adding slim to hot water as hot water could affect the stability of slim’s green coffee extract making it less effective can you tell me about the new study that was done on plexus slim we wanted to see what slim can really do so we put it through rigorous testing procedures in a highly advanced in vitro study created to mimic the human gastrointestinal system slim’s powerful microbiome activating formula was tested which produced astounding results ◊ here’s what the scientists found increases friendly microbes called akkermansia– a remarkable microbe which positively impacts disrupted metabolism associated with being overweight by  times ◊ increases lactobacillus by  times and bifidobacterium by  times microbes that contribute to your overall health ◊ increases butyrate by up to  and propionate by up to  shortchain fatty acids that help regulate your metabolism ◊ what is the prebiotic in plexus slim and how is it beneficial to me xylooligosaccharides xos slim’s incredible prebiotic is a fiber that friendly microbes love to eat xos has been clinically shown to improve intestinal microflora for enhanced health and wellbeing in a doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled study conducted by researchers at the university of california at los angeles ucla daily doses of xos as low as  gram were found to significantly improve gut microbiota balance promoting growth of more species of good gut microbes while reducing bad microbes thereby promoting intestinal health what is a prebiotic how does it work your gut is full of microbes some of them are good some of them are bad prebiotics are nondigestible fibers that make their way through our digestive system and help good microbes grow and flourish prebiotics are nonabsorbable fibers like fructo xylo and oligosaccharides and inulin which can be found naturally occurring in whole grains chicory root onions leeks fruits and legumes prebiotics act as a fertilizer selectively feeding good microbes in the gut and assisting in their growth this leads to benefits for your overall wellbeing and health nearly everyone needs prebiotics to experience optimal health particularly those who don’t get enough from their diet have we enhanced the high quality of ingredients in plexus slim absolutely the ingredients in the new slim were specifically qualified by our inhouse quality assurance department using worldclass quality standards each material is rigorously tested for purity and potency by plexus worldwide® before ever being selected for use the difference in this handson approach and dedication to ingredient quality ensures that you can feel confident in the purity and potency of slim’s quality ingredients do i need to keep taking plexus slim to keep the microbiome benefits if you stop drinking plexus slim every day the improvements in your gut can start to disappear in as little as a week so it’s best to take slim every day will i experience any side effects when i start drinking plexus slim experiencing side effects of prebiotic supplementation in slim is very unusual however in certain people supplementing with prebiotics could cause temporary gas and bloating one way to avoid this is to begin by taking only a small amount of prebiotic eg a half pack of slim and then gradually increasing your intake over  to  weeks your gut microbes should adapt to prebiotic supplementation over time which will help relieve any discomfort is there a clinical study on plexus slim for weight loss yes plexus slim has been scientifically demonstrated to promote weight loss in a doubleblind placebocontrolled randomized study of  subjects slim helped study participants lose weight what is the difference between the original slim and the new slim as much as we loved the original slim we love the new slim

   wl  tarl robinson chief executive officerplexus worldwide inc n greenway hayden loopscottsdale az  dear mr robinson this is to advise you that the us food and drug administration fda reviewed your website at the internet address wwwplexusworldwidecom in april and july  and has determined that you take orders there for the products fast relief probio and biocleanse which the website promotes for conditions that cause these products to be drugs under section gb of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § gb the therapeutic claims on your website establish that your products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease as explained further below introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the act you may find the act and fda regulations through links on fda’s home page at wwwfdagov examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include  fast relief “nerve damage is present to some degree in most cases of chronic pain especially neck and back pain nerve damage can occur due to trauma medication side effects or other metabolic issues” “features  benefits…may reduce the associated symptoms from nerve damage of pain numbness tingling ‘pins and needles’ sensations and weakness” probio probio will typically provide the following results…jock itch migraine headaches recurring cystitisvaginal infections…” bio cleanse “why do you need plexus biocleanse many people are in a low oxygentoxic state…viruses bacteria fungi and other pathogenic microbes thrive in this condition and can lead to disease such as flu candida chronic fatigue etc   plexus biocleanse can increase the oxygen levels around these microbes causing them to die due to their highoxygenated environment” your fast relief probio and biocleanse are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and therefore the products are “new drugs” under section p of the act  usc § p new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from fda as described in section a of the act  usc § a see also section d of the act  usc § d the fda approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective furthermore your fast relief probio and biocleanse are offered for conditions that are not amenable to selfdiagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners therefore adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes thus these drugs are misbranded under section f of the act  usc § f in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use the introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is a violation of section a of the act  usc § a the violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an allinclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products you are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations it is your responsibility to ensure that all products marketed by your firm comply with all requirements of federal law and fda regulations you should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice including without limitation seizure and injunction  within fifteen  working days of receipt of this letter please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations as well as copies of related documentation if you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction  please submit your response to nancy schmidt
