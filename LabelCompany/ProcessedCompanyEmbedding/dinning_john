equipment look for a pot rack pullout cabinet drawers or a rolling kitchen cart buy dinnerware and silverware that fits every occasionformal dinnerware is great for holidays but it’s rarely used which means it’s probably not worth the space it takes up try to find something that suits your daily life — you can always spruce up your table using table linens crystal serveware and other tabletop decor
