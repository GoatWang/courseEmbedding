teaching ideas based on new york times content see all in us history » see all lesson plans » overview  what was howard zinn’s approach to history and what values are inherent in it what issues does his work raise about the purpose and significance of studying history what are the benefits and drawbacks of his method in this lesson students examine mr zinn’s work by comparing his writing with a typical american history textbook they then write a reflection or select a document from american history to perform materials  student journals projection equipment or handouts copies of relevant portions of “a people’s history of the united states” and a history textbook warmup  provide the following two questions for students to respond to in their journals in writing history what do you think should be a historian’s goals why do you think people should study history when students are finished writing invite them to share their ideas and record them on the board next hand out project andor read aloud the following quotation from howard zinn’s “a people’s history of the united states” i don’t want to invent victories for people’s movements but to think that historywriting must aim simply to recapitulate the failures that dominate the past is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat if history is to be creative to anticipate a possible future without denying the past it should i believe emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past when even if in brief flashes people showed their ability to resist to join together occasionally to win i am supposing or perhaps only hoping that our future may be found in the past’s fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare that being as blunt as i can is my approach to the history of the united states the reader may as well know the before going on ask how would you paraphrase this historian’s approach to united states history what does he seem to value and why what does he seem to think the purpose and function of history is how does this approach seem similar to and different from how you have studied history in school what are the connections between what you wrote earlier in your journals and these ideas tell students the source of the quotation and that they will take a closer look at the work and philosophy of this historian howard zinn and the controversy over his approach related  in the obituary “howard zinn historian is dead at ” michael powell notes that mr zinn’s book “a people’s history of the united states was a “bestseller that inspired a generation of high school and college students to rethink american history” almost an oddity at first with a printing of just  in  “a people’s history of the united states” has sold nearly two million copies to describe it as a revisionist account is to risk understatement a conventional historical account held no allure he concentrated on what he saw as the genocidal depredations of christopher columbus the blood lust of theodore roosevelt and the racial failings of abraham lincoln he also shined an insistent light on the revolutionary struggles of impoverished farmers feminists laborers and resisters of slavery and war such stories are more often recounted in textbooks today they were not at the time questions  for discussion and reading comprehension what does it mean that howard zinn “delighted … in lancing what he considered platitudes not the least that american history was a heroic march toward democracy” why did the book meet with some skepticism and opposition how did mr zinn respond to critics how has mr zinn and his work penetrated popular culture why do you think that is how do you think mr zinn’s life might have contributed to his worldview and historical approach and vice versa why what “personal philosophy” do you think is expressed in the title of mr zinn’s memoir “you can’t be neutral on a moving train” how do you think the way you study history is different from how it was taught to your parents and grandparents related resources from the learning network lesson i cannot tell a lie lesson ‘whitewashing’ history lesson from concrete to memory scrapbooking the berlin wall from nytimescom times topics howard zinn times topics history oped column “a radical treasure” around the web history matters america’s social history project howard zinnorg activity  explain that students will now examine howard zinn’s approach to history writing by comparing a subject in a typical american history textbook with mr zinn’s portrayal of the same event in his book “a people’s history of the united states” you could use any topic for this lesson depending on your current curriculum by simply looking through the index of “a people’s history of the united states” the example here is about shays’ rebellion to begin hand out the following textbook account of shays’ rebellion from the middle schoollevel united states history textbook “the american nation” by james west davidson and john e batchelor prentice hall  and read it out loud with the class while congress dealt successfully with the northwest territory it failed to solve other problems among the most serious were the problems of farmers during the revolution the demand for farm products was high farmers borrowed money for land seed animals and tools but after the war the nation suffered an economic depression an economic depression is a period when business activity slows prices and wages fall and unemployment rises when prices for farm goods fell farmers could not repay their loans farmers in western massachusetts were hard hit by falling farm prices to make matters worse massachusetts raised taxes the courts threatened to seize the farms of people who did not pay their loans and taxes captain daniel shays was a massachusetts farmer who had fought in the revolution in  shays gathered a force of about  angry farmers they attacked courthouses and tried to take a warehouse full of rifles and gunpowder massachusetts quickly raised an army and ended the rebellion shays’ rebellion worried many americans it was a sign that the articles of confederation were not working leaders of several states called for a convention to discuss ways of reforming the articles they decided to meet in philadelphia in may  when they met however they took more drastic action after they read this account ask students to read the same subject from a history web site like this one or this one after reading these two sources students work individually or in pairs to write a short summary of what happened during shays’ rebellion invite a few students or pairs to share their summary with the class next hand out mr zinn’s account of shays’ rebellion from “a people’s history of the united states” and read it out loud with the class it is available online here but this version may contain some typos as the site’s disclaimer notes you may wish to use a print copy of the book with your class after the class finishes reading both accounts ask pairs to compare and contrast mr zinn’s account with the textbook versions questions for consideration include these what are similarities and differences between the passages what do you make of these differences what characters does mr zinn introduce that the textbook and summaries do not mention what significant perspectives or information may have been left out of each passage do you feel that either of the passages offered a more adequate retelling of this event if so which one explain how reading historical accounts influences your understanding what did you take away from the textbook passage what did you take away from mr zinn’s account when would a simple textbook passage be most helpful when would it be more useful to read an account like those in “a people’s history” in what ways does mr zinn’s account of shays’ rebellion relate to the quotation about his approach to writing history that we read at the beginning of class why do you think an account like mr zinn’s could make some historians and readers dismiss him why do you think that the way mr zinn approaches history led to some historians to dismiss him and brand him a “radical” to take this further you might share one or both of the following a transcript of an interview with howard zinn from wbur in which he connects the story of shays’ rebellion to presentday america “we could learn from that history because people are being foreclosed they’re losing their homes instead of waiting for the president and congress to act who are very slow to act and who are not going to really represent the interests of these poor people or even middle class people who are evicted from homes people should be organizing doing what citizens have done doing what democracy requires to prevent these evictions from taking place” invite students to consider that comparison further for similarities and differences in circumstance context and so on bob herbert’s oped column “a radical treasure” in which he questions why mr zinn was often characterized as a radical and why he considered himself one discuss with students what the term “radical” means and how and why it might and might not apply to mr zinn they might also read some more of mr herbert’s columns to compare and contrast mr herbert’s and mr zinn’s work and approach to documenting the people and events of the united states can you find any evidence in mr herbert’s columns of mr zinn’s philosophy would you call mr herbert a radical why or why not going further  students revisit their warmup writing and discussion by reexploring the question of how history should be “told” in a written piece that explores some of the following questions what power and responsibility does a historian have in telling a story is there a way to write history completely objectively or do historians always add some form of personal bias how does a concentration on “the people” make mr zinn’s version of history different than an emphasis on say politics economics or foreign relations do you think a voice like mr zinn’s is an essential part of the historical record is it important in your opinion that historians use primary sources in their exploration of history why or why not how do you most like to learn about history why alternatively or additionally students watch some of “the people speak” and read the corresponding texts they then create their own video or performance piece on the document of their choice from american history hold a classroom “people speak” contest in which students enter video animated projects raps theater pieces etc perform and share the pieces at a community event or for other classrooms in the school they then reflect on how this experience brought the texts “to life” for them in a new way standards  from mcrel for grades  language arts  uses the general skills and strategies of the reading process  uses reading skills and strategies to understand and interpret a variety of informational texts historical understanding  understands and knows how to analyze chronological relationships and patterns  understands the historical perspective grades k history  understands how democratic values came to be and how they have been exemplified by people events and symbols comments are no longer being accepted jared c bernstein february   ·  pm ugh the first activity suggests comparing a  word passage in a dry textbook to  words of polemic analysis many of zinn’s angles and facts are indeed good to know about but there are other wellwritten longer treatments of the material that would not conflate readerfriendly analysis with anachronistic tubthumping that feeds a contemporary political agenda william murphy february   ·  pm one major flaw of zinn’s history is the lack of foot or end notes this failing should disqualify the work for any serious student of history another caveat is zinn’s history covers minorities and movements but sometimes to the exclusion of broader developments such as the increasing democracy in the country from  to  it is a good adjunct to a history of the us but should not be the main text michael r february   ·  am dinah and holly – thank you for creating this valuable and thoughtful lesson as a social studies teacher another resource i’ve found invaluable is the zinn education project website httpzinnedprojectorg zep has dozens of teaching activities and similar resources – organized by time period and theme – to teach a people’s history in addition dr zinn recently responded to questions from teachers and it is available at httpwwwzinnedprojectorgposts it too provides additional insight into his life and work as well as great advice for social studies teachers brenda c february   ·  pm thanks for taking the time after howard’s passing for including this thoughtful lesson and especially for including howard’s last work the film the people speak httpwwwthepeoplespeakcom michael r’s is right the zinn education project has terrific materials for many different age groups and students around the country are also putting on readings from zinn’s voices of a people’s history of the united states the primary source companion to a people’s history performance and reading out loud is a great way to bring history to life for students there are online organizing tools and scripts at httpwwwpeopleshistoryus noone february   ·  pm as a teachertutor i object to the constant thread of polemics in zinn and his lack of references we are to take his assertions about history as gospel because he says so frankly i think he is the genesis of the movement that condemns anything american michael february   ·  am the zinn piece is just too long my students could not get through all of it my classes are only  minutes and i don’t teach at stuyvesant can’t the times create something for for lack of a better term average students cahtse february   ·  am to all the critics of zinn re endnotes polemics i see zinn as more of a jumping off point his perspective is one that is more of a wider vision of american history that has generally been left out of other treatments for example zinn’s historical work is inclusive of indigenous people the impact of indigenous people in a larger framework and goes beyond “official” or “big man” history that is delves into subtexts left out of the history of big events like wars etc and “big men” theories of history socalled “top down” history that use a central big event and the central leaders presidents kings industrial leaders social movement leaders etc and describes surrounding or contemporary events in the context of or through the “lense” of the major players events and officials zinn was a vanguard of “social history” more or less positing that change occurs from the bottom up from the grass roots by viewing from such a perspective a deeper richer more comprehensive understanding of history a truer and more realistic and more inclusive history “a people’s history” is attained is he a polemicist from certain pespectives of course but that does not serve as meaningful enough criticism to dismiss his work as for the endnotes the primary and secondary material that is grounds for his writings widely exists it’s not as if these events have not been written about by others don’t take zinn’s word for it do your own research bonnie britt february   ·  am william murphy alleges a lack of references in zinn’s “a people’s history” i suspect mr murphy neglected to read the  pages of bibliography that precisely identifies sources chapter by chapter in the page text in the  edition dr zinn identified the authors and book titles directly in the text and includes the full information for each in the bibliography he placed asterisks next to those he found indispensable and said the quotes in the text were found in those marked with asterisks he identified the scholarly journals and “less orthodox but important” periodicals he reviewed before writing mr murphy also complains that what zinn chose to write about sometimes excludes “broader developments such as the increasing democracy in the country from  to ” we know that “increasing democracy” excluded fully half the adult population women until several centuries later along with many other broad sections of the population– including native americans african americans asian americans and others — also until several centuries later when three quarters of the population–or more– is denied voting rights whatever amount of democracy increased between  and did not include the majority of people living within the united states jonathan bowman march   ·  am the zinn education project has no place in any school and here’s why  it’s full of half truths innacuracies and flat out lies “people’s history” is not only boring marxist propagandizing it’s not even well researched he gets so much basic stuff wrong because he’s so busy trying to convince you he’s right he just overlooks things or flat out puts things in there that aren’t correct it seems the writers he reccomends do the same…shay’s rebellion raided an arsenal full of “rifles” is that so any military historian would scoff at that and tell you the clear difference between a rifle and a musket  zinn’s education project is flat out illegal according to most education codes he tells the teachers to disregard this and fight a “guerilla war” against administrators to all the teachers who think that little game is fun guess what zinn and his ilk don’t care if you get fired or suspended they just want to make a point at your expense…useful tools whats next loading previous post grammys fillin next post word of the day
