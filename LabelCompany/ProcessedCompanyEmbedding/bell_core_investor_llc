plus in today’s environment” said bill sirakos senior executive vice president and capital markets division head at frost bank in san antonio texas  “the potential for growth in the use of the afx is quite high both among commercial banks as well as eventually today’s commercial paper issuers” cboe will operate the webaccessible secure electronic trade matching engine and will also support
