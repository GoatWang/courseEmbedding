release please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to mitchell feiger please go ahead mitchell feiger okay thank you austin good morning everyone and thanks for joining us again today i think this morning randy is going to lead off our call providing the detail that you need to better understand our recent operating performance then ill make an attempt to put a strategic context around that performance and lastly as usual we’ll make a valiant attempt to answer every one of your questions so randy randall conte thanks mitch and good morning everyone so im going to jump right in since i’d like to highlight some specific items that we tried to call out in our release but i wanted to make sure you got my perspective as well as a little more detail so operating earnings for the second quarter were  million and the operating earnings per common share were  this was a  decrease from the  per share in q on its face and deserves some explanation so first of all the  million increase in provision which was entirely associated with our loan growth in the quarter in excess of loan growth in q had a  impact on our operating earnings per common share increased tax expense of  million in the quarter resulting from a reduction in the tax benefit recorded on our stockbased compensation had a  impact on our operating earnings per common share and a  million decrease in promotional income in our leasing segment which is lumpy each quarter had a  impact on our operating earnings per common share these negative items were offset by  million increase in net interest income which had a positive  impact on our operating earnings per common share the net result of these items is a negative  impact which is the difference between the two quarters although not an increase from q this is not the big decline shown on the face of our earnings release especially when one considers the excellent loan growth and the impact that the growth will have in our future the continued outstanding credit quality the growth in our net interest margin which is in line with our guidance as i will explain a little later the wellcontrolled core noninterest expense which is also in line with our guidance and expectations lets talk a little bit more about our net interest margin which increased  basis points to  excluding accretion our earning asset yields were up  basis points almost entirely due to the increased interest rates the impact of our loan growth had a more limited impact on net interest margin as much of our growth was late in the quarter prepayment penalties and reaccruals of interest income associated with loans coming out of nonaccrual status where the lowest they’ve been in the last eight plus quarters they were  million of the average this quarter which was a  basis point impact on our net interest margin that’s a good thing however the average cost of funds was up  basis points as a result of an unfavorable shift in our liability mix and increased rates in interest sensitive deposits in wholesale funds specifically although we had solid growth in low cost deposits of approximately  million in the quarter that growth was far short of our loan growth which resulted in a  million increase in shortterm borrowings with a weighted average cost of  at june  additionally we have experienced increasing pricing pressure in our marketplace as more customers are starting to react to rising interest rates in q mitch highlighted deposit growth is one of the biggest issues facing banks are size and how right it was growing low cost deposit it is strategic priority for us in our banking segment as this is the pursue to customers and business opportunities that key type balances of low cost deposits our prepaid card business is a great example of this with noninterest bearing deposits of over  million as of june  loan growth already highlighted but its worth repeating was  million in the quarter with over  million from our commercial businesses spread nicely across a middle market ci specialty lending commercial real estate leasing and assetbased lending businesses residential real estate loans increased as well by  million pointtopoint and our in direct loans were up  million we do not expect residential real estate loans to grow at this pace in the second half of the year expectation is for the growth to be well below  million in future quarters credit quality continues to be excellent and nearly all fronts with no issues to know in the quarter and earlier in my comments i mentioned that i wanted to go a little deeper on expenses so i’m going to do that now on the surface core and noninterest expense after adjusting for merger and repositioning expenses has grown by approximately  as compared to last quarter but this is not the entire story adjusting for the number of days in the quarter and excluding commissions in oreo gains and losses in the last three quarters our noninterest expense is increased  in q but more importantly its down  from q i continue to expect expense growth to be in the low singledigits for the year and before i forget since i called out computer expenses in q and they did tick up a little this quarter i feel compelled to point out that those expenses are well below the last two quarters of  but its important to know that almost all of this increase expense in the second quarter is due to the earlier than projected use of our commercial on line banking system in essence this means that we were paying for two systems during the quarter we will only be paying for one system in q and beyond thats what i wanted to cover at the top of the house just a little more on our leasing and mortgage segments as a general banking highlights they already covered equally applied to our banking segment other than i did want to mention that our new commercial on line banking system implementation was completed in the second quarter is advertised when we last spoke and its been a great success so far our new technology is easetouse its intuitive and its industryleading when we feel like this is now puts as a competitive advantage and i believe its indicative of things to come on the technology front for mb on our leasing segment we set for a long time that the way to look at this business is to look over a longer time horizon and they can be a little lumpy so heres the short version operating earnings were down  million from q and essentially flat yeartodate as compared to the prior year however the  million decrease in promotional revenue in the quarter i mentioned earlier accounts for all of that more as promotional revenue was unusually high in q and unusually low in q by the way in three out of the last four years our promotional revenue was low in q all other leasing revenue excluding promotional revenue is actually up  in q and  as compared to the first half of  absent and surprised by yearend we believe our leasing segment will show a nice improvement in revenue and profit over  and the significant investments that weve made in business development should keep the leasing segment continue to grow as we said many times we like this business total assets have grown  in the last  months and the returns on equity are substantial lastly our mortgage segments net income of  million for the quarter and  million yeartodate is on the low end of our expectations like much of the industry production volumes for us were up compared to q but down from last year gain on sale margin was down  basis points at  which is about half of the increase from the fourth to the first quarter but our business mix is headed in the right direction as we continue to see increased purchase volume as well as an increased contribution from our retail and consumer direct channels to total division production both of which are key strategic goals for our mortgage business lastly we continue to be very focused on lowering our fixed and our variable cost to perform acceptably in all rate environments before i close we expect our net interest margin to be flat to slightly increasing in q as we get the full benefit of the june rate increase but we caution that this could be offset by deposit pricing pressures and possibly unfavorable mix change especially if long growth continues at the same pace as it did in the second quarter mitch mitchell feiger okay thank you randy there are several things i like about our performance in the second quarter one is obviously a loan growth weve worked hard to improve our loan origination capability and it paid off this quarter furthermore the number of business units we have that can drive loan growth and our ability to dial up and dial down the volume of new adjustable rate residential loans we retained in our balance sheet makes me feel quite good about our loan growth prospects going forward this is a new thing for me and i think it adds a new performance dimension to our company the great funding base great fee businesses and an ability to grow loan seems like a powerful combination to me another thing i liked about our quarter is that were doing a good job sticking to the strategic plan weve been telling you about for years and it’s working our core goal is to build a higher return lower risk business this means having a balance sheet with superior profitability and lower risk and ability to consistently grow high quality loans at a healthy pace really helps it also means having a great funding pace great banks have great deposit basis by the way building a great very low cost deposit base is getting harder and i think it will continue to get harder perhaps much harder as very large banks steadily increase their share of the consumer banking market at the end of the second quarter  of our deposits were noninterest bearing in addition noninterest bearing deposits grew by around  annualized in the quarter half the acquisitions have helped built our deposit base of course but our focus on growing businesses and products that generate low cost deposits as well as fees has helped a lot furthermore those businesses are getting bigger as is their ability to contribute to our deposit fee and profit growth our strategy calls for controlled risk loans and low credit costs no issues here credit quality is great i think we all need to remember that the economic environment including steadily increasing asset prices has made seemingly good credit easy and mask poor credit practices one day those poor credit practices will come to light i should also comment that were trying to maintain conservative principles regarding provisioning for loan losses we intend to maintain a healthy allowance for loan losses considering the entire loan lifecycle for commercial related loans which are  of our loans outstanding and a greater percentage of loan commitments for commercial related loans we reserve at the time of loan origination for losses over the life of the loan the actual percentage reserve depends on loan mix but in the second quarter we reserved on average around  of the balance of each new commercial loan originated thus the large increase in our provision for loan loss at this quarter is loan growth was very strong our strategy calls for great high return fee businesses in this regard we are focusing on leasing capital markets international banking cards treasury management wealth management and mortgage and we are making good progress in all of them they dont know all  produce steady unchanging profits each quarter but id rather have a business that produces a  return on capital at one quarter and  another than one that produces  steady finally we continue to invest aggressively in human talent our investment is centered on sales and sales support staff in a number of key business lines weve also focused on technology and projects support staff and as always our leadership development program which trains college graduates in the broad art of commercial banking all right thats our report to you this quarter at this time we’re happy to take your question so austin if you can open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator sure we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from michael young with suntrust please go ahead michael young hey good morning mitchell feiger good morning randall conte good morning michael young randy i wondered if we could start maybe just on the mortgage side can you talk a little bit about  just provide a little more color on the gain on sale compression and without any efforts by you all to take market share or something else randall conte sure we can certainly hit on that well first of all i think compression is  were trying to be competitive in the marketplace for sure but we dont have any special pricing coming on in terms of trying to go after market share so you have to remember our mix of business is  although it changed positively as i pointed out from what was an   wholesale to retail business our wholesale business being the   its now much less than that but the margins in the wholesale business are much tighter than retail and as we shift our mix towards retail we expect our gain on sale to increase accordingly but right now even if i look at q to q the reduction in margin is much more substantial on the wholesale side of the business than it is in retail but to come back to your question were not pricing that take share per se were trying to be competitive in the markets we serve mitchell feiger yes just one added comment here on the market in general traditionally as volumes have declined in the marketplace say because rates rose margins in the business decline as well so volumes and margins in this business unfortunately move in the same direction right volumes down margins down or reverse volumes up margins up when rates go down and rates are up a little bit im actually pretty pleased with the way margins have reacted for us and in the industry given the somewhat higher rates well see as rates continue to move up and down what happens michael young and then maybe just a bigger picture question on the same business mitch how are you kind of measuring success and where are you trying to get do you have any guideposts there in terms of moving the business mix shift and then maybe just lastly do you still talking about sort of the  million to  million net income contribution in the business this year mitchell feiger yes i’ll take the last first yes were still eying  million to  million i think its little harder this year now than we thought it was going to be so i think its more likely if we get in that range its going to be at the lower end of the range than at the higher end of the range for this year but changes were working to make in the business were hoping will increase that range and hopefully by a meaningful amount specifically were working hard to increase the retail portion of our business and consumer direct and weve made good progress i think in the second quarter on that and were hopeful i think over the coming year that were going to continue to make good progress in that coincident with that and i think as retail goes up our purchase volumes should go up as well and i think that helps a little bit especially if rates are up having higher purchase volumes or greater percentage of purchase volumes is essential to maintaining volumes with mortgage like every one of our business segments business lines product lines you name it i mean it needs to return on appropriate return on capital and its not there yet but i think were doing the right thing i think our mortgage team is doing the right thing and i think its going to get there its going to take more time and weve made progress i think its hard to see the progress but we have made progress in that michael young okay thanks i’ll step back for now operator our next question comes from brad milsaps with sandler oneill please go ahead peter ruiz hey guys this is actually peter ruiz on for brad mitchell feiger hey peter randall conte hey peter peter ruiz maybe just looking at the nim first obviously you guys mentioned the deposit pricing pressures and i appreciate all the color that you gave around the moving parts and everything but i just kind of wanted to get your thoughts on just the general whats driving deposit pricing pressure is it increased competition among the other local banks is it bigger banks coming in or are you kind of maybe doing some onetime specials to drive up certain areas randall conte sure hey this is randy i can start certainly mark or mitch can hop in right so i sit in a regular pricing committee that we have here just to kind of see whats going on in the marketplace and especially on the retail side of the equation maybe mark you can cover commercial pressures that you are seeing but certainly to start off on the consumer side retail side were seeing a lot of local competition right now and i think someone said the other day that the best thing for papers believe it or not has been banks advertising for different specials whether they be cd specials or money market specials et cetera so were seeing a lot of local pressure and were seeing a lot of customers they come in with sheet in their hand and says that the bank down the street is offering a higher rate so were trying protect our customer base certainly and our good customer base and thats when we will tend to see what we can do also i would say that there are specials out in the marketplace that are run from timetotime i think weve tried one here or there and weve had decent results from those but thats kind of my view on whats going on if you will the number of the frequency of which our consumer customers are coming in and with  what can you do from a rate perspective it certainly picked up over the last i would say quartertoquarter and a half mark do you want to cover commercial mark hoppe sure thanks randy this is mark hoppe on the commercial side i think there  its a little bit of a combination a feed off what randy just said were seeing some indication from the commercial side about rates but its primarily our client base its really financial oriented right and theyre being  theyre right on top of it and every check is meaningful to them and they understand it and et cetera so were seeing pressure there i think in the general commercial population probably not so much but what we are seeing  so the second part of it is which i think randy and mitch both pointed out very well is we had very nice deposit growth and most of it was really in  was in commercial right when our commercial client base and new clients that we added so it was around  million in deposits we feel good about that i will say we also feel very very good about what our  the amount of loan growth that we had so  million quartertoquarter pointtopoint is a tremendous amount of growth for us were glad we did it were proud of it and we continue to move forward but that means youve got about  million some that you’ve got to get elsewhere and as we pointed out i think well in the release last night and you mention specifically borrowing that additional amount of money is going to have an impact on the nim and so were really happy with the growth and what were doing internally as we have for a long time is continue to encourage our relationship managers to  in addition to looking for loans be looking for a great deposit opportunities and i think we are doing that but this quarter i think was a pretty good example of what happens to nim when you have great loan growth but youve got to fund approximately twothirds of it with borrowings mitchell feiger yes i agree with everything mark and randy said i just had one more thing i dont think that consumer deposit pricing pressure is strong as much at all they are always rate sensitive deposit shoppers and weve reached out to some of them given our strong loan growth in the quarter but rates are only up about  basis points now in short rates and cd rates i dont believe that theyve moved far enough yet where the bulk of consumers are going to be rate shopping and moving money out of their money markets and now savings accounts in the cities if rates keep rising well get there and then well really be talking about upward rate pressure but i dont think were there yet peter ruiz got it appreciate all the color that’s great maybe just on the loan side obviously the core loan yields were up really nicely just maybe kind of expecting similar performance in the third quarter given the full june rate hike and then maybe just in terms of the accretion obviously you spoke last quarter about how it come down and i feel like kind of match the expectations does it sort of stabilize here or does it take another leg down randall conte sure i can start this is randy let’s take the second question first i think we were expecting on the accretion side it’s about  million and we are expecting that to come back  of course the numbers can move and can change but were expecting that to come down maybe  to  million or so so it continues to tick its way down as time unfold so that’s kind of the second question the first question was loan yields and what our expectation and yes i believe we are expecting similar kind of performance out of  on the loan side of the equation so as we did in the first quarter peter ruiz great appreciated guys that’s it for me operator our next question is from nathan race with piper jaffray please go ahead nathan race hey guys good morning randall conte hey nathan good morning nathan race just maybe ask the margin question in a different way and just going back to marks comments earlier the expectation that the commercial growth that youre going to be putting on in the back half of this year going to be kind of net spread accretive given kind of where you guys are funding your growth both on the wholesale end with deposit cost potentially further increasing going forward mark hoppe this is mark im not sure exactly what you mean by accretive is that i mean the nim nathan race just in terms of kind of the net spread in terms of the loans over what your funding at is that going to be accretive to where your current kind of net spread is around the  range randall conte probably net margin is that the question so our new loan at a wider spread than the current book mark hoppe i dont have that right in front of me but i can tell you that i know that were expecting that what i dont have is i dont have the spread if you will right i dont have the projected spread so i dont want to  as it take too much but were certainly expecting the pickup on the yield side i just dont have the expected spread nathan race okay that’s fine perhaps changing gears little bit on the leasing side of things are you guys seen anything from the comparison standpoint in the marketplace that impacting the overall profitability and just the revenue growth opportunities that you guys are seeing across the country and also in canada as well mark hoppe from my perspective  this is mark its very competitive that has not changed and we certainly are getting opportunities and i think were capitalizing on those opportunities as you can see the growth is really all the way across the board in our commercial sector but its challenging out there and i think there clearly is a margin impact on the business because the marketplace is so competitive weve talked about it for a long time i cant remember i called it weve had since  in the last three years that hasn’t talked about and talked about the level of competition which is great and one of our  as we’ve mentioned in the past well continue to  our diversification in the lines of business and our diversification from a geographic perspective in our loan origination we think is really really important and we think thats a particular benefit that we have with our avl business being national with our healthcare business being national with many of our  our leasing businesses being national so we think that helps us a little bit as it relates to that but i cant even  any one of those businesses as you look at them individually and theyre very competitive when they  when they are out in the marketplace i hope that answers helps or not nathan race yes that’s helpful i appreciate you guys taking the questions mitchell feiger sure operator our next question is from kevin reevey with da davidson please go ahead kevin reevey good morning guys mitchell feiger hello kevin good morning kevin reevey so just looking at your commercial online banking platform given the adoption do you anticipate kind of rethinking and kind of relooking at your branch footprint and if so what are the plans there mitchell feiger okay so the commercial online platform that we adopted is targeted at our larger  at our middle market companies and larger so i dont think it has a direct impact on our branch footprint kevin reevey okay and then on the ci side you had some pretty strong loan growth linked quarter can you talk about the specific industries or sectors where you are seeing a growth and is that more for  was that growth more for capex or working capital mark hoppe this is mark one thing i can  i alluded to it before and randy did as well as mitch in their remarks that its very broad over  the growth is very broad over our different lines so whether it was our commercial ci business which is  you can say primarily chicago metro kind of midwest you know local states here are commercial specialty which would be more geographically diverse abl would be geographically diverse cre which is primarily chicago or midwest oriented so its broad from that perspective as it relates to industries we’ve got  its also very diverse the industry i dont think there are any real industry sectors that were more pronounced than others and i would say that probably more would be working capital other than our commercial real estate most would be working capital i would say the higher percentage of working capital is fixed but mike morton i think would like to make a comment here michael morton yes just a followup to the comments in general our abl business is predominantly working capital and the real estate of course as you guys know is predominantly longterm finance capex is a smaller component but generally there is optimism growing working capital needs across the customer base kevin reevey great that’s helpful thank you operator our next question is from chris york with jmp securities please go ahead christopher york good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions so it appears you didnt reference an update to loan growth guidance but we are halfway through the year and loan growth is up i think close to  which would be at close to your midtohigh singledigit growth estimates so should we expect second half of the year loan growth to be modest randall conte look i would expect the second half of the year to be consistent with our guidance our guidance wasnt  i guess when i put it out there i wasnt thinking about a particular oneyear period  and so if the first half of  is stronger the second half would be weaker and it’s kind of a forwardlooking statement saying we expect midtohigh singledigit loan growth and i think that still the case christopher york okay fair enough and then in early may you announced addition of the healthcare banking team so the question is maybe twofold other commercial lending verticals that are attractive to you and if the right opportunity like that presented itself couldn’t make you a strategic acquirer of what people are more teams and then secondly was it the teams hire included in previous guidance metrics randall conte yes those teams were included in the previous guidance metrics i cant think of another vertical but that is immediate interest to us at the moment mark hoppe right but plus the fact that with healthcare we have a substantial healthcare business already and so this is a terrific opportunity to add some really really strong experienced healthcare bankers and so we seized the opportunity but it was like this is some new ideas something that we were pretty deep in right now and this just gives us an opportunity to ramp up our growth in that sector christopher york got it it makes sense and then maybe randy or mark what was the weightedaverage yield on new loans originated in the quarter randall conte sure weightedaverage yield on a new loans  hold on a second ill find it for you let’s say about  christopher york  okay lastly so help me reconcile kind of your comments about investing drastically in technology and then maybe the movements in the line for computer services and tech because i mean as we spoke about it didnt change very much which is great but just how to think about that in context of that line going forward with potentially future investment randall conte yes sure this is randy ill take it and certainly anyone else can jump in so lets talk about the investments right so first of all we talked about the commercial online banking theres an example  mitch and talked about the investments were making and technology generically so  but weve been investing in people first of all on the technology side where we can start to take a little bit of control over our destiny right weve been historically a buyer of systems and buyer as were in a service providers are given a systems and were looking at where we can actually step in and where we can make a  where there is a competitive advantage for us to internally do some development work and control our destiny on go forward basis so thats an example of investment one ive got another one thats extremely important of that as well and weve done some of that development already we certainly work the team worked on commercial online banking system the team has recently rolled out some system that helps make the assetbased lending business much more effective and efficient so we think we can extend that out to other parts of the organization were looking at some of our mobility if you will and capabilities there those are some examples and weve got some people that are more directed in the back office to try and figure out how we can make our operational folks more efficient through the use of technology that we develop and so we can adjust and build from there and make ourselves more efficient and be speed right the speed is very important so thats one two just even more important than that right now anyway is what were doing from an infrastructure perspective because of the word itself right infrastructure so were looking and have and well down i shouldn’t say looking were well down the path of consolidating our infrastructure in terms of our datacenters into  and as well as putting in all our new technology new infrastructure if you will so were bringing ourselves way up todate consolidating from id say almost  datacenters down to two going to a more of a colocated colo environment which will make us more efficient its much less expensive in terms of facilities the power is much more consistent than the business continuity the security et cetera so those are some things were doing from an infrastructure perspective what that will mean is again speed the market the ability to spin up servers the ability to softwareasaservice infrastructureasaservice all of that kind of stuff we see in our very very near future which i think will help everybody in the bank and going to things like that in office  and productivity tools for the individual employees should start to pick up dramatically from what weve had in the past so well be able to do some things in the office to other offices that will help with our productivity from a number of perspectives so that’s the  unless mitch you wanted to offer and add anything did that answer that question before i get into the specifics of the line itself christopher york yes i mean that color is tremendously helpful in providing two of those examples and kind of going through that infrastructure internally so yes no it was mark hoppe okay so then lets take the specific line of expense if you will so the thing that’s interesting about the whole solution on the infrastructure side is it literally is the best we can imagine right if you think about it were making all those investment but it was actually going to make us more effective from an expense perspective per se not only the productivity not only the ability to speed the market but its going to be cheaper for us less expensive on a go forward basis and on that front we did a  were doing a lot of contract looking at our contracts so we had a major contract that came up at the end of the year that we were able to negotiate several others that weve been negotiating and thats driving our expense in that roll if you will down so i was trying to explain with my little comments that albeit the expense went up roughly  or  i think it was  or  from the first quarter to second quarter and the totality  almost all of that expense base is is a result of the fact that something good right we rolled out our commercial and implemented our commercial online banking system a whole quarter in essence ahead of it and then some a little bit more than a quarter ahead of when we had hoped to do and expected to roll it out and as a result of that weve negotiated ourselves into a position where we had to keep that second system for a period of time so we paid for two systems throughout the  in the second quarter and for part of the first as well so thats what i was trying to get at with my comments around the expense line itself did that help christopher york it did thank you very much for that color thats helpful in thinking about it and thats it for me so thanks for taking the questions mark hoppe sure operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead kelly motta hi this is kelly motta on for chris mcgratty mark hoppe hi kelly motta so looking at your loantodeposit ratio is obviously up quite a bit from last year without the growth you’ve been seeing i was wondering if theres room to move higher than this and how we should be thinking about funding the loan growth that you continue to expect randall conte yes sure this is randy ill take a piece of that and then obviously others can jump in so weve done some work on that just to kind of if you will click through that number because it was  we’ve seen the increase along with all of you so whats interesting about that is some portion  some large portion of our loans that are in there on the resi loans can actually be funded and are funded through advances if you will right so when we start to look we took our loantodeposit ratio and kind of bifurcated it into resi versus the rest of the portfolio and that gets that ratio down right into the   range when you exclude resi mortgages from the calculation so we feel like  to answer your first question we have some more room there right certainly from a loan deposit ratio i don’t  mitch if you want to comment feel free so thats kind of my view on the loan deposit ratio mitchell feiger i think theres a little bit of room so residential mortgage loans are up about  million from a yearago and so thats been a primary mover of the increase in our loantodeposit ratio but as randy pointed out they are more easily financeable than other kinds of loans so it helps a little bit that said our loan deposit ratio is getting up there and i dont see it moving debt if it moves higher it cant  there isn’t enough room to move it that much higher so were looking hard at it and we have an ability to drive more deposits and we will if we need to if we get to a position where we just are uncomfortable with a broader measures of liquidity loan deposit ratio is the only one we look at surely if we get uncomfortable with where were at well just drive more deposits as long as the marginal business provides the right returns on capital kelly motta okay thanks for that i know in your prepared remarks you focused more on utilizing your internal business channels for deposit generation as you said just now you have more levers to pull should you need that but could you talk about your appetite for ma particularly on the deposit side and if you’re looking at that as a way to bolster your strong deposit base randall conte so your question is would we be interested in acquiring a deposit rich company that otherwise is healthy kelly motta yes randall conte yes and weve made i dont know a couple of dozen acquisitions since ive been at this company that look just like that but that said and as ive commented a number of times in prior calls the number of institutions that meet that profile meaning high quality and deposit rich is very limited now so the opportunity for the limited the chances that we could execute on one of those i think is lower maybe quite a bit lower than it was in previous years kelly motta okay thanks for that and then the last question i have with your nim guidance i know you said that you expect deposit cost to continue to go up with that but i was wondering what sort of deposit beta youre factoring in when thinking about your foreign nim trajectory randall conte yes so this is randy and weve kind of  it’s not as easy as it sounds right because weve kind of taking different betas on the different categories of deposits as we look forward so our beta is what  i believe and i think its slightly higher than that on a go forward which is what were using from the modeling perspective mitchell feiger yes but its really complicated right some deposits will have very high betas and others will have a beta thats zero so the mix matters are lot and its a really hard question to answer with a single unfortunately with the single number and by the way our forecasts are  well theyre probably as good as any none of our deposit beta forecasts are going to be very accurate i think because you’re dealing with consumer behavior and none of us  nobody i know is really good at predicting consumer behavior in this kind of situation especially considering really haven’t been here before so indiscernible ive heard this before either it’s caution on people thinking about nim expansion for our company and for the industry im not saying were unusual relative to the industry i think everybody has very high hopes for nim expansion and i wonder about that especially as rates go up and we hit that that consumer threshold that really makes them act on their deposits and nobody knows where that is kelly motta thank you so much mitchell feiger sure operator our next question is a followup from michael young with suntrust please go ahead michael young hey thanks for the followup just wanted to go back to the lease promotion income randy could you give us the amount maybe in the first quarter versus the second quarter so we can just have a sense of that seasonality going forward randall conte sure so a quarter that’s  million decrease difference and so i think that the end points are like   on q and  million is my memory on q about right my memory is accurate we just confirmed that michael young that’s good to hear and then mitch or mark maybe sort of bigger picture on just acb bankers returning to lending this quarter for a full quarter would you kind of maybe qualitatively characterize that as some of the lift this quarter or was it still just broadbased outside of that mark hoppe i wouldnt characterize it as a lift this quarter but remember we hadnt randy alluded to it a little bit different context but for most of the quarter we were working on converting clients in waves to our new online banking system and as we talked about it that that was a more major conversion than probably  certainly than any acquisition that has occurred because when you convert a new company via acquisition youre just converting that company right that the customers from that banker financial institution in this one we converted every business client in our company so we impacted every one of our commercial clients and so you can only imagine the effort that not only the it people had in our treasury management people had in our ops people had but every one of the relationship managers and every one of the support staff spent incredible amounts of time for much of the second quarter on that and as a result quite frankly our people including the acb folks really not in the market as much as we would like indeed and but they  i feel anyway that they are beginning to hit their stride now and im saying that without having everybodys backlog it right in front of me right now but im saying that we have  as i think weve mentioned all of you before we have loan committee that meets twice a week and of course if there are things that cant wait we have other ways to make sure those get done with the right amount of oversight but in committee again we meet frequently were seeing more opportunities come up and im comfortable and with the place that our acb a legacy acb obviously now mb bankers are  i think theyre feeling more comfortable and were starting to see things move forward mitch mitchell feiger yes just to be clear about it i agree with mark said about the acb bankers so their contribution in the second quarter was fairly neutral so i wouldn’t call them contributors to loan growth which is pretty exciting to be  because theres plus of them and they are bringing in new relationships and they’re getting traction and i think that only grows from here theyre really doing a good job and i think what mark was trying to allude to and he’s talking about the online banking system is the american chartered people were particularly challenged in that their clients had just gone through a conversion only a few months before that so this was the second time around so they were particularly attentive appropriately so their clients in this new commercial online platform that move when it incredibly well so worked out great but i think consumable upside yet coming from that team michael young great color i appreciate that and one last one randy real quick just on the nim guide was that core or reported flat quarteroverquarter randall conte that is reported michael young reported okay so some benefit to the core margin just offsetting the decline in purchase accounting accretion randall conte yes michael young okay thank you randall conte sure operator our next question is from brian martin with fig partners please go head brian martin hey guys mitchell feiger hi brian randall conte hi brian brian martin hey maybe just one different way of thinking about mark or mitch on the loan growth you know i guess any sense it didnt sound like theres any sense theres any cannibalization of future growth from what you saw this quarter so i guess is that thats seen unfair or maybe just kind of seen where the pipelines are at today how is the pipeline today versus where it was last quarter randall conte i just want to make sure we got the question right your question is essentially did we pull loan growth forward so growth that we otherwise perhaps would have seen in the third or perhaps fourth quarter question as to some of that show up in the second quarter okay michael morton yes this is mike generally its been my experience that loans push as opposed to pull forward in financing brian martin okay and i guess maybe just the pipeline today where does it stand relative to where it was last quarter michael morton i think we’ve had a strong pipeline really across our different lines i want to say for probably about three or four quarters in a row and i think for the time of year and where we are in the cycle i think this is very similar to where we have been a lot of things went our way in the last quarter for the large amount of growth if you recall the quarter before that was not as strong so we feel very good in all of our lines as it relates to where we are its moved a little bit the pipe from line to line but in total it feels about the same as we were to coming into the second quarter brian martin okay perfect and just other  couple other housekeeping the tax rate as you kind of think about the second half of the year in  how should we be thinking about that mitchell feiger hey brian same way weve been saying for forever so the only thing i probably add to that is just obviously theres a change in the illinois side of the equation and we have done some thinking around that and we think that’s about a  basis points in to the tax rate john you want to add anything john francoeur yes the only other thing is just the tax effects on the stock options that can make it fluctuate a little bit too so randy is right on but i think there can be some volatility going forward brian martin okay and maybe randy just on the mortgage mix you kind of talked about as you kind of change the mix over time maybe seeing some opportunity there to build i guess to add to how much mortgage contributes i mean can you just give kind of some color where the mix is today and i guess where it may be heading and wed like to see it be heading over time randall conte yes sure i was confused so let me speak very clearly on this so first of all the mix from a funding purpose was  purchase which is  i dont remember when it was that going back to  when we started this business so  purchase  finance now funded by channel is  thirdparty  retail again maybe theres a point estimate out there where we had more in retail if there is i dont remember that mitch i dont know if mark… mitchell feiger that’s okay randall conte so what  mix wise geez i wish i had philip on the phone or brian but im going to  if we could balance that off too and get that number from s into the mid to upper s that would be a good start from my perspective and the idea is that just so were clear at the moment right the idea would be to grow the retail side of the equation the margins are very  are much higher and its very hard to look at our gain and sale and compare it to a shop thats essentially all retail and youre just going to stare at that and say what the hecks going on and thats whats going on brian martin okay thats helpful and maybe just back to the loan portfolio one question kind of your retail exposure can you guys kind of quantify where that today and just maybe just how that portfolio is tracking performance wise i guess i assume its still very healthy at this point but any color on the size and how its tracking randall conte and by retail  youre talking about shopping centers brian martin correct randall conte yes okay michael morton brian this is mike let me start with just a little color on todays reported information and extrapolate a little bit so if you look at our charge off numbers and you look at our day is still accruing and you see how small those balances are theres virtually no real estate in there and i can tell you theres no retail related real estate stepping up a little bit if you look at the nonperforming loans that we show the whole cre book reported there is  million of which there is no retail on a bigger picture basis this is less than  of the portfolio and we then of taking a little bit of a dive into that and weve looked at i guess what you would call national names and over  of that portfolio contains none of the usual suspects with respect to national names  of the portfolio has got some of the national tenant names but that is represented by your typical fast food names at about  of the portfolio drugstores at  and your beverage retailers at  and then we get into some very small numbers medium singledigit granularity in some of the other type of retail functions and as mitch alluded to when you think about a strip center its your typical service type businesses and when it comes to the big box we just dont have a lot mitchell feiger just to add certainly scrutiny is elevated we talk about it a lot its obviously in the media but at this point were not overly alarmed about what maybe in there and one last comment and i think our single largest retail exposure is about  million brian martin okay perfect that color is very helpful just and maybe the last thing for me and i’ll hop out was the  randy you talked about the expense growth this year i guess i think the  number you gave i dont recall it i guess if that  i guess assume thats just the core reported number and maybe the bigger picture question is as you look to  i mean you guys have done a good job on the expense side as far as managing that i mean is there anything that would take the growth rate up and the expense is kind of in  i guess if you think absent the mortgage which has a fluctuation just kind of the banking and leasing how do you think about the growth in expenses going forward randall conte yes so i have no reason at this moment right to think its any other  any different than what we have right now having said that well start our whole set of processes as it relates to really refining our view on  and in the third quarter and fourth quarter  later in the third quarter and fourth quarter so well see what kind of investments we want to make et cetera but that will be offset from some of the efficiencies that i spoke to and alluded to earlier in the conversation so i would stay with the same number as i sit here right now brian martin okay i appreciate thanks for taking the questions operator our next question comes from brian zabora with hovde group please go ahead brian zabora thanks good morning mitchell feiger hey brian randall conte hey brian brian zabora just the question of the provision expansion it sounded like that maybe the loan growth going forward or can be more commercially focused and we dial back right here a bit should we think about the provision expense maybe being a bit higher than what we saw maybe the first and second quarter and maybe you guys in the second quarter given the strong growth with some work in between is that fair randall conte well this is randy ill start thats a hard one right for but yes assuming the exact same thing right this at the same scenario with less loan growth by the expected come back some mitchell feiger less loan growth and this and that recoveries thats right so i mean the pieces are you know we had absolutely and that recovery  whatever its zero right and given the same fact pattern with less loan growth id expect that provisioning to come down from where it is but well see randall conte actually it would be a good thing i suppose if the provision actually went up right i mean if we have net recoveries again in the provision goes up that means we had more loan growth mitchell feiger that’s right brian zabora i was just maybe referring to see that the shifting more towards commercial so if i really got maybe past quarters because as indicative looking at the provision expense versus indiscernible growth that given it sounds like more commercial it might be at a higher rate than weve seen in the past commensurate with growth is that kind of your fair way to look at it randall conte i would probably yes i mean it agreed that growth rotates from resi mortgage for example to commercial that the provisioning larger which makes sense right in the risk of loss in a commercial loan is certainly greater than the risk of loss on an appropriately originate residential mortgage loan these days brian zabora great thanks for taking the questions randall conte absolutely operator the next question comes from jason oetting with jpmorgan please go ahead jason oetting hey good morning everybody mitchell feiger hey jason jason oetting hi just one question for me for interactive vehicle if i recall correctly yours is not the typical auto portfolio i know you concentrate more on rv and motorcycle so i’m just curious if you can provide an update on the risk profile there in terms of where you see on delinquency rates average ficos and any other kind of updates you can provide michael morton yes this is mike and weve discussed in general in the past this is a seasonal business with major segments being motorcycles power sports and really over the last two and a half years expansion into the asset classes of boats and rv the average fico score basically  of that portfolio is an average of over  and  of the portfolio has got an average fico greater than  so the portfolio was holding up very very well actual demand is up per se weve written more contracts quarteroverquarter in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter but were very pleased with the portfolio no surprises durations are getting a little bit longer as we get more weighted in rvs and boats obviously those loans have a longer term to them but in general no surprises and very pleased with the growth jason oetting okay thanks for the color operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mitchell

materially from those anticipated or projected for a list of some of these factors please see mb financials forwardlooking statements disclosure in their  first quarter earnings release also as a reminder today’s conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to mr mitchell feiger president and chief executive officer please go ahead mitchell feiger okay thanks ryan good morning everyone thank you for joining us today we are reporting to you a little later than usual this at because we wanted to have time to rework our earnings release we are committed to provide with the best most useful most timely most reliable information we can i think randy and john and the rest of our financial reporting team is excellent improvements in our earnings release as such we like the expanded mortgage disclosure i hope you find it useful please let us know how you feel about our new format and what are the changes you’d like us to do i’ll begin our report to you this morning with a few general comments randy will follow with a more detailed review of our financial results and provide you with added insight into our performance then we’d be happy to take your questions so our first quarter i think is solid in almost all regards net income of  million compared to  million last quarter and  million in the first quarter last year diluted earnings per share were  this quarter compared to  last quarter and  in the year ago quarter operating earnings per share increased around  annualized over the prior quarter and around  over the same quarter a year ago please see our earnings release for the definition of operating earnings but generally it excludes what we consider to be noncore items importantly our return on average tangible common equity increased to over  this quarter and our return on average assets increased to  also most capital ratios increased meaningfully we remained committed to building a high return lower risk company that also happens to have good growth and i like our progress i also like the way our balance sheet and income statement responded to rising interest rates our net interest margin expanded  basis points while strong expense control helped to spend our mortgage earnings the mortgage segment earned  more than last quarter and  more than the same quarter a year ago even though higher interest rate caused the volume of mortgages originated for sale has declined  from the last quarter and  from the same quarter a year ago we still expect mortgage to earn between  million and  million this year assuming net interest rates don’t go crazy and rise dramatically but staying in that range will of course be harder if interest rates rise and mortgage origination volumes fall staying on the seam of rising interest rates while we worked very hard to build a fantastic stable low cost deposit base and we believe we have an assetsensitive balance sheet that will benefit from higher interest rates i am not convinced that industry margins will respond to rising rates as people expect for example if margin widens as rates rise will banks maintain their loan and deposit pricing disciplines or will they compete away some or all to gain margins how will bank depositors react to rising rates people keep the deposit data but that’s a linear sense depositors don’t behave linear only they may very well could tight as rates rise and so we can’t stand anymore then they all move at once aggressively seeking higher returns on their money which means margins would increase at first and perhaps increase again as rates rise and so depositors flock up higher retain products driving margins out from their highs or – if anyone gets my point here is we believe that having a diversified right balanced business model like mb has will be beneficial when if rates rise having multiple loan sources especially within commercial categories having the best granular client needed deposits having key businesses that can grow and provide high returns regardless of interest rates are all important one other comment about rising interest rates some people have asked that how our leasing business and lease loans will respond to changing interest rates keep in mind that things are generally short duration fixed rate amortizing assets the best thing for our leasing and leased loan businesses is a strong economy in which companies hedge capital and technology assets in the past high on interest rates have helped us well as companies lease more equipment rather than use their own cash or borrowings to fund equipment purchases getting back to the quarter and speaking of leasing our leasing segment had a solid quarter and is well positioned to continue its growth and success which is a well performing high return on capital business i thought expense control was good across our company our challenge is and will be balancing expense control against making the investments we need to make and should make in our business especially in technology we are committed to building a more nimble operating platform that can respond quickly and in a highly customized way the client needs a market opportunity this is especially important in some of our highest growth and highest roe businesses including cards payments treasury management leasing and more it’s also important that mobile and internet banking it’s also important in helping us lower our operating cost in attracting and retaining the best talent possible especially young talent we are making those investments and randy will tell you about a successful one in a couple of minutes one other thing you should know regarding expenses is that we are closing five branches next month these closures are mostly due to branch overlap caused by our recent american chartered bank acquisition moving on credit quality was ridiculously during the quarter i think things can’t get any better but it did i’ll be right at some point next one maybe coming soon simply because nonperforming loans we can’t go down much more at the end of the first quarter we had only  million of nonperforming commercialrelated loans and that’s on a  billion portfolio even consumerrelated nonperforming loans are down but they move in a much narrower range you can see all the data in our earnings release speaking of credits and loans while commercialrelated loan growth was negligible in the first quarter our pipeline remains strong and we expect commercial loan growth to return that combined with continued residential mortgage in consumer loan growth should push overall loan growth to our prior guidance of mid to highsingledigits all right enough for me i’ll turn it over to randy randall conte okay thanks mitch and good morning everyone so i too hope that you speak you sync with our new earnings release format and added disclosure and we do welcome your feedback and we are going to reach out to you sometime in the near future to get that and with that i’d like to go into the highlights for the quarter which includes operating earnings of  million and operating and operating earnings per common share was  net interest margin expansion was  basis points to  excluding accretion this was led by an increase in loan yields continued strong credit quality metrics as mitch pointed out on nearly all fronts highlighted by reduced nonperforming loans and assets and net recoveries for the quarter lower than forecasted core noninterest expense with reductions in mortgage as well as consumer services expense leading the way overall loan growth of  or  annualized with residential real estate and indirect accounted for most of the growth total periodend deposits were down  million due mainly to a reduction in mortgage escrow balances and the sale of our philadelphia branch in march but also due in part to normal seasonal fluctuations total low cost deposits make up  of our deposit base and our cost of deposits increased  basis point in year end and lastly strong returns on average assets at  while returns on average tangible common equity lowered  in overall i agree what mitch has indicated and i think it’s a solid quarter consistent with our strategy of building a high performing diversified bank other highlights included in our banking segment commercial loan growth was essentially flat in a seasonally low first quarter but pipelines are strong net interest income was down  million as compared to q due primarily to two less days in the quarter partially offset by an increase in loan yields also in the commercial – sorry also in the banking segment the reduction in total assets at period end due to the internal transfer of previously acquired residential real estate loans to our mortgage segment by the way now nearly all of our residential real estate loans are managed by our mortgage experts noninterest income was up slightly to  million in the quarter with small increases in nearly every category except capital markets and international which declined due to lower customer interest rate swap fees in the quarter and reduced ma fees and our key three initiatives continue to be a critical part of our overall strategy american chartered loans were down a little in the quarter but we feel that’s a tide that’s turning now as our bankers are back in the marketplace and we are seeing growing pipelines and lastly in our banking segment we have successfully converted twothirds of our commercial customers to our new commercial online banking system and have encountered no issues to speak of at all at this time our last customer conversion weight is scheduled in may our new technology is easy to use it’s intuitive and its industryleading we feel like this now puts us at a competitive advantage and it’s clearly a huge step forward for our customers our bankers and operations moving on our leasing segment had a strong quarter with  million in net income adjusting for the reversal of provision in q our net income grew by  in the first quarter and it’s trending up nicely over the past five quarters noninterest income was up nearly  million in the quarter led by higher residual gains and promotional income expenses were up as well but this is due mainly to increased commissions as a result of lower indirect capitalized costs our mortgage segment net income of nearly  million is in line with our expectations and guidance additional disclosures are included in this earnings release as mitch pointed with breakdowns of mortgage origination and mortgage servicing revenue as well as additional disclosure on our gain on sale and mortgage servicing assets mortgage origination revenue was down  million from last quarter with gain on sale margins declining  basis points from q to  and a reduction in originated for sale mortgage volume of approximately  million mortgage servicing revenue increased by  million in the quarter mostly due to lower amortization and prepayments noninterest expense decreased nearly  million in our mortgage segment much of this was due to changes in volume but there has been substantial effort to impact our fixed cost in our mortgage segment and it’s starting to show its salary and benefit expenses as well as computer services and telecommunication expenses have all increased and for the last time as it’s getting harder to breakout as american chartered is fully integrated into our system and processes our view on the transaction that our expense reductions are in line with our estimates and as we indicated earlier we have five branch consolidations thus far – those are all on target and last but not least all estimates are in line with our projections at the time we announced the transaction and before i close we expect our net interest margin to be up slightly or slightly increasing i should say in this rate environment mitch mitchell feiger okay thanks randy ryan we will open up for questions now thanks questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from jason with jpmorgan please go ahead jason oetting hey good morning everybody mitchell feiger good morning jason jason oetting when we think about the deposit decrease tied to – there is a few items lower than mortgage escrow the sale of the philadelphia branch and just normal seasonality can you quantify how much each of those – i remember it was more in mortgage and the philly branch randall conte sure hey this is randy it’s around  million  million and i would call it  million on the mortgage side up  million on the branch sale and the less due to normal seasonal fluctuations jason oetting okay great thanks and then i know it’s too – switching to margins i guess the savings deposit breaking down  basis point quarteroverquarter just curious if there is anything noteworthy there or any detail on what drove that down randall conte hey this is randy again i just want to make sure i understood the question since it was a little bit of an interruption there could you just repeat it for me jason oetting yes savings deposit rates down  basis point just curious what drove that randall conte nine basis points no there is nothing unusual there jason oetting okay and then just to clarify to with the five branch closures coming up that was already contemplated in the cost savings right randall conte that’s correct jason oetting great thank you randall conte sure operator our next question comes from brad milsaps with sandler oneill please go ahead brad milsaps hey good morning guys mitchell feiger good morning brad brad milsaps i think randy the level of accretion income has been pretty consistent the last few quarters since your – what is your crystal ball say there in terms of kind of timing and what about recognition say for the balance of the year and into  randall conte sure i would say it’s fairly consistent to maybe a little down i think it’s down  to  from last quarter if my memory serves me and – but in terms of any changes in guidance or thought process around it is staying pretty true to what we’ve talked about before brad milsaps okay and then was there any provisioning this quarter related to the acquired loans or is all that pretty much to the legacy book john francoeur this is john we continue to provide through the acquired loans on a quarterly basis so they start renewing if we do provide for those so that’s going to be – we’d be continuing that consistently since the – pay our transaction and we will continue to do that with the bdos and some of the core payments to be able to rather continue building up brad milsaps okay so that number will be in the q at first john francoeur i am not sure brad milsaps okay john francoeur we use to disclose that and that i believe the last couple quarters we haven’t we’ll take a look at it and see brad milsaps that’s fine and then just kind of more strategically mitch you guys retain more one to four family residential this quarter i know the commercial was more than you expected but it sounds like the pipeline is good can you talk about strategic process around retaining more of the one to four family and kind of how you might or may or may not do that in the future mitchell feiger i’ll keep it off and anybody who are here can jump in and correct me so my thinking on working mortgaging assets once we are keeping our high quality adjustable rate loans and the returns on capital we think are pretty good for those assets and i think we are going to continue to put them on our balance sheet until we can’t frankly so larger strategic thought here been set but it looks like we can grow loans as i mentioned in the mid to single – mid to highsingledigits okay in the first quarter we grew loans about  annualized and that with adversely no commercial loan growth commercial loan growth returns right that number is going to probably go up the challenge for us it’s not just us for anybody in our situation is growing high quality low cost deposits at that same rate and that’s a really really hard thing to do and so i think that as loans continue to grow they grow and we can’t grow high quality low cost deposits at the same pace we are going to be faced with the decision about which loans to keep on our balance sheet and i think that that’s a kind of a global thought and we’ve faced this before and if we face it again we’ll go through the loan book and we’ll look for the loans that have the lowest return returns on capital riskadjusted returns on capital we’ll probably go after those and try and move them elsewhere i am not sure where resi mortgage is ranking this year we haven’t gone through the exercise in depth so i don’t have the exact answer for you i want to say one more thing about that one thing good thing about the resi mortgage hold is that of course it’s easy to turn off those are entirely saleable and our mortgage team would be happy to sell them and then actually the short run of it’s right more mortgage income i think that’s correct now that’s kind of how we are thinking about it at the moment i would say one more thing about deposits and i am worried about it i think loan growth is going to remain healthy i think they will probably remain healthy in the industry rising rates would put some i just now – and just now beginning to put pressure on deposit pricing and liquidity and if rates continue to rise i’ll worry about i worry about the liquidity aspects and the industry’s ability to raise low cost deposits so we are – bear in top of mind for us we are doing what we can to improve our already great low cost deposit gathering businesses and i very much like our position i like our position more than anybody else in that regard but that’s what’s to be done there i don’t know anybody want to add randall conte that should covering… mitchell feiger sorry long winded answer to a short question brad milsaps no that’s great mitch we appreciate thanks for all the new disclosure operator and our next question comes from nathan race with piper jaffray please go ahead nathan race hey guys good morning mitchell feiger good morning nathan nathan race want to just start on the loan yield increase this quarter randy if you kind of help us understand how much of that was a function of the production that you guys put on balance sheet this quarter versus the benefit that we had to see a december hike randall conte so you are talking mortgage then in terms of the production nathan race no the core loan yield was up nine basis points linked quarters so you kind of help us understand how much of that was a function of the production that you guys put on the balance sheet versus the benefits of the rate hike in december randall conte no really no i don’t know i don’t know that specifically so i’d be speculating that – on that question nathan nathan race i guess just ask it in a different way can we can expect a similar increase in the second quarter given that rate hike that we had in march randall conte well let’s talk about – yes i would think that we should see if i try to say but i stumble my words slightly increasing our noninterest margin in this interest rate environment right so that’s one and then let’s talk about what we do know right most of those loans just we get close on – the number of loans that are in the money inflows has reduced fairly dramatically where it sounded about  million less than the entire portfolio so  just we would say that any kind of rate hike is going to – to me anyway start to have more and more of an impact right and fall right to the bottomline and that’s an example the other thing i would quote is that a substantial portion of the loans are variable rate in nature nearly i think  billion of the loan portfolios is in variable rate either in libor based loans prime based loans et cetera and of that substantial portion is libor so again as rates move we expect to see similar increases that number have stayed pretty consistent over the last few quarters and those are couple fund facts i think could help support the points nathan race now that’s very helpful i appreciate that color and then the increase in wholesale funding cost this quarter was that just a function of the rate hike in december was there any other items that impacted that higher level of funding cost this quarter randall conte no nothing that’s true you got it you’ve been able to the one thing i would do nathan is i am going to go back and i’ll let mr john or mark or someone can resist me on this one but when i do look kind of at a rate volume analysis and we do that analysis on our assets and then particular in loans we saw a couple million dollars on the rate side if you put the rate variances so here it was loans so it’s about a  million rate pick up increase in interest income let me be clear associated with the rate change and if that’s the question we are asking that i have very specifically and so hopefully that’s a little bit more color for you nathan race just to be perfect but you guys we can’t talk about if that was call it the ambition of new loans at higher rates those would be increase in base rates randall conte that’s right i don’t have disclosed that’s exactly accurate we do not have to split on that  million approximately between new loans generated and new loans originated versus the rate increase so but i can give a flavor for the amount of the – we can give flavor to the amount anyway nathan race that’s perfect thanks and i appreciate the disclosures you released randall conte you are welcome operator our next question comes from michael young with suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead michael young hey good morning everyone mitchell feiger good morning michael young i want to start with randy your comments on the twothirds of the commercial customers have already moved over to the new online banking system and another i guess onethird coming in q but maybe just a big picture question how you expect that to actually impact the balance sheet or income statement going forward in terms of either stickier deposits going forward or higher fees lower expenses et cetera randall conte well let me say i’ll take a piece of that and then i am going to refer over to mr hoppe here but he’ll he give you his view on this as well but first of all i would say that our commercial online banking system has been submarket substandard and i think as it’s just an old version that hasn’t there was time to the change we needed to bring it current and then some and that’s what we did and we then converted the entire system over and it’s a whole fresh look and it’s very intuitive as i pointed out what this can do to the balance sheet is that i think it’s going to enable our bankers to get out and get into the marketplace and feel comfortable that they’ve got a system that has the capable – their customers are going to have the capabilities at their finger tips to transact business the way they would like in an easy way and then efficiently go about doing their business now i would tell you that i think i would think the american chartered bankers in particular the ex american chartered bankers were used to a different system that was a greater step or two above what we had at – as legacy mb prior and that’s what we – and we converted away from that old system to a system that i think is and we think is better than what american chartered bankers were used to so what that could do is calm the nerves that actually have the online banking capabilities for our customers and let those bankers get back into the marketplace and go after do business and that will impact the balance sheet from loan growth and other aspects but i’ll stop there and let mark jump in see what he actually has about mark hoppe not really a lot but no because randy hit most of the major points just a little bit different angle on it our bankers have been so excited to have this new product and we’ve been researching this for years approximately three or four years this is such a critical critical product and we want to make sure we had capabilities which were strong for our existing clients and then once we anticipate adding and so very solid that i’ve seen in my years in banking a relationship manager excited about a new product as this one and it’s not only a new product but new system and a new processes and provides a lot of advantages for our clients and we’ll make things easier for them as it relates to dealing with us on a daily basis with our online banking so when you see clients or when you see – excited about something i think it’s meaningful i wouldn’t put a dollar and cents to it what is this going to add but it’s certainly going to add to our efficiency and it’s also going to add to our clients’ efficiencies whenever you do something like that it’s beneficial michael young okay thanks and mitch maybe your comments on asset quality and how can’t get any better understand on this more of a big picture comment but what are the specific areas that you are maybe most watchful of near term mitchell feiger well i only have one concern that’s credit and that is the recent credit is good not just here but i think across the industry because there are companies or people lenders out there is that make loans that we won’t and so when we have a problem asset it finds another home probably a good home so it finds another home very quickly and so i think my sense is that here and across the company there continues to be challenges it’s not that there is a downward migration in the quality there is downward migration but the exit doors wide open and i think i said this in prior calls what worries me is if that exit door closes what happens but other than that there is nothing to look at that i’d – do you have any concerns about the portfolio randall conte no that’s so to your comment that we’ve been successful using the competitive landscape to exit some of the more marginal credits i think on a more global portfolio basis we continue to look at loans that have multiple concessions than other things and it seems like some of the traditional things that used to be concessionary had now morphed into reasonable customary and standard and so when the landscape keeps lowering the bar more and more concessions those loans are certainly on our radar screen especially if they ask for additional concessions and then we revert back using the competitive landscape to exit some of those michael young okay great thanks operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead chris mcgratty hey good morning gentlemen randall conte good morning chris chris mcgratty i mean mitch i want to go back to the comments if we could on the balance sheet and the deposit concerns i am interested in kind of big picture how you think this plays out not only for you but for the industry i guess maybe starting with you does this kind of conservatism on deposits necessitate a further indexing of the earning assets from securities i kind of reduced the securities portfolio to fund the growth and then secondarily i guess i am interested in any comments on how you think this plays out from an ma perspective given the desire to grow deposits whether your role has changed or will change and what do you think competitors will change with you thanks mitchell feiger i am going to take the second part first and then i’ll hand it off to randy to answer the question about balance sheet and investments and things like that so right as funding gets tighter deposit becomes here  and i would think that deposit rich franchises would become more in demand if you look at the companies at mb has acquired over the years numbers wise most have been deposit rich franchises right that we view as to fund commercial loan growth on the last two american chartered and our merger with taylor are the different nature but if you look at the six banks acquisitions we did in  and  those are obviously are  deposit focused because by definition the loans are not low so much and if you go back prior to that in  go back a while but those were banks – with deposit rich companies low loan to deposit ratio so i think that maybe some people will also affected at that time – that kind of thinking in acquisitions that said if you look particularly around the chicago marketplace there aren’t a lot of banks they have low loan to deposit ratios and great deposit base it’s a limited number for sure so i am not – i guess what i am saying is they increase the desire of people who buy deposit rich franchises and lenders will be available randy do you want to hit the balance sheet question randall conte sure sure so speaking specifically to the investments question i mean throughout – i am going to go back to  and throughout  we weren’t really selling an investments and nor have we actively pursued the sale of investments to fund the balance sheet as indicated up to this point through  either what we have seen is that portfolio  we didn’t really see any good investments to make and given where interest rates were and what our standards are and so we kind of stick – stuck to our discipline in  and trying to generate the returns that we are comfortable with and used to some of the investment portfolios so we provide that portfolio repay as over the course of the – that  months if you will and only this time only in this quarter for the first time in a while have started to see our treasurer make some small purchases where we’ve seen investments that are meeting the standards and those of the products used to over the course of the last several years so now to the bigger picture obviously they will be more strategic question of would we do that if necessary i think it goes right after mitch’s point and when we have to wait the exit side or the different categories of that on our page and see those returns are and how they are returning on capital and do that across the board and i wouldn’t exclude or i would include our investment portfolio in that evaluation so that would be my reaction to it at this point in time we have not yet to do that but as mitch pointed out i think it could be time to take a look at that in the near future chris mcgratty that’s great if i could just sneak in a couple followups mitch does this – is your desire to be primarily chicagobased – does this change at all with you kind of broaden the footprint off if you saw something mitchell feiger i think your – well let’s pack up i was chicago based yes and our coromandel market commercial banking business is  in chicago focusing chicago for sure but if you look at the loans on our balance sheet now some – a little bit more than half of our loans are outside illinois at this point and if you think about it if you got the big buckets outside that are national right our assetbased loans around  million i don’t know really exact numbers but on the order of  million but saw a very small percentage those are in illinois our residential mortgage loans that are about  billion now probably less than half are in illinois i don’t know the exact number of these loans which are approaching  billion our national and so a low percentage of that is in illinois and then we got our healthcare business that’s been expanding outside the illinois and more and the reason for that is that economic growth frankly and certainly an ability to come to market with great products that caused us to go outside the states so that’s straight forward secondly regarding deposits and i think that’s where you are going i think it’s really hard to acquire a franchise in another market where we would be unknown and being successful at it i would roll it out entirely i think we are very open minded company about lots of things and it’s possible but i think that’s got a much higher hurdle across to do it we have to view the – an extraordinary opportunity and one that we felt need to be successful in the market even without any other brand recognition and by the way an ability to help ourselves with people and staff in markets who know the markets let me sort of stepping around and there have been a lot of companies that have come to the chicago marketplace from outside states and almost entirely they have been unsuccessful over the years and i think the reason is this is a highly competitive market i think going back many years some people can’t really understand the market and they were in a situation where they were unable to help themselves because their teams and the knowledge base was elsewhere and we just don’t want to put ourselves in that position so it’s not entirely impossible but i think unlikely and hard to do chris mcgratty okay that’s awesome color just one quick one and i spend this to talk about all the investments you are making and the synergies and the deals is there a specific rate of growth that you guys might be targeting or is it a function of just managing the expense growth rate to ensure positive operating leverage thanks randall conte sure so hey this is randy from an expense growth perspective i mean that it stayed consistent with what we commented on last quarter we’ve got and what that was frankly was low singledigit type numbers of an increase right so and i think with the success we had in the first quarter we are continuing to focus on kind of the balance that mitch pointed out right those opportunities to save and reduce our core expenses but we also want to invest very thoughtfully and strategically and that balance is really going to be – let’s keep at – and starting to make sure we are doing the right thing but i do think that’s an opportunity to keep offsetting some of our investments with additional cost saves as we go throughout this year and the  million worth of noninterest expense for the core  million if you take out the – the kind of onetimers i think we are going to see just a singledigit  small singledigit type – certainly less than  or  or less over the last many years chris mcgratty thanks a lot randall conte sure operator operator instructions and our next question comes from brian martin with fig partners please go ahead brian martin good morning mitchell feiger good morning brian randall conte good morning brian brian martin so maybe just a couple housekeeping things randy the capital markets’ revenue was off a little bit this quarter i guess and i think maybe since you talked about – some of you talked about maybe swaps being a little bit lower but just if you can guess more of an anomaly i guess what – anything to think about going forward in that number mark hoppe brian it’s mark hoppe i’ll take that one yes we do think it’s an anomaly actually rates did bump up a little bit and looks like they were trending up and that probably had an impact on some of our clients’ views going forward but no we feel very good about that group and the opportunities that we have with existing clients  with new clients and so we think that’s what – i don’t think we are ever going to say we are going to have a straightline growth in that type of fee income category we think that the dip in the first quarter is good of an anomaly no i wouldn’t worry about it randall conte yes this is randy i wouldn’t worry about it brian and i also would go back and just look at the five quarter trend on that line it’s fairly nice in terms of the growth that we’ve seen in over the last couple of years and it’s – the swap side of the equation is only few hundred thousand dollars half a million brian martin yes okay okay good thanks and then just the other couple things randy jut the comments you had about the accretion and i don’t recall the previous i guess guidance with the stock ops this was on the accretion but just in general the commentary on the accretion is just a – there is nothing more significant decline expected over the next couple of quarters is that fair or consistent with what you said before randall conte yes again i think of these members like – but it’s somewhat we are in the  million  million worth of accretion in the quarter as we get down about  or  from the prior quarter and  million feels like a good number for me but maybe an opportunity to retreat some of these – what our philosophy is about loan provisioning versus accretion so this has a net impact that’s important here too right sure we’ll go to john as he – so as we go through the income on the discount and we also – as loans renew we take that accretion and write away on those as well so those can bounce around a little bit but on top of that if you take the provisioning on top of that we view a lot of the discount as creditrelated so we are providing i think as we mentioned before on a lot of that accretion so the net impact to the bottomline is not that base because we are providing as we go on this brian martin right okay well if i ask on that one all right and then just an housekeeping just the loan growth in the quarter i mean it sounds as though from mitch’s comments that the – he is optimistic on the commercial loan – i guess the slowdown in this quarter i guess would you attribute it more to kind of what you alluded to last quarter that the american chartered bank has still maybe a little bit out of the market or would you say some of it was a softness or seasonality in the market that was kind of impacting it mark hoppe brian it’s mark we’ve done a pretty careful analysis of this and we’ve come a way that we are pretty convinced that just seasonal in nature there in a portfolio this large there is just a lot of different things that happen we talk a lot about diversification and how diversified our customer base is and that’s really from a seasonal perspective that’s what it feels to us as we did our analysis on this front when the numbers came in at the  numbers came in brian martin okay all right fair enough and just a last two things the – mitch i guess you talked about the loan growth kind of the less assets just the deposit growth more importantly is maybe a bit more challenging and i guess what do you see as kind of a sustainable growth rate in deposits for the deposit mix that you guys aspire to continue to hold going forward i mean is it similar to what you were suggesting on the loan side is that kind of mid to uppersingledigit type of deposit growth in the buckets if you will if you guys want to grow is that how you are thinking about things in much realistic given the market conditions today mitchell feiger so two thoughts certainly deposit growth can be had if you are willing to pay the right products right if you do too much of that it crushes margins and so we are not excited about doing that that’s thought one getting high quality low cost or stable deposit growth especially in chicago our deposit taking branches are to get that at the mid to highsingledigits it’s really hard we are going to work toward that and i’d like to get there but i can’t say that we are going to get there at the moment i assure we would like to we are going to shift some resources i think that encourage that but we’ve got work to do brian martin okay all right just the last one would be maybe one for randy just on the benefits to rate increases i guess if you get a little bit of lens off the current kind of core margin rates i guess if you look over the next four or six quarters with rates likely going higher i mean what are you guys’ view kind of a longerterm sustainable type of margins to the commercialization you guys have and then i guess as a longer term level of stabilizes once you factor in a little bit more benefit like you are saying to come from the bottomline you’ve got more variable rate assets randall conte yes so this is randy i’ll take to answer that but in the current environment i do see our margins right net interest margins increasing slightly as you continue to see the increases in interest rates right and so in terms of the target for that no it’s something that i haven’t – my figures say it’s not something i really want all you to lock into there is some other things that can impact so – but i do – we do see it going up and i think with the increases that are similar to what we have experienced if we see another one or two of those or three of those over the course of the consuming year we expect our balance sheet at this point to react similarly and when we do our – one of the things that someone that commented on – i think last call or maybe in investor day was they were surprised that our – the change in our interest rates from an increase in rates wasn’t larger well i think one was – i’ve been quoting to ramp type increases and some folks quote shocks and so from a ramp perspective our increase stays in that – we project around  million increase for a  increase in rates and versus shock our balance sheet simultaneous shock that’s doubled at least and so that’s about – that’s the color i would provide to the question that you asked but i don’t know if anybody else in the room wants to jump in on there so picks silence there is no brian martin okay all right thanks guys i appreciate taking the questions mitchell feiger we are happy to be asked operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr
