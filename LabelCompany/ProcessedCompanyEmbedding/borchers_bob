engineer bob borchers recounts time at apple updated  am est thu february           by macnn staff talk to students emphasizes innovation former iphone product marketing engineer bob borchers best known for his appearances some of the ilife and iphone guided tour videos recently gave a talk to students at a california school that touched on his time at apple particularly covering the introduction of the iphone and what he is doing now having left the company his talk captured in two youtube videos by an audience member focused on how apple innovates in hopes of fostering creative thinking in his young audiencethe iphone borchers said was the product of steve jobs telling the engineering teams simply that they had to create the first phone people would fall in love with the product had to be a revolutionary mobile phone the best ipod thus far and let users carry the internet in their pocket the latter being a particularly unusual idea at the time he said later in the talk he described the role of the product marketing team as being akin to conductors of an orchestra helping decide what should be in or left out of the iphone and coordinating the many differentlytalented teams to get the goals accomplished borchers reiterated the key concepts that apple has so successfully used to foster innovation to the students do a few things exceptionally well break the rules pay attention to details and make people think differently about their relationship with the device particularly if it was a device that already existed on the market such as mp players or tablets borchers pointed out that many of the things people love about the iphone today  in particular the apps but also the video and photography capabilities the gps and now the voice interaction  were not part of the original mandate in creating a product that revolutionized the industry and broke many rules borchers emphasized particularly in how phones were sold they had naturally created a platform that could continue to surprise and delight customers he particularly dwelt on apples famous attention to detail partially recounting a recentlycirculated story about how the original iphone was intended to have a plastic touchscreen to protect the lcd late in the production process and shortly before its debut jobs showed the engineers that the plastic while protective would scratch when people kept it in their pocket with keys and other items forcing the team to scramble and convince corning to start up production on its thenabandoned gorilla glass which ended up being a better option for both companies borchers mentioned the companys wellknown obsession with product packaging saying that apple spends way too much time on its product presentation but that it effectively communicates to consumers that the product inside is special that it is something apple is proud of and that it is valuable he showed a couple of early iphone ads pointing out that the time in them is always set for  am the moment the iphone was originally launched in another commercial for the original iphone borchers pointed out that the phone number used to demonstrate the google map function was genuine and the actual number of the restaurant mentioned any other company  would have used a fictitious number he added and that the last time he was at pacific catch in san francisco they still had the iphone special which is calamari since leaving apple after the launch of the iphone  borchers has become a venture capitalist with opus capital saying that apple and the iphone had gotten so big and that his passion was more for helping others get their own products off the ground so he left to get small again the youtube videos are posted below tags iphone apple

iphone was not a great phone  trusted reviews skip to content » trending galaxy s xbox one x oneplus  lg g iphone  best laptops nintendo switch iphone  deals ipad pro  best k tvs former iphone senior director original iphone “was not a great phone” by evan kypreos february   bob borchers exapple senior director of product marketing for the original iphone has apologised to owners of the device at mwc launched in  the original is iphone definitey a far cry from the current iphone s but borchers has gone so far as saying the device was only “okay” “if you had the original iphone i apologise it was not a great phone it was an ok phone“ said borchers while speaking at a dolby presentation regarding the future of mobile entertainment   the tongueincheek comment came after borchers now dolby’s chief marketing officer explained how apple changed the smartphone landscape with the launch of the original iphone seven years ago “what was interesting at apple is that technology took a back seat to user interface if you look at the iphone as a technological element everything had been done before it was about bringing all that together into an experience that was compelling and then communicating it as an experience not as a technology”  mpu  desktop  tablet he also claimed that apple actually made mistakes while putting together the customer proposition and marketing the original iphone   “there were three value propositions in order of importance a revolutionary phone the best ipod ever and the internet in your pocket but in fact it should have been the reverse having the internet in your pocket was the most important” he continued by recognising the impact the app community had to the success of the iphone “it was a great ipod but it was the connection to the internet and the app community that made the difference” the focus on the customer’s experience as opposed to the features or list of techy buzz terms is one of the key reasons borchers believes the iphone was a success – leading to hundreds of millions of units sold worldwide of the course of its seven year history that focus of providing the best possible user experience regardless of device is an ethos that he is intent on bringing across platforms – particularly in the mobile and tablet space where so much media is now consumed but which he feels currently are currently suboptimal “our goal as technologists and content creators is to present an uncompromised experience so the goal for us at dolby is to understand how the brain processes audio and video and to present that to the human in the best way possible and to give them the depth of experience in whatever environment they’re in” he concluded  dolby also announced deeper collaborations with chinese giants zte
