tucker good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today welcome to blacklines third official earnings call in our first quarter of the year blackline executed well on the major initiatives that we set for  we are happy to report that total gaap revenue reached  million reflecting a yearoveryear growth rate of  this is a great start particularly in a seasonally slower quarter when many accountants are focused on their yearend financial close rather than investing in software they are at their busiest closing their books for the year completing and filing their financial reports working through audits and frankly doing most of it manually blackline is changing the way finance and accounting works one company at a time in our last two earnings calls ive asked our participants who invest in analyze or work with other companies to think about how those companies might be helped by blackline i am happy to report that several of you have taken action weve had referrals from several investors we even had one person send us a list of companies that had gotten into trouble with their internal controls so i very much appreciate the evangelism and would like to encourage more of you to ask the cfos that you know how they close their books is the process manual and labor intensive have they ever heard of blackline are they interested in efficient accurate cost effective controlled results they can learn more about us in our website at blacklinecom and thank you so much for spreading the word and helping us grow now on to the highlights our broad and diverse customerbase grew to more than  customers around the world we had  net new customers in both enterprise and midmarket across multiple industries and geographies in q we continue to attract customer switches from competitors while this is not our core strategy and represents a small part of our logo acquisitions i am always pleased when we get the opportunity to demonstrate our value to a new but experienced customer our strong net dollar revenue retention rate of  in q demonstrates the stickiness of our solution once customers begin using the product they see the value and begin adding more products and users over time today we offer more products and solutions than at any other point in our history i will talk about that in a minute when we review our  strategic initiatives in q we continue to see strong demand in the market lets talk about some customers who are using blackline solutions or have just recently made the decision to go with blackline the first example id like to tell you about is a large enterprise customer who have been on the continuous accounting journey with blackline for some time this is a global manufacturing company with more than  billion in revenue that started with our financial close management solution in  as the benefits and value of our solution has been proven out over time the company has added more users and more products in six years their user base has grown from  to  endusers worldwide and theyve reduced the time spent globally on their monthly close by  the chief accounting officer tells us that theyve improved their financial statement reporting accuracy and confidence in their reported results given their level of satisfaction and success with our core platform this company decided to trust us to solve another very large problem with more than  different legal entities this company needed a single central source for intercompany activity in mid they purchased blacklines new intercompany hub and went live in q with their first few entities an exciting new customer is a large emea company with over  employees this customer was previously using a competitive product for reconciliations while other portions of the close were being performed manually in spreadsheets they came to blackline looking not only to replace their current process but also to find a cloudbased solution that would provide greater visibility into the overall close process generate better reporting and analytics and enable more efficiency by reducing manual processes the biggest driver of their decision to switch to blackline was our unified cloud model where multiple products work together seamlessly for the end user and eliminate manual data uploads and batch processing across disparate systems it is so encouraging to see more and more companies around the world embrace having financial information in our secure cloud at blackline we were one of the first to offer this type of cloud solution in  and to this day we have gained the confidence and trust of many larger companies previously we highlighted our technical difficulty for this year while it is still early we made good progress on these goals in the first quarter and i would like to share some of that progress with you in  we are really focusing on all aspects of the customer journey each customer is at some point on the road that we call continuous accounting perhaps we should call it the continuous accounting freeway in any case this is a transformation and process evolution whereby companies break up large periodend batch processes into smaller daily pieces that are automated wherever possible the results and benefits are many exceptions and potential problems can be identified in almost real time and dealt with immediately this reduces risk and allows for agile business management by automating broad ph processes more time is able to be spent upon value added business analysis our customers have told us that the overtime hours at the end of the period can be substantially reduced controls are inherent and documented throughout many process audits can run more smoothly and many times can be conducted remotely but best of all we built software that improves the lives of accountants and transform how they do their jobs we first coined the term continuous accounting to describe this journey back in  we are delighted that analysts and other companies are starting to adopt this language in their descriptions of their own research and products its so accurately describes the transformation that can happen when a company gets on this journey a very important part of the customer journey is the endtoend customer experience blackline has seen terrific success because from the very beginning weve been focused on taking care of our customers providing incredible value and honoring and festering close relationships with them you may know that last year we hired a chief customer officer she has responsibility for the entire lifecycle of the customer experience from initial demonstration through implementation support and customer success this nonstandard approach gives us an opportunity to better streamline the customer experience so that golive can happen faster adoption rates are higher and handoff between departments happens more smoothly in q as an example based on improvements and implementation times and started to measure individual customer satisfaction more closely we are improving our customer engagement model by hiring more customer success people they are very popular with our customers better defining the ownership of accounts and creating more alignment across sales marketing and service teams and reviewing our communication plans for all types of customer communications including maintenance windows release notes usage metrics et cetera we feel weve made great progress to better serve the needs of our customers another initiative in  is to incorporate more strategic products into our deals our core platform and associated solutions will continue to be the primary engine of growth we believe this represents the largest current market opportunity and where we have established leadership position and market awareness we are also building capabilities around strategic products such as the intercompany hub and smart close where we see a bright future our success in going to market with these products will further cement our leadership position and help drive larger deal sizes we are happy to report that in q we sold one of our largest deals in company history which included the intercompany hub we continue to see a trend of rising demand and also rising price points related to the intercompany hub in q ecosystem partners play a key role in providing expertise and transformational services that pair well with blackline software we are making good progress towards having more formalized partnerships with some major consulting partners and are in the market with them now it is still very early with these partnerships but we remain optimistic that they will help us generate larger deals that include more strategic products from a product perspective in the first quarter we focus on platform improvements that make our customers happy for example we continue to make progress on the integration of our smart close product enhanced reporting and dashboarding making the variance analysis of seamless of every clients close and building our additional connectors to other erps while this may not be the most exciting news for all of you it is important to the users of the system and the customers that have asked for these enhancements many of our users log their enhancement requests on our community board and we play close attention to what theyre asking for were pleased that  is up to a strong start i want to thank blacklines employees customers and partners for helping us achieve our successes to date we have a tremendous market opportunity ahead of us and we remain focused on our key initiatives to continue driving growth we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress now ill ask mark to discuss the financials and then well open the call to questions mark partin thank you therese and good afternoon everyone ill quickly mention that during my remarks today with the exception of total revenue all numbers are nongaap we are pleased to begin the year with strong first quarter results total revenue increased  yearoveryear to  million reflecting strong global demand for our solutions and solid performance against our  initiatives and growth plans we added  net new customers in q which brings our total customer count to  at march  this represents yearoveryear growth of  and includes a healthy and consistent mix of enterprise and midmarket customers international revenue continued to grow in q representing  of the total up from  in the first quarter of  we achieved a net revenue retention rate of  as our existing customers are consistently expanding their footprint with blackline over time this is thanks to product upsells user expansion and continued price increases along with strong renewal rates we continue to add finance and accounting professionals who rely on us to make their daily lives easier in q the total number of blackline users grew to over  this user growth is an increase of  versus a yearago and came from new and existing customers that are expanding their footprint on our platform its important to note that we are also beginning to sell an increasing number of products that are not based on number of users which may result in some variability in our user growth rates first quarter gross margin remained strong exceeding  and reflecting our consistent mix of high subscription revenue of  in q we accelerated our investments and continued to first expand our global marketing and sales force capacity second invest in rd to build our strategic products capabilities and third invest in people to drive our customer engagement model our investments remain disciplined and balanced and in q we continue to see operating leverage in the business total operating expense improved to  of revenue compared to  of revenue in the first quarter of  our strong top line growth solid gross margin and improved operating leverage allowed us to operate more profitably and drop most of the revenue overperformance in q to the bottom line we narrowed our operating loss in the quarter to  million a substantial improvement from an operating loss of  million a year ago on a quarterly basis our operating loss will vary but annually we expect to trend positively toward our target model first quarter net loss improved to  million or  per share which compares to net loss of  million or  per share in q of  the weighted average common shares used to calculate first quarter eps was  million shares in  and  million shares in the  period free cash flow was a negative  million in q reflecting investments in our planned growth initiative and the cyclicality and seasonality of our business such as the payment of annual corporate bonuses our cash flow varies on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis we anticipate our cash flow to trend positively we ended the first quarter with  million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities we remain on track to turn cash flow and operating income positive in q of this year i wanted to take this opportunity to make one additional point about the financial impact of the runbook acquisition in q runbook had a positive impact to our deferred revenue for the quarter related to annual maintenance billings in previous quarters runbook had sales of licenses which created a onetime positive impact to our deferred revenue going forward we do not expect to sell a material amount of licensebased contracts as we continue to convert runbook to assess subscription based model which will normalize deferred revenue in our prior earnings calls weve gotten questions about implied billings which would be impacted by the change in deferred revenue as you know we do not report our guide on implied billings and do not have plans to do so in the future we have consistently cautioned that implied billings can have quarterly variability and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future growth now ill turn to our guidance for the second quarter and fullyear  for q total gaap revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million this reflects a yearoveryear growth rate of  to  compared to total revenue of  million in the second quarter of  we anticipate that nongaap net loss will be in the range of  million to  million utilizing fully diluted weighted average shares of  million we expect nongaap net loss per share of  to  for the fullyear  we are increasing our guidance for total gaap revenue to a range of  million to  million this reflects a growth rate of  to  over total revenue of  million in  nongaap net loss in  is expected to be between  million and  million utilizing a fully diluted weighted average share count of  million we expect nongaap net loss per share to be in the range of  to  were happy to see such a strong demand environment and we believe our market leadership position product innovation and sales and marketing strength will lead to continued success for blackline in  now therese and i would be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jesse hulsing from goldman sachs your question please jesse hulsing yes thank you i wanted to drill a little bit more into intercompany hub and i guess im curious one how are your expectations for that product trending versus where you started the year and two if you look at i guess deal sizes for that product how are those coming in versus or shaping up versus what your expectations were which i think was  to  per customer or something in that range thank you therese tucker hi jesse its therese and what we mentioned at our last earnings call is that we are seeing an upward trend with the ich price point that continues to be so and what were not doing right now is releasing that number because we keep  we havent seen the ceiling on it yet okay so im not going to  i will say you have to  if im happy with the trending and the demand i am very happy with both the pipeline and the demand that were seeing for ich jesse hulsing great fantastic and mark just really quickly on the user growth i mean if you look at kind of net adds quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear growth there were some desal ph there it sounds like thats because youre moving towards more consumptionbased purchasing plan so maybe  is user growth the right metric to look at is that going to become increasingly detached i guess from underlying bookings trends in revenue growth thanks guys mark partin yes jesse thanks i think it was more pronounced for those reasons in q because we were off the mark pretty successful in strategic products my view was in talking to you guys that we would be facing this issue beginning in  i think the detachment starts occurring this year so as we go through the year well be pointing out the nature of that user growth having said that q is traditionally a seasonal quarter for us as therese said and were happy with that number we had a strong q from midmarket midmarket traditionally has lower user count so i dont want to make too much out of it at this point but its certainly the variability well be looking at for the reasons that you mentioned operator does that answer your question okay our next question comes from the line of bhavan suri from william blair your question please bhavan suri thanks thanks for taking my questions and nice job obviously there i just want to touch a little bit on the midmarket here you obviously had a solid quarter for midmarket do the partners have the same positive impact in midmarket or is that sort of much more a direct sales approach on your side to capture those customers just some color on how does that market is different and obviously the large market where youve got the large accounting firms up and that may be helping how do we think about the gotomarket in the midmarket therese tucker you know bhavan thats actually very interesting question its therese hi by the way and thank you we actually have more than  or  different partners and many of them actually do focus on midmarket now because the midmarket in general the deal sizes are smaller the names are not quite as flashy tends to be missed sometimes but we also have a very active partner network for that particular group as well bhavan suri thats really helpful therese and hi and then one quick one for me when you look at the partners and their ramp up intercompany hub its the one were tracking because obviously its a bigger product bigger deal sizes youre seeing bigger wins because of it how the partners shaping up around that particular product therese tucker we view the partners to be really instrumental with the intercompany product simply because the product itself is great software but it requires a company to many times not always but many times transform how they operate with intercompany transactions and partners are a perfect way to get that transformation to actually happen so i love the partnerships that were developing right now and if you saw in deloittes press release today they mentioned the intercompany product pretty heavily bhavan suri great therese that was really helpful thanks for taking my questions guys and congrats again therese tucker thanks bhavan mark partin thanks bhavan operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob oliver for baird your question please rob oliver hey guys thanks very much therese tucker hi rob rob oliver hi how are you so therese a question for you and then quick followup for mark therese can you talk a little bit about the dealsizing environment this quarter i know you mentioned that you had closed one of your largest deals ever so just generally deal sizes i mean it what otherwise would have been a very busy quarter for your customers and then intercompany hub and whether that would have been included in that sort of a deal therese tucker yes rob they are growing very nicely im watching my garden grow and intercompany hub was about half of that largest deal to date rob oliver okay its great thanks and mark just on the  and just a followup to jesses question on the customer count number not to make too much of it but just so i understand it does sound like as intercompany hub and insights and some of these new products get traction there might be tendency to read that new customer number as not as good but actually seem starts like it might be an indicator of traction with these products just want to make sure were understanding that properly thank you guys mark partin yes no problem rob thanks for that so just to be clear its the user count that you mean and for us in q in particular as a data point we had really good momentum in uptake in the existing accounts on the nonuser based strategic products as therese mentioned and we have more of those today than we have had previously and so you wont see that show up in the user count separately in q we had more midmarket momentum and midmarket isnt as user  its not as many users so as we go forward what were doing is triangulating the business like in q where you had an uptick to  from the revenue retention rate you see that being sold and driven by strategic products those arent driving the user count and you also see that customer base was up nicely over  in the quarter as well in the seasonal quarter and the user count you can see hangs there for the reasons that i mentioned related to strategic products that arent based on users so in future quarters when you see a number in users we will be balancing strategic products with user base products and so that number will get more variable and well just be drilling down on that each quarter as we go through  rob oliver great thank you guys very much for taking my questions therese tucker thanks rob operator thank you your next question comes from the line of terry tillman from raymond james your question please terry tillman hi good afternoon hi therese and mark great job in the quarter therese tucker hi terry thanks mark partin hi terry terry tillman first question is just related to maybe an update specifically on the sap relationship historically you guys have had a nice growing in relationship and so how is that playing out and then kind of related to that though you get a lot of questions about erp vendors friend versus foe maybe talk about kind of how that balances at this point therese tucker okay we have a terrific relationship with sap this quarter revenue from sap was  and its in line with our expectations we enjoyed working with them that continues to be the case now in terms of other erps that you mentioned most tend to be very neutral of course oracle has had a competing product for some time now but it really hasnt impacted our business and everybody else seems to be very neutral terry tillman got it and then mark a quick question in terms of  i know you dont guide the billings and we need to be careful with that metric but are you suggesting that there was something outlier like from the acquired business in the first quarter or maybe you could be quantifying that and then should that become more of a headwind that we should think about into the second quarter and again congratulations mark partin great yes thanks terry yes thats exactly what i was doing in my comment because i dont generally talk about implied billings but in the last three quarters weve had specific or unique circumstances related to the runbook acquisition that affected deferred revenue and our implied billings calculation in q as an example we had maintenance billing we concentrated and built all in the first quarter as a result of their customercycle that added  points to the billing growth rate  implied billings growth rate and so what i want you to know is that those  is for us to be completely transparent about the last several quarters and what was driven by runbook and that those dont continue on youd see a more normalized billings rate going forward terry tillman thanks mark partin okay operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark murphy from jp morgan your question please matthew coss hi good afternoon thank you this is matt coss on for mark murphy therese you talked about a couple of large customers you won this quarter that had been using other vendors and is it typical that when organizations switch to blackline they tend to be large and are they ever moving off of multiple products when they switch to you therese tucker well thats an interesting question matt rarely do they move from multiple products okay unless  well that could happen if theyve used the competing products in different areas perhaps usually if theyve tried it one area and it hasnt been terribly successful and so when they want to do a global rollout they will typically go with blackline we have switches both at the midmarket level as well as the enterprise level of course the enterprise level is where you kind of get excited but we see it across the board matthew coss sure thank you and then sort of just going through your k it looks like your backlog grew  last year as of the end of the year although we dont have much in the way of historical backlog for comparison how do you view that how would you view the current business trajectory relative to that strong growth you had last year and does it continue i mean is everything you saw last year that sort of persisted into this year regarding pipeline and your sales funnel and all of that mark partin yes thanks matt i think youre talking about the  in the k the contract backlog for a multiyear deals that arent  havent been built and the composition of that is that we sign multiyear deals today a growing percentage of our businesses are on multiyear term deals now we bill annually and thats consistent and so you see that rise in by virtue of just growth in the business and sales but also in growth in multiyear deals so we dont  i wouldnt draw any direct lines from that i would simply focus on the guidance that we give matthew coss thanks very much therese tucker thanks matt operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of brent bracelin from pacific crest securities your question please brent bracelin thanks for taking the question here therese lets start with deloitte obviously want to walk through some scenarios here is this an exclusive does this preclude you from working with the other big four vendors out there and then if you look at deloittes lloyds just customer base i think they have  of the fortune  over  kind of midmarket kind of companies that they service have you looked at the overlap between kind of your customer base and their customer base just provide us a little more color on that deloitte opportunity is it exclusive or not and what it means to the business therese tucker well first off brent we dont do exclusive partnerships and i dont believe that deloitte does either right because if you do that then you lose some level of independence and so on that we dont do exclusive partnerships i will say however that we are the only vendor in this space that deloitte has that partnership with okay so read what you might into that and i dont think they have any other press releases out there that are quite as nice as the one that they did for us today so that is great we have a great working relationship with them we are of course looking at who their customers are and where there are synergies that we can leverage across the board we enjoy working with them we also have very good partnerships in place with other big four right not completely commercialized yet but we have good working relationships with them as well brent bracelin fair enough and then how is that whats the gotomarket going to be like is this reference selling is this deloitte going to have a bigger presence at your blackline events walk us through kind of how that relationship potentially could evolve over time therese tucker one of the nice things about this partnership is that it does now allow us to gotomarket together and that you are absolutely spoton when you say things like a bigger presence at our user conference joint gotomarket activities going out and working together to help companies transform their financial processes thats all part of it and thats one of the reasons that were sort of happy about getting it actually finally down on paper brent bracelin very helpful thank you and then second question for me is really around the runbook smart close product is that kind of tracking in line with your expectations any update there therese tucker were not breaking it out separately right now but it is absolutely meeting my expectations it is a super solid really highperforming product that really brings the reality of robotic process automation to our customers they see incredible benefits from it and its in place in a lot of different very large companies and working very well so im very pleased with that acquisition in spite of the blurbs in the financials that it keeps giving mark brent bracelin well one more question for you therese here and mark id love to ask you a question but the bet things are pretty clean on the financial front my last question for you therese early is on kind of intercompany hub here i know that product has been out there its had fits and starts for the last kind of  first year of its existence the last two quarters it just sounds like its really starting to build some momentum here so walk me through kind of why is there so much appeal for that product what is it addressing from a painpoint standpoint and i know we do want to get ahead of ourselves here but it definitely feels like theres some momentum building on that product im just trying to understand why why now therese tucker yes thank you youre almost asking me to do an intercompany hub commercial im so excited okay there are a number of initiatives that are happening right now there is something called the bef ph initiative and thats where there is  how you did the transactions that cross borders okay another words lets say that youre england and im in france and we move some money back and forth because we have some services right if you dont have good accounting around that both countries can claim that as income and tax it okay now if you dont even track it if you dont even book it to the right account then youre going to have taxing authorities from both countries going after the full amounts and the reality is most companies dont have good accounting around this they have very very manual processes thats one area were seeing within the united states the irs is revising the code to require companies to better account for intercompany loans what does that actually mean lets say that youre one division and you dont have any money in your bank doesnt really matter youre part of a bigger company right but that roll forwards more than a month or two it suddenly becomes an intercompany loan the irs wants to know about it again if youve got very manual processes in place and youre not tracking this the penalties that you can be subject to are massive so were seeing this across the board and we are seeing it actually dropdown at a fairly lower level these types of issues are just sort of the  some of the risk mitigations but there are others theres a ton of manual labor that goes into this okay let me give you an example settlement process lets say youre a company with  different entities those  different entities may all be able to trade with each other at the end of the month youve got to manually create a matrix of who owes who what so it gets very very complicated and adds for a lot of manual hours lots of reasons i hope that helped brent bracelin very helpful mark partin yes and we are seeing as therese mentioned this is mark and im sure you expected me to say this but the momentum and demand and interest we see there were guiding to a longterm market opportunity there bright future and not material to this financial year on the revenue brent bracelin thanks for the color therese tucker thank you for asking operator thank you and this does conclude the questionandanswer session of todays program id like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks therese tucker hey thanks everybody for joining and we look forward to our next quarters earning call thank you mark partin thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in todays conference this does conclude the program you may now disconnect

to you if it isn’t meaningful in any way it’s best to keep searching if you’ve themed your furniture and décor around a certain color or idea that can get you started in your search many paintings and other artwork have a cultural theme such as aboriginal art or japanese art on the other hand black and white photography goes great with anything whatever style you choose just make sure it represents your tastes interests or history check out every type of wall art out thereif you’re looking for paintings that fit perfectly with your traditional décor consider fine art prints these are a great alternative if you can’t afford genuine picasso paintings or works by other famous artists pencil art and some sculptures can also fit in well with a traditional scheme if you’re in the mood for some modern artwork illustrations and mixed media are a great place to start sculptures made from metal or glass can also have a modern tone try going bold with abstract paintings urban art or pop art which tend to incorporate more modern influences like graffiti and celebrities plus bright colors photographs work well with any décor as they can cross between modern and traditional easily depending on the subject matter don’t be afraid to mix and match either a modern piece can go amazingly well with a traditional home and vice versa arrange your new artwork for optimal viewingonce you’ve found those perfect meaningful pieces you’ll want to place them in a spot that allows everyone who passes by to admire them common locations for artwork include above a seating area or better yet facing your seating arrangement proper lighting and visibility is also important as is hanging your new pieces at the correct height aim for eye level or the gallery standard which says the center of your paintings should be approximately  inches from the floor embed photo open photo in new window pagetype pagebrowseproductproducttopic topicproductprice pricelevel united states united kingdom australia
