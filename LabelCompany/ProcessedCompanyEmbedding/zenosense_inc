incorporated on august   is focused on commencing the business of developing specialized and noninvasive disease sensory devices the companys focus is on products designed to detect methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa staphylococcus aureus sa when present in healthcare environments and to detect the presence of lung cancer in a patient the companys product is focused on sampling the air and continuously monitoring the airborne the volatile organic compounds vocs signatures emitted by mrsasa the companys device with a single sensor is focused on performing the entire voc spectrum scan as the adaptive processing software enables it to perform various scans creating multiple virtual sensors from a single sensor at the detection stage the voc detection intends to electronically process and pattern process in a neural network the mrsasa voc signatures are emitted when the bacteria has infected and expressed itself as a disease in the patient the companys device is intended to be produced in two forms a wearablebedpositioned device powered by a rechargeable battery to be positioned on the person patients and medical staff and in the event of any infection the mrsa device intends to detect the vocs produced by the infected person and express an audiovisual alarm and an adapted fixed device positioned in the room mains powered with cultureamplification of any mrsasa presence to monitor the room volume which would be network monitoredthe lung cancer technology is focused on three phases of development the phase i focuses on a review of current research on lung cancer biomarkers and an analysis of hospital research phase ii is focused on a series of tests for sensitivity and specificity of the developed sensor as applied to the selected biomarkers meeting the specificity threshold and phase iii is focused on planning the prototyping of a zenosense device for lung cancer detection the mrsa technologys development stages include phase i wherein a prototype of mrsasa detection device is produced phase ii which focuses on producing a mrsa device ready and used to test over  mrsa colonized patients and phase iii which focuses on completing over two months of hospitalbased intensive testing by hospital personnel to test the sensibility specificity and accuracy of the zenosense mrsa devicethe company competes with cepheid nerac and fcubed »
