the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures in our second quarter  earnings press release which will be furnished to the sec on form k and is available on nxps website in the investor relations section at nxpcom id like to now turn the call over to rick richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks jeff and welcome everyone to our earnings call today nxp finished q with solid performance revenue was up  sequentially and most business lines delivering better than planned results we drove strong earnings growth as a result of positive fall through on the incrementally higher revenue and good operating expense control looking at the specifics revenue in q was  billion an increase of  year on year an increase of just over  versus the prior quarter this was better than the midpoint of our guidance as the secure connected devices secure interface  infrastructure and auto groups all delivered better than anticipated results looking at the hpms segment revenue was  billion an increase of  year on year and an increase of just over  from the prior quarter from an operating segment perspective the results are as follows in automotive revenue was  million up  million and  sequentially and slightly better than the midpoint of guidance growth in the quarter was driven by growth in all product lines with particularly strong demand for auto mcu products during the quarter demand was driven by a good crosssection of our major tier  customers with some notable acceleration in japan as we continue to make progress with major local customers design win momentum in automotive market was robust during the quarter we were awarded a major vx program with a top three leading global oem the solution pools products from all the major areas of our portfolio additionally during the quarter hella announced its plan to adopt nxps next generation  gigahertz radar solution we are now designed in with  of the top  tier  suppliers for the complete next generation radar solutions both rf front end and the back end processing engines where we are already the market leader and lastly our infotainment solutions continue to be adopted by major suppliers for next generation programs we continue to view the global auto market and production rates as generally stable with indications that the global unit production will trend towards  in  in line with our growth perspective of  to  compounded annually through  we see auto demand is stable in all major markets while we have heard concerns over peaking global saar we reiterate that our growth is primarily a function of content growth while we cannot ignore the unit production influences on our business so far we have not seen any material changes turning now to secure connected devices revenue was  million up  million or  sequentially incrementally above the midpoint of our guidance range within our mobile transaction group we experienced strong seasonal improvements as a result of both our largest smartphone customer as well as good traction on new models from korean and chinese oems we are continuing to see the mobile transit unit in china gain traction as an example xiaomi launched a consumer awareness program in the shenzhen subway system referencing its mi pay mobile transit payment solution oems are also noting positive activation rates of the mobile transit app in new phones as well as repeated topup of mobile prepaid solutions demand for contactless point of sale reader products was in line with expectations primarily as oems continue to deploy readers in support of contactless rollouts in china in the remainder of that cd business mcu revenue was flattish as we saw good demand for bit kinetis mcu and imx application processors but this was offset by the rolloff of legacy bit micros in the semicustom mobile sensor hub program we also saw some seasonal rebound in our mobile audio business the design win momentum for the imx family continues to be very robust especially in the automotive market for instrument and infotainment clusters in mobile transactions our goto market strategy of working jointly with chinese handset oems and the transit system operators on mobile transit payment systems continues to progress well with programs in process across all  major cities in china this effort will take some time but we believe we are enabling a unique capability which is resonating with the consumers now turning to sii our interface and communications infrastructure group revenue was  million up  million or  sequentially slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range with two of the three product lines experiencing growth in the quarter in the interface group demand was strong and slightly ahead of plan due to seasonal handset trends similar to what we saw in the mobile transactions group the excess inventory situation in highspeed interface which impacted the company late last year has been cleaned up and we believe our revenue is well aligned with our customers production levels id like to reiterate that our largest handset customer while still very important to nxp only represents a mid singledigit percentage of the total company revenue in the rf power market revenue increased sequentially but was below plan due to program pushouts in base station markets in china and india we believe given the continued unpredictability of the base station supply chain our visibility more than a quarter out will always be challenged in the digital networking market we saw weaker than anticipated demand with the revenue from the service provider enterprise and smart home end markets all declining and revenue from cloud edge and industrial markets were both flat during the quarter as some of you may have seen in the trade press during the quarter we took actions to rightsize the digital networking business to align our rd investments to what we view as the slower growth in the served end markets we will continue to focus our efforts on areas where our capabilities are aligned with the customer requirement this continues to be a very good business with high return on investment attractive profitability and high barriers to entry we believe we have found a reasonable base from which we can drive profitable growth over the longer term both in continuing our powerpc and investing in our armbased multicore products within sis demand trends continue to be mixed with revenue coming in at  million down  sequentially in line with our guidance in the nonchina banking card market much of the unit growth opportunity continues to be lowend contact products this is an area where our participation has been quite selective given the aggressive pricing and margin pressure our competitor has taken who clearly has a much different profitability requirement in china our leadership position in the contactless dual interface space continues to be strong that we have clearly entered the period of card replacement and incremental demand is expected to be driven by smaller tenders at tier  and tier  banking institutions in egov the tenders we highlighted last quarter provided some sequential growth and we were awarded an extension on the german electronic passport program while a positive change the egovernment market continues to be extremely lumpy and hard to predict with any level of accuracy now turning to standard products segment revenue was  million about  million better than the high end of guidance reflecting an increase of  from the prior quarter and a  yearonyear decline we are pleased with the results especially given our announcement to sell this business that we expect to close in early  now turning to our distribution channel performance the total months of inventory in the distribution channel held steady at  months with absolute dollars of inventory increasing  million on a sequential basis our channel inventory is in good shape and we will continue to target supply at  months plus or minus a half month also i want to update you on our private equity investors who became nxp shareholders as a result of the freescale acquisition which have liquidated most of their positions you may recall when we closed the freescale merger the private equity investors owned approximately  million shares or about  of the nxp shares outstanding as a result of the recent sales the private equity investors now own less than  of the outstanding shares and we are working with them on cleaning up the remaining shares in summary q was a solid quarter with the strong financial performance a positive reflection on the progress towards the goals we laid out at our analyst day in april given what we view as an end market demand environment which is generally subdued we will focus on actions we can directly influence and control including our cost and expense structure to date the merger integration continues to make good progress the operations team are working well together synergy capture is on track and beginning to accelerate portfolio and roadmaps are meshing better than we originally planned our sales team are focused on realizing the full potential of the solutions offered from our industryleading portfolio wed like to thank all of our employees for their active participation and the hard work in the progress to date we know we have more work ahead we remain committed and focused to maximizing shareholder value creation we continue to believe nxp is ideally positioned over the long term to drive profitable growth in excess of our targeted end markets now id like to pass the call to dan for a review of our financial performance dan daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks rick and good morning to everyone on todays call we delivered good performance in q with the key highlights being we delivered revenue that was above the midpoint of guidance we continued solid execution on nongaap gross margins we tightly controlled our operating expenses resulting in better fall through and stronger nongaap operating margin and when taken together drove nongaap eps towards the high end of our guidance we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter and deployed just under  billion in share repurchases and gross debt reduction turning to the specifics of the quarter we delivered revenue of  billion in q up  sequentially and a nongaap gross margin of  the third consecutive quarter of  or greater nongaap gross margin within our hpms segment revenue was  billion up  over the previous quarter nongaap gross margin for the segment was  and nongaap operating margin for the segment was  within our standard products segment revenue was  million up  versus q nongaap gross margin for the segment was  and nongaap operating margin for the segment was  total nxp nongaap operating margin in q was  up  basis points sequentially and above the midpoint of our guidance this basis point improvement demonstrates strong progress in driving synergy capture interest expense in the quarter was  million cash paid for income taxes was  million and noncontrolling interest was  million all of this taken together resulted in total nongaap earnings per share of  or  better than the midpoint of our guidance stockbased compensation which is not included in our nongaap earnings was  million now turning to the balance sheet total debt at the end of q was  billion with a cash balance of  billion results in net debt of  billion during the quarter we redeemed  million of our  senior unsecured notes due in september  additionally we refinanced  billion of our existing bonds and term loans with new senior unsecured notes issued in the quarter we exited the quarter with a trailing month adjusted ebitda of approximately  billion a ratio of net debt to trailing month adjusted ebitda at the end of q was  times and our nongaap interest coverage was  times please note our net leverage ratio only reflects partial trailing month contribution from freescale if we were to assume a full year contribution of freescales adjusted ebitda the net leverage ratio would have been  times during the quarter we repurchased  million shares at a cost of approximately  million or  per share this brings our total yeartodate share repurchases to  million or  million shares at an average price of  turning to working capital our days of inventory were  receivables were  days and payables were  days taken together our cash conversion cycle was  days these nongaap measures include the assets and liabilities held for sale as detailed on our balance sheet cash flow from operations was  million and net capex was  million resulting in a nongaap free cash flow of  million before i turn to our expectations for the third quarter i would like to highlight the press release we issued last night regarding a new debt financing we are opportunistically taking advantage of an attractive debt market by adding  million to our existing  notes we will use a portion of the net proceeds to repay the remaining  million on our  senior unsecured notes due in september  with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes as you have noticed in our q earnings release starting with the third quarter of  nxp will limit its forward guidance to the following gaap financial information revenue gross profit operating income financial income and expense noncontrolling interest and net cash paid for income taxes in addition nxp will limit the nongaap financial measures in its forward guidance and subsequent results to nongaap gross profit nongaap operating income and nongaap financial income and expense these changes are being made to be in compliance with the newly issued recommendations from the sec concerning the presentation of nongaap financial measures we currently anticipate q revenue will be in a range of  billion to  billion at the midpoint we expect revenue to be about  billion in q we expect the following trends in the business auto is expected to be flat to slightly down in the lowsingledigit range secure connected devices is expected to be up in the range of midteens to about  secure interface  infrastructure is expected to be up in a range of low to highsingle digits secure identification solutions is expected to be down in the range of highsingle to lowdouble digits standard products is expected to be up in the range of low to midsingle digits we anticipate revenue from manufacturing corporate and other to be approximately  million at the midpoint we expect nongaap gross margin to be  plus or minus  basis points and nongaap operating margin to be  plus or minus  basis points interest expense will be flat at approximately  million cash paid for income taxes is expected to be roughly  million noncontrolling interest should be about  million stockbased compensation should be flat sequentially at about  million which is excluded from our nongaap guidance lastly consistent with historical practice to assist you in your modeling efforts please assume a flat share count so in summary we delivered solid execution in q indicative of how quickly the combined teams are aligning and executing we delivered better revenue excellent nongaap gross margin and nongaap earnings per share ahead of guidance we continued generating strong free cash flow robust cash flow will allow us to continue to fund a consistent and wellbalanced capital allocation strategy going forward in the first half of  we deployed nearly  billion in share repurchases and gross debt reduction alone so continued strong execution in q but the team recognizes there is a significant body of work ahead of us and remains focused on delivering strong execution with that id now like to turn the call back to the operator for your questions operator questionandanswer session operator certainly our first question comes from the line of john pitzer of credit suisse your line is now open john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah thanks for letting me ask the question rick i wanted to first go to the auto business you talked about in your prepared comments having design wins with  of the top  oems for the complete radar solution can you help me better understand what the dollar content that would represent and i guess more importantly where are we in the ramp of that and how is that going to look over the next call it  to  months richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director so john i think the key is the design wins its a typical automotive product and the actual ramp of revenue will take place over the next few years it wont be over the next few quarters i think the key for us is winning those design wins ensuring that we offered the best solution and the architecture of each one of those solutions by each one of the oems will be slightly different with some of those having three or four sensors or front ends to go along with the microcontroller and some of them being as large as doubledigit radar sensors to go along with the controller so the architecture is quite different by each individual customer the key for us is being in a position where we can continue to lead from a technical view point and be sure that we are the leader in the design wins to be able to really be preeminent position as the volume really begins to ramp over the next few years as the auto companies bring this significant safety item on to be able to drive assisted driving and improving the safety of driving john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful and then rick for my followup just going back to the sis business if you look at the guidance for the september quarter it implies that the business will be down over  year over year do you guys feel as though this is approaching a trough if so why and youve always been good about allocating capital to the right businesses in your portfolio have you taken cost actions as you think about maybe this tam not being as large as you would have thought maybe  to  months ago richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director so john really i think the important thing about this is this is the security technology that is fundamental for us to be able to drive a secure connected solutions across the board so the fundamental technology associated with this we provide across a broad array of portfolio now in addition to that we have the sis business itself with the bank cards and the egovernment side egovernments going to continue to be quite lumpy we continue to do very well in the china banking card business but you know thats at a level where its going to be more of a replacement basis than the growth that weve seen over the last few years associated with it for the rest of the market which is really focused today theyre not worried about the convenience of the consumer theyre focused on the lowest cost solution which is a contact emv solution and we have the competitor there that doesnt seem to have the same profit requirements that we do so were being extremely selective in our participation in the market and thats having some dampening effect on our solutions were obviously going to be sure that we align our cost with the expectations associated with that but at the same time we will project our security capability and technology to be able to fan that out broadly across our entire portfolio as we think thats a significant leadership position that we have in being able to drive solutions on a broader basis john william pitzer  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from ross seymore of deutsche bank your line is now open matt diamond  deutsche bank securities inc hey good morning guys this is actually matt diamond on ross behalf nice job on the synergies in q as operating marginwise could you give us an update on where we stand in terms of capturing the synergies right now and whats left to be done going forward daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah thanks for the question i think what weve always said about synergies is watch the operating margin we want to be measured on an operating margin roadmap thats reflective of synergy capture as well as operating a disciplined business what you noticed in the recent quarter q is a  basis point sequential improvement in operating margin on a flat gross margin and if you look at the midpoint of the guide on an operating margin basis into q  you see a  basis point uplift in a sixmonth period with very little contribution from a gross margin basis if you roughly think this is a  billion business and youre looking at  basis points of margin improvement in a twoquarter period i think it pretty quickly gets you to the map that shows the synergy capture is very very strongly on track and were happy with the profitability uplift that this companys seeing from those efforts matt diamond  deutsche bank securities inc excellent and on the cash return side could you update us on the approach to cash returns between now and the standard product sale and how do you plan to balance the cash returns after you hit the planned two times leverage daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president so i think well start with what our capital allocation strategy is we talked about being very balanced between debt and equity until we get to a two times net leverage position and so if you think that the proceeds from the sale just given other debt we have outstanding needs to be used to primarily repay debt or acquire additional assets to increase the asset base of the company it pretty much locks us into one side of that equation addressing the leverage of the company i would say we will balance that perspective with a heavier focus in the near term on share repurchase so that by the time we are exiting q next year youll see a more balanced approach to share repurchase and debt repurchase based on our capital allocation strategy than just the use of proceeds from the sale of the divested assets would suggest richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director yeah i guess one thing if i could add to that i think our confidence in being able to close the standard products transaction continues to improve with the regulators and so that gives us a good comfort level of the cash that will be available to us early next year and so between now and then we want to be sure that were opportunistic in doing whats in the best interest of shareholders matt diamond  deutsche bank securities inc excellent thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from stacy rasgon of bernstein research your line is now open stacy aaron rasgon  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi guys thanks for taking my questions first i wanted to ask about the guide for secure connected devices its up midteens almost to maybe  i think more than half of this business is actually industrial microcontrollers as well as the mobile payments and everything is in there can you give us some feeling for whats driving the strong guide how much of it is coming from mobile payments versus the broader industrial microcontroller business versus like the handset audio business richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director so the guide for q stacy is strong across the board its not really in any particular area if you look at that that also includes our mobile wallet business which is seasonally strong in q with the rollout of new models associated with it as well as the momentum that we have with china on the transit side so thats really the most significant factor associated with the growth is in the mobile wallet side of it but even on the microcontroller side we see good strong growth in q as well and then actually have seen a little bit of pickup even in the audio side with some of the design wins that we have so its pretty much across the board stacy but the most significant contributing factor associated with it is the mobile wallet growth that will take place more on a seasonal basis than anything else as well as the success that were having in china on the transit basis stacy aaron rasgon  sanford c bernstein  co llc got it thank you thats helpful for my followup you bought back more stock in the quarter than i would have thought share count was down decently you bought back even more stock – or for q for going into q you bought back even more stock i just dont understand why is share count supposed to be flat in q why shouldnt it come down daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so thats just the standard policy the company has is with respect to guiding share count share count in the next quarter is going to be a function of timing of share repurchases in the prior quarter q as well as stock price dilution calculation and stock option exercising rather than trying to predict what the share price will be the number of options that get exercised its just a longstanding practice inside of the company to assume share count flat and then it will be what itll be based on those unknowable items next quarter stacy aaron rasgon  sanford c bernstein  co llc got it thank you thats helpful thank you guys richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks stacy daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks stacy operator thank you our next question comes from william stein of suntrust your line is now open william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thanks congratulations on the strong results and outlook im hoping you can give us some update in terms of the regulatory and operational timing effects with regard to the standard products sale richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director yeah i think will – i think we feel good about the progress were making on the regulatory basis on the standard products transaction and we talked about the – we actually put out a press release relative to the ftc side of that so i think we feel good about the progress on the regulatory side but the long pole in the tent as we talked about at the time of the announcement is actually being able to pull the it systems apart were in the process of combining the it systems of nxp and freescale and now at the same time trying to pull out standard products which is the most significant share of the actual quantity of units that we ship so thats really the thing that will be the gating factor relative to the close and we still anticipate being able to close in first quarter of  but its not going to be driven as much by the regulatory basis as it will be with our actual separation of the business william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc helpful if i can have one followup going back to automotive for a moment you spoke before about the success youre having in radar im wondering if the company might have any comment as to traction in vision and other adas solutions richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director so i guess the one thing that i must not have emphasized enough will on the call was that we had a very significant design win on vehicle to vehicle and we continue to be really the only company that has gotten the technology design wins in vehicle to vehicle that we believe will be a very fundamental element in a complete autonomous driving solution if you look at the auto industry theres really four levels of autonomous driving with only the last levels being fully autonomous if you actually get through level three which is a lot of safety features that assists the driving we get about  of the revenue associated with it the significant portions of that will be vehicle to vehicle will include radar and will include the processing associated with it we will be sure that we have the processing capability associated with the vision side but were not going to have the fundamental software logarithms and the capability that one of our competitors does to be able to focus on that from a vision side so we think that its really critical that you have all of the capability to make driving safer including the vehicle to vehicle and radar in addition to vision and potentially even lidar associated with it but the real key for us is being the leader in vehicle to vehicle the leader in radar and the leader in the processing that brings it all together for a safer driving experience and will drive a much more significant growth than just the inherent growth of the automotive market itself william stein  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks rick richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from toshiya hari of goldman sachs your line is now open toshiya hari  goldman sachs  co hey guys good morning and congrats on the solid quarter in your prepared remarks rick you talked a little bit about your traction with the automotive oems in japan and i was hoping you could elaborate on that comment which product groups are you seeing momentum in and what are some of the factors driving the success richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director yeah i think the key thing is really the beginning to ramp the shipments on mcu design wins that were won several years ago so that really represents a significant portion of the nearterm traction that we see with some of our key customers in japan in addition to that weve been now successful on the remote keyless entry so that we have kind of the last significant auto producer that we have the design win associated with as well although thats not such a significant nearterm revenue contributor so i think we continue to make good progress on the car infotainment side we basically supply virtually all of the major mid and highend car radios already making good progress on our apps processor on imx as well as the automotive microcontrollers toshiya hari  goldman sachs  co great thank you and my followup is on the inventory situation you talked a little bit about the channel and how its healthy but how would you characterize your own inventory level today daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so inventory on the balance sheet is  days its down  days sequentially and if you unpack the inventory change in the financials theres two components you get  million that gets reclassified as assets held for sale which will go with the standard products business on a dollar basis the other mover is a  million reduction on a dollar basis of our own inventory so were making great progress to our midterm target of about  days by dropping  days sequentially  to  toshiya hari  goldman sachs  co very helpful thank you so much richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from craig hettenbach of morgan stanley your line is now open craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc yes thank you just wanted to follow up on the comments of the vx at a top three oem just as you think about the pipeline of potential business and discussions that you have how thats progressing and how you see the market opportunity shaping up richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director well you know i think the really key thing on vx is the overall infrastructure requirements associated with it we also just participatedpartnered with the department of transportation on the smart city award where they announced this quarter columbus as the winner of the smart city award where theyll get around  million of funding from the us government and a related entity as well as theyve raised about  million locally so theyll have  million and one of the key things that theyre trying to do is be sure that they have as much safety added to driving municipal vehicles as possible so vx i think is something that will develop over the intermediate term its not going to be growing overnight the key for us is to win these significant design wins and this was one that was extremely significant that had been on the docket for some time and for some various reasons had gotten delayed and so were very pleased that we actually were the solution of choice for all of the bidders on this key business and as they won that it gave us a really solid position to be able to drive that over more of the intermediate term the key for us obviously is to be sure that we bring the security thats required to make driving or the automotive the car itself a secure and safe vehicle as well as having the connectivity to be able to improve the driving experience itself and weve chosen to use p as the standard associated with that because of the speed of transmission and the reduction of latency that makes it a much more safer communication vehicle than the other types of technology that are available craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc got it and then just as my followup on the comments on imx in terms of some of the momentum youre seeing can you talk about that opportunity set presently and as you go into next year richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director this is a business that jeff and the team have done a really good job of growing its grown at double digit really for the last couple years and we see the opportunity to continue to drive that growth based on the design wins they have were really – theyve done a great job of positioning it well on the car dashboard and cluster side and being able to bring that in with the rest of our automotive portfolio really puts us in a unique position to bring more of a complete solution to our customers so the traction we have a significant share of the traction is in the automotive side although they are making good progress in a number of different areas as well that are more on the general industrial side for future ramp ups over the intermediate term also craig m hettenbach  morgan stanley  co llc got it thank you richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from cj muse of evercore your line is now open cj muse  evercore isi yeah good morning thank you for taking my question i guess first question trying to understand seasonality going into q and i guess as part of that rick trying to juxtapose your comments in the prepared press release in terms of subdued macro environment and how we should think about progression for you guys as we go through the year end richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director so its interesting because this is a new experience for us as well because of the combination of the two companies it puts us in a different seasonal pattern than what weve been in in a historic base if you take the total business and look at it typically q would have been when you combine the two businesses would actually have been down where historically it would have been just slightly for an nxp viewpoint it gets a little bit more of a decline when we combine it with freescale we arent giving you guidance relative to q and what we would anticipate for q so i want to be very clear with that but relative to if you look at the last three years its the best effect that we have of equating seasonal pattern youd be down midsingle digit in q associated with it cj muse  evercore isi thats helpful and then i guess quick question for dan i know you dont want to put out operating margin targets or anything like that but looks like youve taken out about  million annualized opex great job there curious if it now gets harder if youre slicing maybe into a little bit more muscle than fat and if you can comment on whether the trajectory of costdown efforts may slow a little bit where youre focused anything you can share there would be very helpful thank you daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure so the targets we have out on an overall company basis post the divestiture of our standard products business is a  to  operating margin target and we expect to be in that range on a fullyear basis in  and exiting  within that range and so nothing about what weve seen to date causes us to come off of those longterm targets as we think about the nearterm footprints in the sand that walk us into that range and into those targets youll see big chunks of ground taken in q as evidenced by the results youll see a big chunk of ground taken in q as evidenced by the guide that  basis point progression in those two quarters get us a lot of momentum towards the synergy capture as you get closer to the target range clearly youll walk into that range a bit asymptotically and so youll see a bit more in the near term a bit less on a quarterly basis the rate of capture at the end second half of  and into  thats just the way these types of things progress if you look at what weve done when you compare it to q of  as a starting point q performance like you said suggests about  million of synergy capture from an opex standpoint on a annualized run rate basis in q the guide suggests close to  million on an annualized basis and so you can see an incremental ish million being captured into q so were still taking large chunks of ground again were focused were disciplined were driving execution to deliver the synergies and nothing changes our longterm perspective on those operating margin targets jeff palmer  vice presidentinvestor relations thanks cj operator thank you jeff palmer  vice presidentinvestor relations operator well take the next question operator our next question comes from chris caso of clsa your line is now open christopher caso  clsa americas llc yes thank you just a followup question on the secure id segment and i guess the question is how much of the business in that segment is single mode today and understand that youre choosing not to participate in that segment but how much could that be a drag on revenue going forward and therefore how close are we to the bottom in that business segment richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director well you kind of have to look at it by regional you cant really talk about it in total in china its all dual interface and if you look at rest of the world its virtually the majority very high percentage is contact today we are making some progress with some of the user experience to actually implement dual interface in the rest of the world but i think the key thing for us is you heard dan talk about our lack of growth expectations for the current quarter and that gives you our basis of what we believe the business is going to do the fundamental opportunity for us is to take that key capability the device security the hardware security and make that available to a broader array of applications so that we can be able to differentiate our solutions versus anybody else so while the business itself is – were going to continue to be very selective to ensure that we maintain the profitability requirements that we have while they may be different than our competitor in that market were going to be selective and so well see how that plays out over a period of time but we dont – were not laying out a significant growth opportunity in that business based on the environment we see from a competitive view point but again the fundamental core technology is the key element for us in being able to drive that for broader applications across the total company christopher caso  clsa americas llc okay as a followup question just if you could give some thoughts on potential for further ma just what your appetite would be at the moment once and i guess assuming that that would be the case once you hit your net debt to ebitda targets and what would be the criteria that youd be looking for if you did have that appetite richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director well the thing that weve been very specific about is is we want to ensure that we complete the integration completely before we really consider anything else i think the industry is definitely in a consolidating mode that we see its interesting to think about what alternatives there might be over the intermediate term we actually like our portfolio quite well when we get to the position that we feel comfortable with our debt level well look at the alternatives that really give us the best strategic position to be able to fill out our total applications associated with it so its clearly premature to talk about what areas that would be because our focus is really ensuring that we drive the integration of the complete business but our focus is on maximizing shareholder value and in whichever form that takes place that will be the key for us is how we can maximize shareholder value christopher caso  clsa americas llc thank you richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from ambrish srivastava of bank of montreal your line is now open ambrish srivastava  bmo capital markets united states hi thank you rick i just had one question back to the sis youve talked about the dynamics which seem to be not typical end markets or competitive environments we have been accustomed to seeing nxp operate in so i get the current quarter guide and this business with  billion business now is going to be lower than  million but longer term whats the right way to think about the growth trajectory for this segment i think youve laid out flat to low single digit longterm grower thank you richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director we did and so we dont anticipate significant growth in that itd be very low singledigit growth based on what we see in the current environment and that really depends on the competitive environment if it continues to be as unreasonable as it is where we have a competitor that doesnt have the same kind of profit expectations then well continue not to participate in some of that market because we dont want to take our profitability down we feel a responsibility to deliver a reasonable shareholder return for our investors and if our competition doesnt have that same requirement then well let them do that business and we wont participate in it ambrish srivastava  bmo capital markets united states okay so we should expect the same discipline that you have shown over the last several years thank you richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director absolutely operator thank you our next question comes from blayne curtis of barclays your line is now open blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for taking my question rick could you just talk about usb typec and your visibility into that ramp next year as a driver richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director yeah so blayne its interesting because it really fits in well with our highspeed interface portfolio when you think about the power side as well as the ability to move data at very rapid rate so we feel very good about the developments associated with it and the engagements we have with customers and the technical solutions that we can offer it obviously has more work to be done were not delivering a lot of revenue today but we would anticipate that this is a significant opportunity for us next year to be able to continue to maintain our leadership in the highspeed interface area including typec jeff palmer  vice presidentinvestor relations yeah and blayne remember from our analyst day that we guided the secure interface  infrastructure group to be up mid to high single digits on a threeyear cagr basis so were not moving off of that view and usb typec would be one of those tailwinds that provides some growth there blayne curtis  barclays capital inc thanks and i just want to circle back on a prior radar question can you just talk about – obviously its far out but when it does happen can you just talk about the number of radars as youre starting to see some early interest in even wins per cars the content per car i know its ranged quite a lot when you do see the initial revenue will it be just one or are you going to see multiple units per car richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director theres no question well see multiple units in most of the architecture thats provided associated with it whether thats one to three which is kind of in the level one implementation where its really low level driver assistance or level three which is right at the edge of autonomous driving is making driving as safe as possible which would have about three to six radars per vehicle or completely autonomous driving which could have up to  radar sensors per vehicle so if you look at the value per vehicle thats anywhere from  to  on the level one implementation to be up to  to  on the level three implementation and  to  on the full autonomous driving solution so thats the reason were so focused on ensuring that we have a disproportionate market share and a true leadership position in radar as this develops and can be able to maintain that overall key contributing factor to providing safer driving jeff palmer  vice presidentinvestor relations and maybe if i could just add rick if you remember back on our analyst day blayne kurt and bob conrad both also highlighted their view of adas as a percentage of overall automotive revenue over the next couple of years and we said that by  we think adas products can make up to  of our overall automotive revenue clearly its going to be an area of very fast growth inside of that organization blayne curtis  barclays capital inc thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from matt ramsay of canaccord genuity your line is now open matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc thank you very much good morning i wanted to ask another question i think a longer term one on the automotive business it occurs to me that many folks are maybe a bit more focused on the inferencing processor or the application processor in future autonomous driving deployment and one of the things thats impressed me about the nxp bluebox platform is both being integrated but also separating the different functions particularly savings  maybe rick you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics in that key application processor versus some other areas there that you guys might have less competition and more differentiation and then second how is the bluebox platform designed to integrate processors from maybe other vendors that might have share in that one socket thanks richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director so thanks the bluebox for us is an integrated solution to really bring our complete computing horsepower to be able to provide a platform for our automotive customers to really be able to do the work thats required to improve their autonomous driving experience well take that fundamental capability and obviously as they get to volume production they will tailor that and well have a more focused processing to be able to meet the requirements associated with it the real advantage for us on the bluebox is being able to engage with the car companies themselves show them the fundamental capability and work with them on driving the autonomous driving experience and continue to provide the computing leadership position that we do today across the overall car were not in a position where we want to be focused on big gpu artificial intelligence processing thats not our niche thats not what were going to really provide capability we want to be focused on the highvolume computing thats really in support of allowing safer driving artificial intelligence systems are not what were focused on and not where were putting our investment associated with it and theyre a long ways away from being able to be implemented in a car today provided or implemented in production today operator thank you and our last question will come from tore svanberg of stifel your line is now open tore svanberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes thank you dan i was hoping youd elaborate a little bit more on the debt that you just announced last night the  million looks like you only need about  million here initially so just wondering why you raised as much as you did especially considering youll get some cash from the standard product sale here relatively soon daniel durn  chief financial officer  executive vice president so its opportunistically taking advantage of the debt markets doing a tag on offering to an existing tranche thats out there youre right theres  million maturity in the near term but as you think about keeping that cash on the balance sheet and general corporate purposes and how were focused on managing equity versus debt the company is going to take a balanced approach and so it was just taking advantage of an attractive market opportunity and then being smart about how we manage the balance sheet going forward knowing what we know is going to happen in q tore svanberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc great and my followup is for rick rick as related to the rf power business you talk about some delays and pushouts in base station wins so i was just hoping if you could elaborate a little bit on that if this is a very shortterm delay or is this little bit more extensive than that richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director you tell me i mean the rf power business is one that we have tire tracks on our back from trying to misjudge we had heard feedback from our customers that there were some opportunities in china and india relative to the implementation of nextgeneration base stations it looks like those have been pushed out some based on budgetary constraints or implementations and so weve seen a slowing thats actually taken place associated with that so we clearly dont have visibility beyond basically the next quarter in that business the bottom line is its a nice profitable business but the ability to predict the growth associated with that business is nonexistent and the truth is our customers have the same issue with their base station customers so its not like theyre doing something unique to make it worse its just a bad supply chain and hard to predict but the bottom line is it does drive a nice profitability we have a true leadership position and we want to be sure that we can continue to maintain that we are focused on diversifying it into other areas beyond base stations and making progress in that but its still relatively small share of the total revenue tore svanberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc thats helpful thank you guys richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thanks tore operator thank you and at this time i would like to turn the call over to mr rick clemmer for any closing remarks richard l clemmer  president chief executive officer  executive director thank you very much operator thank you for joining us today obviously we want to ensure that we continue to focus on realizing the full potential of our combination with the good progress that weve achieved to date but still a lot more work to do as we focus on maximizing shareholder value resulting from the combination thank you very
