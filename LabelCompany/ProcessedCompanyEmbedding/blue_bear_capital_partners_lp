llc introduction — bear capital partners bear capital partners bear capital partners bcp was formed to meet the current needs of the multifamily real estate market  ronald l meer was appointed president because his guidance and leadership has previously led to significant value appreciation for his investors as a result of       successful rehabs of tired or poorly functioning properties       repositioning of inadequately or incorrectly marketed properties       acquisition of properties which represented excellent prospects for value creation and       new constructiondevelopment opportunities utilizing proven unique product designs in markets with pent up demand for new multifamily propertiesbcp’s motto is best expressed through the following formula ron meer has been successful because he believes in the ever ending need for strong multifamily assets in the portfolio of his investors  throughout his career ron has served his investors well by applying the aforementioned formula for success hard work and the ability to put strong work teams together in design marketing property management construction and finance such teams represent a blend of inside employees outside contracted professionals and talented subcontractorsvendors  moreover his teams are always anchored with strong marketing exceptional operational and strategically focused staff who think ‘outside the box’there is one thing that is a certainty about investing in real estate” according to ron  “when you look at the increases in population in the united states due to a higher birth rate than the current death rate the influx of new citizens from immigration and because of a very difficult sfh lender environment there is a ton of pent up demand the demand for multifamily product by consumers will not be satisfied for years to come and this is acutely true in markets where there is job creation or job migration taking place”  as the population changes to follow the job migration to look for lower priced housing or to seek a lifestyle away from the social problems we will be there to meet the need for new housing opportunities for potential residentswhile there was significant overbuilding of retail and single family residential properties in  through  and again perhaps in  and  multifamily real estate remains at historically high occupancies  moreover many rental opportunities which heretofore had not been seen in the marketplace revealed themselves during the past two years due to the large addition changes made by portfolio owners and in certain markets special servicers most of this inventory has been foreclosed and resold in most markets   as families displaced by the foreclosure process and the difficulty of new loan qualification look for housing apartment rental properties have become their short term focus to house their families  multifamily apartment communities where there are superior amenities and facilities to support their families have become their preferred and the most commonly accepted solution to their housing displacement source us census bureau the indicators for apartment homes are dramatic with the trends showing huge decreases in vacancies through  even with of record amounts of new product coming online in  and                                                                             source  marcus  millichap research the obvious trend in  through  cannot be ignored and this trend appears to be poised to repeat itself in  through   housing starts for apartment homes are surging yet there just isnt enough new product coming online to meet the demand for new housing just from the birth rate and foreclosure issues alonewhether you are a multifamily property owner investor or vendor looking to find a successful team to work with in providing the products provided by our company bear capital

fool foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search enterprise products partners lp the bear case from a bull a look at some of the risks that bullish investors should keep in mind matthew dilallo tmfmd jul   at am its no secret that i believe enterprise products partners nyseepd is an excellent company to own for the long term fueling that bullishness is the fact that the pipeline giant has a rocksolid business model and visible growth prospects on the horizon thanks to the  billion of capital projects it has lined up these factors should enable the company to continue to grow its distribution to investors  that said just because im bullish on the company doesnt mean i dont pay attention to bearish arguments quite the opposite in fact since i have a growing portion of my net worth invested in the company which is at risk if bears are right thats why i think its a good idea to review their case so that investors know full well the risks involved when investing in enterprise products partners image source getty images its access to cheap capital might dry up enterprise products partners is one of the most fiscally conservative master limited partnerships mlps in the sector by keeping its leverage ratio around  times or less the company has earned one of the highest credit ratings among mlps furthermore it also maintains a large margin of safety on its distribution averaging more than  times coverage last year allowing it to retain  million of cash flow to finance growth projects because of that strong financial profile it has never had any issues accessing the money it needs to fund expansion that said the company typically needs to raise a boatload of outside capital to finance these projects last year for example it spent nearly  billion on capex since it only generated  million in excess cash for the year it needed to issue roughly  billion of debt and equity to bridge the gap while it didnt have any trouble raising that money last year a deep credit market crisis in the future could make it hard for enterprise to obtain the cash it needs to finance growth projects at acceptable rates that was the case for several of its rivals during the recent oil market downturn for example oneoks nyseoke former mlp needed to secure  billion in bank financing early last year so it could refinance an upcoming bond maturity after longerterm funding options became prohibitively expensive oneoks affiliate expected that the move would eliminate its need to access the public debt and equity markets until well into  which bought it time while it waited for the capital markets to open back up while enterprise products partners avoided a similar fate last year it did issue twice as much equity to finance growth projects as it usually does to keep its leverage metrics low which shows that its not completely immune to market dislocations image source getty images opposition to new pipeline projects intensifies enterprise products partners has a long history of completing its growth projects on time and on budget thats one reason why the company has been able to increase its distribution to investors in each of the last  quarters meanwhile with  billion of capital projects under construction enterprise products partners should be able to keep that streak going for at least the next few years that said enterprise has been one of the lucky ones since it hasnt run into any major issues completing new projects rivals energy transfer partners nyseetp and williams partners nysewpz on the other hand have run into several unforeseen issues in recent years that have delayed major expansion projects in energy transfer partners case it encountered opposition that tried to block its attempts to finish the  billion bakken pipeline system which ended up delaying its inservice date by more than six months costing it millions in added expenses and cash flow meanwhile williams partners experienced a delay in receiving approval for its  billion atlantic sunrise project and was denied a permit for its nearly  billion constitution pipeline due to opposition to those projects given the increasing worries about climate change opposition to new oil and gas projects will likely continue rising in the years ahead that could eventually impact enterprise products partners growth plans by either causing a lengthy delay of a critical project or even forcing the company to cancel a project due to issues receiving permits a string of costly delays or project cancellations could end up halting the companys distribution growth streak  investor takeaway bulls like me love enterprise products partners ability to leverage its vast portfolio of feebased assets and deliver steady income growth over the long term that said for the company to continue growing it needs access to cheap capital and the ability to move forward with its expansion projects without facing any significant delays or unforeseen expenses given the issues its peers have had in the recent past these arent risks that bulls should take lightly however because the company is more conservative than most rivals it does have a greater cushion to withstand a setback thats why i remain confident that it can continue to grow at a healthy rate for years to come  matt dilallo owns shares of enterprise products partners the motley fool owns shares of and recommends oneok the motley fool recommends enterprise products partners the motley
