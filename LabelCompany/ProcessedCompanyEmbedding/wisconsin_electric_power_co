court of wisconsin argued january   decided february    for the appellants there was a brief and oral argument by scott v lowry of waukesha  for the respondent there was a brief by william p croke and prosser wiedabach  quale sc of milwaukee and oral argument by mr croke beilfuss c j in  the plaintiffsappellants ralph and dorothy ransome owned a twofamily rental house in the town of waukesha waukesha county the defendantrespondent wisconsin electric power company furnished the electricity used in the house the electricity supplied by the defendant was the customary residential voltage of  the electricity was transmitted over the defendants lines to a pole located near the plaintiffs house and then through a transformer attached to the pole in normal operations the voltage is reduced at this transformer from  volts to  volts the electricity at this reduced voltage goes over a line to the electric meter located at the house and after the electricity is metered it goes into the electrical system of the house all of the transmission lines and equipment up to and including the meter are owned by and supervised by the defendant electric company the evidence established that approximately four days before september th lightning struck the transmission line near the transformer on september th the pole transformer exploded allowing xxxxxxxx volts of electricity to pass through the meter and into plaintiffs house this overload of electricity was the cause of the fire and resulting damage the plaintiffs commenced this products liability action contending that at the time the electricity left the defendant companys control it was unreasonably dangerous the defendant denied the electricity was unreasonably dangerous when it left its control and affirmatively alleged that a lightning strike was an act of god and a superseding intervening cause of the fire damage by way of argument the defendant contends that it should  be relieved of any liability because of policy considerations the following historical facts appear in the record approximately  distribution transformers of the type which figured in the incident at issue here are located within the wisconsin electric power companys present system to the best of defendants knowledge there have been no other cases where a fire or other damage has occurred to a residence as a result of the failure or malfunction of a residential line distribution transformer the last date prior to september   on which the wire and equipment of pole  were inspected was december   ordinarily electricity leaves the control of the wisconsin electric power company at the point in the distribution system where a customers conductors are connected to the companys conductors namely at the electric meter the electric meter installed at the electricity service entrance of a residence belongs to the wisconsin electric power company which is responsible for its maintenance and repair the sale of electricity takes place at the meter where charges are generally computed   while there probably are numerous technical definitions of electricity we need not be concerned with those accurate descriptions heresuffice it to say it is a form of energy that can be made or produced by men confined controlled transmitted and distributed to be used as an energy source for heat power and light and is distributed in the stream of commerce the distribution might well be a service but the electricity itself in the contemplation of the ordinary user is a consumable product  expert witnesses testified concerning the probable sequence of events at the utility pole in question and at the electricity service entrance to the house at the time of and just prior to the fire dr george steber professor of electrical engineering and consultant for many companies in the milwaukee area regarding high voltage design appeared for the plaintiffs mr james mccowen superintendent of the distribution operation division of the wisconsin electric power company and john karlman troubleman for the company testified for the defendant dr steber explained that the method of transmitting electricity over long distance at high voltage and reducing it by means of a transformer before it entered a residence was an economical and convenient way of distributing electricity in wisconsin it is the primary mode of transmission of electricity furthermore the pole transformer used to reduce the line voltage from  volts to  volts was a standard utility installation used throughout wisconsin and was certainly within all accepted engineering practices the witnesses gave an explanation of the functioning of the pole transformer a summary of which is as follows the electrical power right outside the main generating plant is stepped up either to  or  volts this is later stepped down to  or  volts and finally to  volts after the electricity has been distributed to the appropriate substations electricity is transmitted along the primary lines at  volts until it reaches a stepdown transformer where it is reduced to  volts it then passes over the secondary lines and is distributed to individual buildings a primary fuse is inserted in series with the high voltage wire that is connected to the transformer for the purpose of protecting the line two primary connections leading from the upper crossarm of the pole to the transformer provide the power into the transformer  three conductors coming out provide the  volt service to the house the inside of the transformer is basically a steel or iron core with several sets of copper wires wrapped around electricity going through the coil will transform from the  volts going in to  volts coming out the wires wound on the core are physically insulated from the tank and from the secondary conductors by means of an oil insulation the installation is also equipment with a lightning arrester installed to drain to ground as quickly as possible most of the excess energywhich may be in the vicinity of hundreds of thousands of voltsproduced by a lightning strike the above description describes the general engineering design of the installation however it does not reflect the actual condition of the components prior to the accident john karlman the troubleman dispatched to the scene on the night of the fire examined the pole transformer his summary of the probable condition of the components prior to the fire was not contested the electrical insulator on the top of the cross bar was missing the primary fuse was broken part was lying on the cross bar in several pieces part was hanging down below the primary crossarm with the damage to the insulator the primary wire was free and resting directly on the cross bar mccowen testified that in itself it is not harmful as long as the surface of the crossarm remains dry since woodwhen dryis a relatively good insulator in addition the lightning arrester was spent it was found broken in at least two pieces with the ends dangling thus the device was incapable of interrupting any additional lightning surges based on the condition in which mr karlman found the equipment on the utility pole on the loud noise heard during the rain storm four days earlier in the area of the utility pole and on the simultaneous momentary power outage which occurred in both the ransomes and  neighboring house mr mccowen was able to conclude that the damage done to the lightning arrester the insulator and the primary fuse was probably the result of a lightning strike several days before the fire mr mccowen testified that it is not frequent but neither is it uncommon to have porcelain insulators damaged by a relatively close lightning strike when this happens the porcelain will crack due to the intense heat and either fall to the ground immediately or some time later due to the action of the wind vibrating the wires dr steber agreed that the insulator pin could have been damaged by lightning however he noted that in fact these devices can be broken and removed for a variety of reasons for example someone shooting at it with a rifle with the above summary of the general design of the pole transformer and the actual condition of the installation in question as a foundation we consider the immediate circumstances of the fire it was raining heavily on the night of september   as mentioned above the electrical insulator on the top of the cross bar of the utility pole was missing the fuse was broken in several pieces and the primary wire with a current of  volts was resting on the wooden cross bar mr mccowen gave the following testimony substantially corroborated by dr steber concerning the probable sequence of events at this point    when the rain started on the date of the accident the cross arm would have become damp its also contaminated with dirt and the like at this point in time the electrical energy in the primary wire probably started to arc from that wire to ground   when its trying to get to ground the nearest ground point it can find is a ground wire which is stapled underneath  this cross arm to connect the bottom part of the lightning arrester to the ground wire which goes down the pole a distance of perhaps three inches maybe four inches until it can find enough of a conducting path through the damp and wet cross arm nothing will happen as soon as the conducting path becomes energized the electricity will start to arc over the surface of the cross arm   at the point where the primary fuse cut out and fell in two    at that point in time the service to the transformer has been disconnected normal power flow is interrupted    with the normal service to the transformer interrupted by the fact that the fuse cutout has broken entirely in two and disconnected it with the arcing continuing from the primary wire across the cross arm it appears that the primarythe circuit was established between the primary wire and the case of the transformer   the primary power getting into the outside of the case of the transformer broke down the insulation between the transformer tank and the secondary windings of the transformer they probably had been damaged by the lightning surge which took place several days before   when the insulation breaks down to a sufficient point the fortyeight hundred volts would arc from the transformer tank through the insulating medium including the insulating oil to the secondary coil of the transformer and in doing this it would cause a violent burning at the same time the primary voltage rather than being transformed from fortyeight hundred volts to a hundred and twenty volts would be going directly into the secondary leads and through the secondary conductors in the service drop into the home at the same time this arcing is occurring under the oil the energy is very very high the oil would bubble it would burn it would generate tremendous amounts of gas and in a very short period of time probably in a matter of seconds would blow the cover off the transformer and the cover was blown off the transformer in this case after the explosion mccowen further testified the secondary bushings were blown out and fused together  consequently an electrical path formed from the  volt sideor the primary sideto the secondary side which led directly to the house the house was protected by circuit breakers or fuses however electrical service entrances to residences have a maximum voltage rating of  volts as the expert testimony revealed applying a voltage in excess of the voltage rating of the fuses andor circuit breakers for the home circumvents their function the circuit breakers in the house were consequently of very little value under the circumstances with respect to the actual cause of the fire it was mr mccowens professional opinion that the high voltage which through a unique set of circumstances entered the plaintiffs premises caused the incident he further testified that a system which would be able to prevent the type of accident would be too expensive in terms of personnel and unacceptable in terms of the time customers would be required to stay without power pending reconnection dr steber gave his expert opinion that the high voltage of between xxxxxxxx volts was unreasonably dangerous as applied to a residential home while he could not say definitely that it did in fact cause the fire he did say that there was enough voltage and enough current to cause it however dr steber took issue with the position of the defendant that the voltage that reached the house was not actually supplied by the company declaringobviously the electricity came from the wisconsin electric power company the first assistant chief of the waukesha fire department at the time of the fire testified that his investigation of the remains of the building indicated that the fire was caused by an overload of electricity in the service entrance of the home at the close of the testimony the defendant electric company moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that the evidence demonstrated that the  volt electricity  escaped from the control of the wisconsin electric power company before it could be placed in the stream of commerce the court reserved ruling on the motion until after the verdict a special verdict with the following three questions was submitted to the jury on september   question no  was the electricity when it left the possession of the wisconsin electric power company in such defective condition as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective consumer question no  if you answer question no  yes then answer this question was such defective condition a cause of damage to the plaintiffs house question no  what sum of money will reasonably compensate the plaintiffs for the damage to their house after three hours deliberation the jury returned the verdict with an answer of no to the first question and  to the third plaintiffs motion for a change in the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied the issues as we see them are as follows  does the doctrine of strict liability in tort as defined in dippel v sciano  wis d   nwd   apply to electricity  did the trial court err in refusing to set aside the jurys answer to question no  of the special verdict that the electricity when it left the possession of the wisconsin electric power company was in such defective condition as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective consumer  should public policy considerations preclude the imposition of strict liability under the facts of this case this is a products liability action and is founded upon sec a restatement  torts d pp  as adopted and modified by this court in dippel v sciano supra  wisd at  the section reads as follows  sec a special liability of seller of product for physical harm to user or consumer  one who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer or to his property if a the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product and b it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold  the rule stated in subsection  applies although a the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product and b the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller  the courts modification of this rule in dippel was intended merely to accommodate wisconsins system of tort liability which includes the principle of comparative negligence under which the plaintiff is subject to a diminution of his damages in the event that and to the extent that he contributed to the injuries   strict liability does not make the manufacturer or seller an insurer nor does it impose absolute liability it is not enough for the plaintiff merely to show that he was using the product and he was injured in the language of dippel at  the plaintiff must prove  that the product was in defective condition when it left the possession or  control of the seller  that it was unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer  that the defect was a cause a substantial factor of the plaintiffs injuries or damages  that the seller engaged in the business of selling such product or put negatively that this is not an isolated or infrequent transaction not related to the principal business of the seller and  that the product was one which the seller expected to and did reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition it was when he sold it furthermore certain defenses are available to the manufacturer or seller contributory negligence misuse abuse or alteration of the product inherent or unavoidable danger natural wear assumption of risk id this court in dippel at  summarized the solid public policy considerations which underlie the rule the reason which has been reiterated most often is that the seller is in the paramount position to distribute the costs of the risks created by the defective product he is selling he may pass the cost on to the consumer via increased prices he may protect himself either by purchasing insurance or by a form of selfinsurance in justification of making the seller pay for the risk it is argued that the consumer or user has the right to rely on the apparent safety of the product and that it is the seller in the first instance who creates the risk by placing the defective product on the market a correlative consideration where the manufacturer is concerned is that the manufacturer has the greatest ability to control the risk created by his product since he may initiate or adopt inspection and quality control measures thereby preventing defective products from reaching the consumer comment c of sec a restatement  torts d at  provides this analysis of the policy basis for the rule    the seller by marketing his product for use and consumption has undertaken and assumed a special responsibility toward any member of the consuming  public who may be injured by it    public policy demands that the burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for consumption be placed upon those who market them and be treated as a cost of production against which liability insurance can be obtained and that the consumer of such products is entitled to the maximum of protection at the hands of someone and the proper persons to afford it are those who market the products these social policy justifications must be kept in mind in applying the strict liability rules set forth above to the facts of the present case the defendant electric power company makes the argument that as a general matter the rule of strict liability in tort is inapplicable to the sale of electricity the company bases this contention on its view that electricity is not a product and on this courts holding in kemp v wisconsin electric power co  wis d   nwd   we believe the companys understanding of the scope of the term product is mistaken and its reliance on kemp is misplaced kemp involved an action for damages for injuries sustained when the child plaintiff contacted the electric power company line while controlling a gasoline powered model airplane significantly the court held that strict liability as defined in dippel supra  wis d at  had no application to the facts of the case since the electricity which injured daniel kemp had not been sold but was still in the control of the defendant the reasoning of the court in disposing of the strict liability issue is in fact authority for the proposition that wisconsin had implicitly adopted the view that electricity is a product subject to the rule of strict liability in the appropriate case logically the courts citation of the words of oesterreich v claas  wis    nw   that    the liability is nevertheless grounded upon negligence and is not the liability of  an insurer   must be understood to refer to situations where the electricity has not yet been sold and strict liability concepts cannot come into play in kemp the injured party was neither a purchaser nor a user here the plaintiffs were both to classify electricity as a product by virtue of the definition we have set forth above is warranted indeed mandated by the social policies which underlie and justify the imposition of strict liability on sellers who place dangerously defective products into the stream of commerce  we agree with the trial courts conclusion that electricity can be a product within the meaning of sec a and therefore subject to principles of strict liability in tort in appropriate cases the sole fact that the rule of strict liability in tort can be applied to the sale of electricity is insufficient to impose liability on the electric company in the present case plaintiffs were obliged to prove that the electricity when it left the possession of the electric company was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or his property   in vincer v esther wms allalum s pool co  wis d    nwd   this court cited and applied the following restatement definitions for defective condition and unreasonably dangerous comment g to sec a of restatement  torts d defines defective condition in part as follows g defective condition the rule stated in this section applies only where the product is at the time it leaves the sellers hands in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer which will be unreasonably dangerous to him    comment i to sec a of the restatement defines unreasonably dangerous in part as follows  i unreasonably dangerous the rule stated in this section applies only where the defective condition of the product makes it unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer many products cannot possibly be made entirely safe for all consumption and any food or drug necessarily involves some risk of harm if only from overconsumption ordinary sugar is a deadly poison to diabetics and castor oil found use under mussolini as an instrument of torture that is not what is meant by unreasonably dangerous in this section the article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics emphasis supplied  the court id at p  elaborated further on the applicable standard thus the test in wisconsin of whether a product contains an unreasonably dangerous defect depends upon the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer concerning the characteristics of this type of product if the average consumer would reasonably anticipate the dangerous condition of the product and fully appreciate the attendant risk of injury it would not be unreasonably dangerous and defective this is an objective test and is not dependent upon the knowledge of the particular injured consumer     despite the formulation of this general test this court has held that defect is not susceptible of any general definition and can only be defined on a casebycase basis jagmin v simonds abrasive co  wis d    nwd   see also annot   alr d   sec  b turning again to the facts of this case we begin with the proposition that strict liability may be imposed on the electric company only if the electricity when it left the sellers hands was in a condition not contemplated  by the ultimate consumer and unreasonably dangerous to him ie dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer with regard to this issue the trial court instructed the jury in relevant part as follows a product is said to be defective when it is not reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which such product was sold and intended to be used and the defect arose out of the design manufacture or inspection while the article was in control of the seller a defective product is unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer when it is dangerous to an extent beyond which would be contemplated by the ordinary user or consumer possessing the knowledge of the products characteristics which were common to the community cf  wis j icivil part ii  the electricity which passed through the electric meter controlled by the defendant electric power company and into the plaintiffs house had a voltage between  and  volts it was undisputed that  volts was the voltage normally distributed to residental consumers and was the voltage the plaintiffs had actually purchased for their house the evidence was also clear and uncontroverted that such high voltage was unreasonably dangerous for use in a residental home and did in fact cause the fire which occurred on september   while  volt electricity may be safe and suitable for some purposes it is clear from the evidence in this case that such voltage as applied to an ordinary private residence is defective and unreasonably dangerous within the meaning of the products liability doctrine as adopted in wisconsin indicative of the fact that the possibility of such an excessively high electrical overload rendered the electricity dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchased it is the fact that ordinary  homes are protected by circuit breakers or fuses with a maximum voltage rating of only  volts  review of the evidence in the present case reveals that the testimony and evidence is insufficient to sustain the jury verdict we believe the credible evidence in this case unequivocally leads to but one findingthe electricity when it left the possession of the wisconsin electric power company was in such defective condition as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective customer it follows that the trial court should have granted the motion to change the answer of question no  from no to yes  the electric company contends that the jury verdict can also be sustained on the ground that the electricity left the companys possession before passing through the electricity service entrance and into the plaintiffs house the company bases this argument on the testimony of mr mccowen that at some point in the sequence of events leading up to the fire the  volt electricity in the primary wires arced across the surface of the crossarm to the transformer case thus triggering the events which culminated in the explosion of the transformer the fusing together of the secondary bushings and finally the passage of the  volt electricity to the secondary wires leading to the plaintiffs house we do not believe this argument is meritorious the  volt electricity was in the control of wisconsin electric power company as it passedhowever it passedalong the primary wires through the transformer over the secondary wires and up to the electric meter owned and controlled by the defendant company it did not leave the defendants possession until it passed through the electric meter the point at which the sale is made and into the customers house given the characteristics of  electricity any other conclusion would unreasonably insulate a power company from liabilityeven under a negligence theory  the respondent also asserted the defense that an act of god ie lightning was an intervening superseding cause of the fire this court has never specifically declared that this defense is available in a products liability action dippel supra  wis d  makes it clear that the plaintiff is required to prove causation ie that the defect in the product was a cause substantial factor of the plaintiffs injuries or damages it would seem logical therefore that an act of god defenseas it affects causationmight be available in some limited circumstances it is questionable however whether lightning striking a utility pole could or should come within the act of god doctrine under the circumstances of the present case lightning strikes are a fairly frequent foreseeable and recurring problem for one engaged in the generation and distribution of electricity indeed electric power lines and utility pole installations are equipped with special safety devices to minimize the consequences of just such occurrences the defense therefore should not be available to the electric company to relieve it of strict liability for its defective and unreasonably dangerous product in this case many years ago in jackson v wisconsin telephone co  wis    nw   this court said the further argument is made that the stroke of lightning was the act of god for which no one is responsible certainly a stroke of lightning is an act of god but that is not the question here presented or rather another elementie the negligence of manis added to the question which materially alters its scope if i owning a high mast or building which i know is so situated as to be likely to be struck by lightning construct an attractive path for the lightning to my neighbors  roof so that his house is destroyed by a bolt which strikes my mast or building shall i escape liability for my negligent or wrongful act by pleading that the lightning was the act of god certainly not i invited the stroke of one of the most destructive powers of nature and negligently turned its course to my neighbors property the principle is the same as that involved in the case of borchardt v wausau boom co  wis  the lightning stroke is in no greater degree the act of god than the usual freshets occurring in a river the defendantrespondent also argues that public policy factors should preclude the imposition of liability in this case  the relevant public policy considerations weigh heavily in favor of the consumer in the present case consumer selfprotection from the defective and unreasonably dangerous product namely electricity of an excessively high voltage is not feasible in the case of the ordinary consumer abstention from use of the product is unrealistic electric power supplied by a sole electric company is generally the sole source of electricity in addition the seller here is in a better position to anticipate protect against and eliminate possible dangerous electricity overloads of this type finally the seller can more easily absorb or spread or insure against any financial losses which result public policy considerations do not preclude the imposition of liability in this case we therefore conclude that the trial court should have granted the plaintiffs motion to change the answers to questions  and  of the verdict to yes and the motion  for judgment notwithstanding the verdict judgment should be for the plaintiffs by the court judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion notes  motion for reconsideration denied with  costs on may    arching is the ability of electricity to jump from one point to another it is the passage of electricity through the air not along or through a conductor  dippel v sciano supra  wisd at  barter v general motors corp  wis d    nwd    dippel v sciano supra  wisd at  howes v deere  company  wis

power company defendantrespondent no  supreme court of wisconsin argued january   decided february    for the appellants there was a brief and oral argument by scott v lowry of waukesha  for the respondent there was a brief by william p croke and prosser wiedabach  quale sc of milwaukee and oral argument by mr croke beilfuss c j in  the plaintiffsappellants ralph and dorothy ransome owned a twofamily rental house in the town of waukesha waukesha county the defendantrespondent wisconsin electric power company furnished the electricity used in the house the electricity supplied by the defendant was the customary residential voltage of  the electricity was transmitted over the defendants lines to a pole located near the plaintiffs house and then through a transformer attached to the pole in normal operations the voltage is reduced at this transformer from  volts to  volts the electricity at this reduced voltage goes over a line to the electric meter located at the house and after the electricity is metered it goes into the electrical system of the house all of the transmission lines and equipment up to and including the meter are owned by and supervised by the defendant electric company the evidence established that approximately four days before september th lightning struck the transmission line near the transformer on september th the pole transformer exploded allowing xxxxxxxx volts of electricity to pass through the meter and into plaintiffs house this overload of electricity was the cause of the fire and resulting damage the plaintiffs commenced this products liability action contending that at the time the electricity left the defendant companys control it was unreasonably dangerous the defendant denied the electricity was unreasonably dangerous when it left its control and affirmatively alleged that a lightning strike was an act of god and a superseding intervening cause of the fire damage by way of argument the defendant contends that it should  be relieved of any liability because of policy considerations the following historical facts appear in the record approximately  distribution transformers of the type which figured in the incident at issue here are located within the wisconsin electric power companys present system to the best of defendants knowledge there have been no other cases where a fire or other damage has occurred to a residence as a result of the failure or malfunction of a residential line distribution transformer the last date prior to september   on which the wire and equipment of pole  were inspected was december   ordinarily electricity leaves the control of the wisconsin electric power company at the point in the distribution system where a customers conductors are connected to the companys conductors namely at the electric meter the electric meter installed at the electricity service entrance of a residence belongs to the wisconsin electric power company which is responsible for its maintenance and repair the sale of electricity takes place at the meter where charges are generally computed   while there probably are numerous technical definitions of electricity we need not be concerned with those accurate descriptions heresuffice it to say it is a form of energy that can be made or produced by men confined controlled transmitted and distributed to be used as an energy source for heat power and light and is distributed in the stream of commerce the distribution might well be a service but the electricity itself in the contemplation of the ordinary user is a consumable product  expert witnesses testified concerning the probable sequence of events at the utility pole in question and at the electricity service entrance to the house at the time of and just prior to the fire dr george steber professor of electrical engineering and consultant for many companies in the milwaukee area regarding high voltage design appeared for the plaintiffs mr james mccowen superintendent of the distribution operation division of the wisconsin electric power company and john karlman troubleman for the company testified for the defendant dr steber explained that the method of transmitting electricity over long distance at high voltage and reducing it by means of a transformer before it entered a residence was an economical and convenient way of distributing electricity in wisconsin it is the primary mode of transmission of electricity furthermore the pole transformer used to reduce the line voltage from  volts to  volts was a standard utility installation used throughout wisconsin and was certainly within all accepted engineering practices the witnesses gave an explanation of the functioning of the pole transformer a summary of which is as follows the electrical power right outside the main generating plant is stepped up either to  or  volts this is later stepped down to  or  volts and finally to  volts after the electricity has been distributed to the appropriate substations electricity is transmitted along the primary lines at  volts until it reaches a stepdown transformer where it is reduced to  volts it then passes over the secondary lines and is distributed to individual buildings a primary fuse is inserted in series with the high voltage wire that is connected to the transformer for the purpose of protecting the line two primary connections leading from the upper crossarm of the pole to the transformer provide the power into the transformer  three conductors coming out provide the  volt service to the house the inside of the transformer is basically a steel or iron core with several sets of copper wires wrapped around electricity going through the coil will transform from the  volts going in to  volts coming out the wires wound on the core are physically insulated from the tank and from the secondary conductors by means of an oil insulation the installation is also equipment with a lightning arrester installed to drain to ground as quickly as possible most of the excess energywhich may be in the vicinity of hundreds of thousands of voltsproduced by a lightning strike the above description describes the general engineering design of the installation however it does not reflect the actual condition of the components prior to the accident john karlman the troubleman dispatched to the scene on the night of the fire examined the pole transformer his summary of the probable condition of the components prior to the fire was not contested the electrical insulator on the top of the cross bar was missing the primary fuse was broken part was lying on the cross bar in several pieces part was hanging down below the primary crossarm with the damage to the insulator the primary wire was free and resting directly on the cross bar mccowen testified that in itself it is not harmful as long as the surface of the crossarm remains dry since woodwhen dryis a relatively good insulator in addition the lightning arrester was spent it was found broken in at least two pieces with the ends dangling thus the device was incapable of interrupting any additional lightning surges based on the condition in which mr karlman found the equipment on the utility pole on the loud noise heard during the rain storm four days earlier in the area of the utility pole and on the simultaneous momentary power outage which occurred in both the ransomes and  neighboring house mr mccowen was able to conclude that the damage done to the lightning arrester the insulator and the primary fuse was probably the result of a lightning strike several days before the fire mr mccowen testified that it is not frequent but neither is it uncommon to have porcelain insulators damaged by a relatively close lightning strike when this happens the porcelain will crack due to the intense heat and either fall to the ground immediately or some time later due to the action of the wind vibrating the wires dr steber agreed that the insulator pin could have been damaged by lightning however he noted that in fact these devices can be broken and removed for a variety of reasons for example someone shooting at it with a rifle with the above summary of the general design of the pole transformer and the actual condition of the installation in question as a foundation we consider the immediate circumstances of the fire it was raining heavily on the night of september   as mentioned above the electrical insulator on the top of the cross bar of the utility pole was missing the fuse was broken in several pieces and the primary wire with a current of  volts was resting on the wooden cross bar mr mccowen gave the following testimony substantially corroborated by dr steber concerning the probable sequence of events at this point    when the rain started on the date of the accident the cross arm would have become damp its also contaminated with dirt and the like at this point in time the electrical energy in the primary wire probably started to arc from that wire to ground   when its trying to get to ground the nearest ground point it can find is a ground wire which is stapled underneath  this cross arm to connect the bottom part of the lightning arrester to the ground wire which goes down the pole a distance of perhaps three inches maybe four inches until it can find enough of a conducting path through the damp and wet cross arm nothing will happen as soon as the conducting path becomes energized the electricity will start to arc over the surface of the cross arm   at the point where the primary fuse cut out and fell in two    at that point in time the service to the transformer has been disconnected normal power flow is interrupted    with the normal service to the transformer interrupted by the fact that the fuse cutout has broken entirely in two and disconnected it with the arcing continuing from the primary wire across the cross arm it appears that the primarythe circuit was established between the primary wire and the case of the transformer   the primary power getting into the outside of the case of the transformer broke down the insulation between the transformer tank and the secondary windings of the transformer they probably had been damaged by the lightning surge which took place several days before   when the insulation breaks down to a sufficient point the fortyeight hundred volts would arc from the transformer tank through the insulating medium including the insulating oil to the secondary coil of the transformer and in doing this it would cause a violent burning at the same time the primary voltage rather than being transformed from fortyeight hundred volts to a hundred and twenty volts would be going directly into the secondary leads and through the secondary conductors in the service drop into the home at the same time this arcing is occurring under the oil the energy is very very high the oil would bubble it would burn it would generate tremendous amounts of gas and in a very short period of time probably in a matter of seconds would blow the cover off the transformer and the cover was blown off the transformer in this case after the explosion mccowen further testified the secondary bushings were blown out and fused together  consequently an electrical path formed from the  volt sideor the primary sideto the secondary side which led directly to the house the house was protected by circuit breakers or fuses however electrical service entrances to residences have a maximum voltage rating of  volts as the expert testimony revealed applying a voltage in excess of the voltage rating of the fuses andor circuit breakers for the home circumvents their function the circuit breakers in the house were consequently of very little value under the circumstances with respect to the actual cause of the fire it was mr mccowens professional opinion that the high voltage which through a unique set of circumstances entered the plaintiffs premises caused the incident he further testified that a system which would be able to prevent the type of accident would be too expensive in terms of personnel and unacceptable in terms of the time customers would be required to stay without power pending reconnection dr steber gave his expert opinion that the high voltage of between xxxxxxxx volts was unreasonably dangerous as applied to a residential home while he could not say definitely that it did in fact cause the fire he did say that there was enough voltage and enough current to cause it however dr steber took issue with the position of the defendant that the voltage that reached the house was not actually supplied by the company declaringobviously the electricity came from the wisconsin electric power company the first assistant chief of the waukesha fire department at the time of the fire testified that his investigation of the remains of the building indicated that the fire was caused by an overload of electricity in the service entrance of the home at the close of the testimony the defendant electric company moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that the evidence demonstrated that the  volt electricity  escaped from the control of the wisconsin electric power company before it could be placed in the stream of commerce the court reserved ruling on the motion until after the verdict a special verdict with the following three questions was submitted to the jury on september   question no  was the electricity when it left the possession of the wisconsin electric power company in such defective condition as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective consumer question no  if you answer question no  yes then answer this question was such defective condition a cause of damage to the plaintiffs house question no  what sum of money will reasonably compensate the plaintiffs for the damage to their house after three hours deliberation the jury returned the verdict with an answer of no to the first question and  to the third plaintiffs motion for a change in the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied the issues as we see them are as follows  does the doctrine of strict liability in tort as defined in dippel v sciano  wis d   nwd   apply to electricity  did the trial court err in refusing to set aside the jurys answer to question no  of the special verdict that the electricity when it left the possession of the wisconsin electric power company was in such defective condition as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective consumer  should public policy considerations preclude the imposition of strict liability under the facts of this case this is a products liability action and is founded upon sec a restatement  torts d pp  as adopted and modified by this court in dippel v sciano supra  wisd at  the section reads as follows  sec a special liability of seller of product for physical harm to user or consumer  one who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer or to his property if a the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product and b it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold  the rule stated in subsection  applies although a the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product and b the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller  the courts modification of this rule in dippel was intended merely to accommodate wisconsins system of tort liability which includes the principle of comparative negligence under which the plaintiff is subject to a diminution of his damages in the event that and to the extent that he contributed to the injuries   strict liability does not make the manufacturer or seller an insurer nor does it impose absolute liability it is not enough for the plaintiff merely to show that he was using the product and he was injured in the language of dippel at  the plaintiff must prove  that the product was in defective condition when it left the possession or  control of the seller  that it was unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer  that the defect was a cause a substantial factor of the plaintiffs injuries or damages  that the seller engaged in the business of selling such product or put negatively that this is not an isolated or infrequent transaction not related to the principal business of the seller and  that the product was one which the seller expected to and did reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition it was when he sold it furthermore certain defenses are available to the manufacturer or seller contributory negligence misuse abuse or alteration of the product inherent or unavoidable danger natural wear assumption of risk id this court in dippel at  summarized the solid public policy considerations which underlie the rule the reason which has been reiterated most often is that the seller is in the paramount position to distribute the costs of the risks created by the defective product he is selling he may pass the cost on to the consumer via increased prices he may protect himself either by purchasing insurance or by a form of selfinsurance in justification of making the seller pay for the risk it is argued that the consumer or user has the right to rely on the apparent safety of the product and that it is the seller in the first instance who creates the risk by placing the defective product on the market a correlative consideration where the manufacturer is concerned is that the manufacturer has the greatest ability to control the risk created by his product since he may initiate or adopt inspection and quality control measures thereby preventing defective products from reaching the consumer comment c of sec a restatement  torts d at  provides this analysis of the policy basis for the rule    the seller by marketing his product for use and consumption has undertaken and assumed a special responsibility toward any member of the consuming  public who may be injured by it    public policy demands that the burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for consumption be placed upon those who market them and be treated as a cost of production against which liability insurance can be obtained and that the consumer of such products is entitled to the maximum of protection at the hands of someone and the proper persons to afford it are those who market the products these social policy justifications must be kept in mind in applying the strict liability rules set forth above to the facts of the present case the defendant electric power company makes the argument that as a general matter the rule of strict liability in tort is inapplicable to the sale of electricity the company bases this contention on its view that electricity is not a product and on this courts holding in kemp v wisconsin electric power co  wis d   nwd   we believe the companys understanding of the scope of the term product is mistaken and its reliance on kemp is misplaced kemp involved an action for damages for injuries sustained when the child plaintiff contacted the electric power company line while controlling a gasoline powered model airplane significantly the court held that strict liability as defined in dippel supra  wis d at  had no application to the facts of the case since the electricity which injured daniel kemp had not been sold but was still in the control of the defendant the reasoning of the court in disposing of the strict liability issue is in fact authority for the proposition that wisconsin had implicitly adopted the view that electricity is a product subject to the rule of strict liability in the appropriate case logically the courts citation of the words of oesterreich v claas  wis    nw   that    the liability is nevertheless grounded upon negligence and is not the liability of  an insurer   must be understood to refer to situations where the electricity has not yet been sold and strict liability concepts cannot come into play in kemp the injured party was neither a purchaser nor a user here the plaintiffs were both to classify electricity as a product by virtue of the definition we have set forth above is warranted indeed mandated by the social policies which underlie and justify the imposition of strict liability on sellers who place dangerously defective products into the stream of commerce  we agree with the trial courts conclusion that electricity can be a product within the meaning of sec a and therefore subject to principles of strict liability in tort in appropriate cases the sole fact that the rule of strict liability in tort can be applied to the sale of electricity is insufficient to impose liability on the electric company in the present case plaintiffs were obliged to prove that the electricity when it left the possession of the electric company was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or his property   in vincer v esther wms allalum s pool co  wis d    nwd   this court cited and applied the following restatement definitions for defective condition and unreasonably dangerous comment g to sec a of restatement  torts d defines defective condition in part as follows g defective condition the rule stated in this section applies only where the product is at the time it leaves the sellers hands in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer which will be unreasonably dangerous to him    comment i to sec a of the restatement defines unreasonably dangerous in part as follows  i unreasonably dangerous the rule stated in this section applies only where the defective condition of the product makes it unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer many products cannot possibly be made entirely safe for all consumption and any food or drug necessarily involves some risk of harm if only from overconsumption ordinary sugar is a deadly poison to diabetics and castor oil found use under mussolini as an instrument of torture that is not what is meant by unreasonably dangerous in this section the article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics emphasis supplied  the court id at p  elaborated further on the applicable standard thus the test in wisconsin of whether a product contains an unreasonably dangerous defect depends upon the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer concerning the characteristics of this type of product if the average consumer would reasonably anticipate the dangerous condition of the product and fully appreciate the attendant risk of injury it would not be unreasonably dangerous and defective this is an objective test and is not dependent upon the knowledge of the particular injured consumer     despite the formulation of this general test this court has held that defect is not susceptible of any general definition and can only be defined on a casebycase basis jagmin v simonds abrasive co  wis d    nwd   see also annot   alr d   sec  b turning again to the facts of this case we begin with the proposition that strict liability may be imposed on the electric company only if the electricity when it left the sellers hands was in a condition not contemplated  by the ultimate consumer and unreasonably dangerous to him ie dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer with regard to this issue the trial court instructed the jury in relevant part as follows a product is said to be defective when it is not reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which such product was sold and intended to be used and the defect arose out of the design manufacture or inspection while the article was in control of the seller a defective product is unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer when it is dangerous to an extent beyond which would be contemplated by the ordinary user or consumer possessing the knowledge of the products characteristics which were common to the community cf  wis j icivil part ii  the electricity which passed through the electric meter controlled by the defendant electric power company and into the plaintiffs house had a voltage between  and  volts it was undisputed that  volts was the voltage normally distributed to residental consumers and was the voltage the plaintiffs had actually purchased for their house the evidence was also clear and uncontroverted that such high voltage was unreasonably dangerous for use in a residental home and did in fact cause the fire which occurred on september   while  volt electricity may be safe and suitable for some purposes it is clear from the evidence in this case that such voltage as applied to an ordinary private residence is defective and unreasonably dangerous within the meaning of the products liability doctrine as adopted in wisconsin indicative of the fact that the possibility of such an excessively high electrical overload rendered the electricity dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchased it is the fact that ordinary  homes are protected by circuit breakers or fuses with a maximum voltage rating of only  volts  review of the evidence in the present case reveals that the testimony and evidence is insufficient to sustain the jury verdict we believe the credible evidence in this case unequivocally leads to but one findingthe electricity when it left the possession of the wisconsin electric power company was in such defective condition as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective customer it follows that the trial court should have granted the motion to change the answer of question no  from no to yes  the electric company contends that the jury verdict can also be sustained on the ground that the electricity left the companys possession before passing through the electricity service entrance and into the plaintiffs house the company bases this argument on the testimony of mr mccowen that at some point in the sequence of events leading up to the fire the  volt electricity in the primary wires arced across the surface of the crossarm to the transformer case thus triggering the events which culminated in the explosion of the transformer the fusing together of the secondary bushings and finally the passage of the  volt electricity to the secondary wires leading to the plaintiffs house we do not believe this argument is meritorious the  volt electricity was in the control of wisconsin electric power company as it passedhowever it passedalong the primary wires through the transformer over the secondary wires and up to the electric meter owned and controlled by the defendant company it did not leave the defendants possession until it passed through the electric meter the point at which the sale is made and into the customers house given the characteristics of  electricity any other conclusion would unreasonably insulate a power company from liabilityeven under a negligence theory  the respondent also asserted the defense that an act of god ie lightning was an intervening superseding cause of the fire this court has never specifically declared that this defense is available in a products liability action dippel supra  wis d  makes it clear that the plaintiff is required to prove causation ie that the defect in the product was a cause substantial factor of the plaintiffs injuries or damages it would seem logical therefore that an act of god defenseas it affects causationmight be available in some limited circumstances it is questionable however whether lightning striking a utility pole could or should come within the act of god doctrine under the circumstances of the present case lightning strikes are a fairly frequent foreseeable and recurring problem for one engaged in the generation and distribution of electricity indeed electric power lines and utility pole installations are equipped with special safety devices to minimize the consequences of just such occurrences the defense therefore should not be available to the electric company to relieve it of strict liability for its defective and unreasonably dangerous product in this case many years ago in jackson v wisconsin telephone co  wis    nw   this court said the further argument is made that the stroke of lightning was the act of god for which no one is responsible certainly a stroke of lightning is an act of god but that is not the question here presented or rather another elementie the negligence of manis added to the question which materially alters its scope if i owning a high mast or building which i know is so situated as to be likely to be struck by lightning construct an attractive path for the lightning to my neighbors  roof so that his house is destroyed by a bolt which strikes my mast or building shall i escape liability for my negligent or wrongful act by pleading that the lightning was the act of god certainly not i invited the stroke of one of the most destructive powers of nature and negligently turned its course to my neighbors property the principle is the same as that involved in the case of borchardt v wausau boom co  wis  the lightning stroke is in no greater degree the act of god than the usual freshets occurring in a river the defendantrespondent also argues that public policy factors should preclude the imposition of liability in this case  the relevant public policy considerations weigh heavily in favor of the consumer in the present case consumer selfprotection from the defective and unreasonably dangerous product namely electricity of an excessively high voltage is not feasible in the case of the ordinary consumer abstention from use of the product is unrealistic electric power supplied by a sole electric company is generally the sole source of electricity in addition the seller here is in a better position to anticipate protect against and eliminate possible dangerous electricity overloads of this type finally the seller can more easily absorb or spread or insure against any financial losses which result public policy considerations do not preclude the imposition of liability in this case we therefore conclude that the trial court should have granted the plaintiffs motion to change the answers to questions  and  of the verdict to yes and the motion  for judgment notwithstanding the verdict judgment should be for the plaintiffs by the court judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion notes  motion for reconsideration denied with  costs on may    arching is the ability of electricity to jump from one point to another it is the passage of electricity through the air not along or through a conductor  dippel v sciano supra  wisd at  barter v general motors corp  wis d    nwd    dippel v sciano supra  wisd at
