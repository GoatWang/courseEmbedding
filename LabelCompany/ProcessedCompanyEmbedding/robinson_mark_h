montana here’s another gem from stanley – the no 7 side rabbet plane it was used for cleaning up roughcut rabbets and has two cutters one for cutting in each direction left or right in production from 7 it was a somewhat cheaper alternative to buying the no  and no  right and left pair which went out of production around  even without the type two sweetheart irons which appear to be original and would put it between  first date of manufacture and  last date of the sweetheart logo we can date this example to pre because of the large semicircular cutout in the main casting later examples did not have this and added a full length detachable depth stop what fascinates me about this plane is that through heavy use the nickel plate has worn off pretty well anywhere that it would be touched and held by the user – not unusual in itself but in this case it appears to be nickel over copper plate on the main casting i’ve never noticed this before and to me it makes the evidence of wear appear almost artistic incidentally the background is the lid of an as yet unidentified stanley toolbox featuring original yellow and blue paint from the sweetheart era based on the tools it contained
