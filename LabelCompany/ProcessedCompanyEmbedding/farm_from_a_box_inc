footprint with new “local getaways” site amazon destinations climate change is real and it is getting uglier global temperatures are continuing to rise placing enormous strain on water and food supplies throughout the world many areas have been hit hard by the climate disruption but none more prominently than california where the state has entered its fourth year of drought with massively diminishing water supplies and hectares of fallow land water supplies may not be top of mind for many techies in the bay area – tartine and blue bottle’s recent marriage is unlikely to be thwarted by some tap water problems the challenge is that agriculture is a huge industry not just for california but for the united states the state produced almost a fifth of the country’s total agriculture output worth almost  billion in  with water supplies tightening there has been growing attention to the high environmental costs of growing almonds and producing meat in increasingly arid conditions freight farms a startup based in decidedly notverydroughtlikethesedays boston is hoping to completely change the future of food production by massively increasing the water efficiency of farming while democratizing farming to everyone particularly into urban areas the company’s product is a freighttrucksized farminabox with all the necessary equipment and storage required to grow produce freight farms follows the “car model” of releasing a new hardware update once per year and the company just released its  model jon friedman president and cofounder of the startup described it as the “culmination of all the performance we have been trying to put into one complete system” the current system measured against traditional agriculture can save up to  of water usage and may even be able to go offgrid soon through solar or wind energy even better this efficiency is increasing all the time in a silicon valleymeetsagriculture moment the farms autoupdate their software to the latest versions over the internet the return of urban farming farming remains deeply connected to the origins of civilization the excess supply of food from agriculture allowed huntergatherers to stop moving and settle down creating the first human societies ironically though our beacons of civilization – our cities – are practically devoid of crops and these days most urban dwellers may never see where their food actually comes from that has started to change as community gardens rise in popularity and a slew of food movements like local cuisine encourage a different agricultural model freight farms sees itself as a key player in this urban food revolution “we started in urban rooftop development with hydroponics we realized that even people who had deep pockets it was really hard to produce food in an urban environment” friedman explains “what we set out to do is to create a tool for individuals who don’t have access to ton of land or rooftops or deep pockets but have the desire to feed their community or campus using what we have found to be the most viable space – brownfields sitting there and not providing value to the city” brownfields are areas that are complicated to develop due to contaminants or pollutants often creating holes in the fabric of a city the modular design of the freight farm allows it to be placed pretty much anywhere that has access to electricity and water and its insulation allows it to efficiently handle different climates the goal is to make approval of one of these farms in front of a city’s zoning committee much easier than a traditional farm which can often require extensive environmental reviews rethinking agriculture technology setting up the inside of a freight farm todd dagres a partner at spark capital led the firm’s  million investment in the startup late last year he sees a big opportunity in agriculture technology agtech “now is the time for information technology to take over and provide the next big boost in productivity” he said he particularly liked the urban farming movement since “the thought that each and every innercity neighborhood could grow its own food is incredibly powerful not just because it is a noble cause but because it is really practical as well” both dagres and the founders of freight farms really emphasized the value of the product for entrepreneurs brad mcnamara ceo and cofounder said the company has tried to make the transition to farming as painless as possible for potential customers “if you order lettuce all the lettuce nutrients come in the mail and we even have presets for the farm itself if you do want to tune to increase performance you can do that but it also has autopilot” some people start as hobbyists before going entirely commercial “generally first farmers will try a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and people get pretty wild in the farm when they start” mcnamara said “when people go commercial they tend to want to maximize” which means only growing one crop at a time inside the farm as might be expected a fullyintegrated farminabox doesn’t come cheap the current price of a freight farm comes in at  not a princely sum but certainly out of the range of most people who might want to get involved in farming as a hobby dagres of spark emphasized that there are many financing options available particularly farm loan programs from the federal government which offer low interest rates even for firsttime farmers longer term there is potential for these farms to move way beyond community gardens and hipster locallygrown restaurants “the notion that you could literally ship these on ships to places like africa and india is really exciting” dagres notes “but is probably not the lowesthanging fruit” as our weather becomes ever more unpredictable and extreme the need for food supply stability will increasingly become a top priority freight farms looks set to tap into that growing market all while building community in urban spaces featured image freight

john olson i want this where can i buy some ellinor sweeet i love it soo cool jan twowomenandahoe cool love this may all your gardens grow jan victoria lyon fabulous i wish these were going to be available by summer however i am so impressed with the fact that echo tech is being so responsible and going through all of the necessary testing to make sure that they are providing a growing system that will be healthy for those eating the foods harvested from the boxes as well as good for the earth as they fashion these planters from recycled  compostable content no greenwashing here patty sechi a part of me the designer part loves this and wants it another part of me the one that values getting my hands in the soil says this is missing a lot of the important benefits of gardening – the relationship to the soil to the earth and to your plants i realize that not everyone has the space at home but as the director of a diverse community garden in greenwich ct i would encourage people to seek out a local community garden an additional benefit not listed above is the community experience which is as valuable and rewarding as growing your garden annette when can we get this tani conrad i was hoping farm in a box would have cows don tani thats a great idea i can grow food in my back yard but cows in a box now that i would buy robin plaskoff horton annette and all of you who have asked–i will let you know as soon as these become available robin plaskoff horton you make great points patty community gardens are wonderful in so many ways–not just for the gardening experience but as you say but for becoming part of a community i think ecotech envisions this product as an inexpensive solution for people who may not have access to or time to be part of a community garden or may not want to garden on a bigger scale it is for those perhaps who need some food security and for whom growing at least some of their won food would provide that keep me posted on your community garden robin plaskoff horton lol tani that would require a really big box… robin plaskoff horton i agree victoria that taking the time to test things and being honest about the process is indeed a sign of integrity patty sechi thanks for your thoughtful thoughts robin you are right that there is a place for all kinds of gardening and yeah i think cow in a box is the next big thing not sure how else to keep you posted on the garden so hope this is ok – we are just launching our website armstrongcourtcommunitygardenorg and are listed on the american community gardening association site too robin
