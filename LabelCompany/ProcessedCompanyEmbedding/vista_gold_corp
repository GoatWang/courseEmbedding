corp “vista” the “company” “we” or “our” nyse mkt vgz tsx vgz today announced the results of process area optimization studies that have the potential to enhance the project economics for the mt todd gold project in northern territory australia  the anticipated economic improvements are the result of process flowsheet changes that are expected to produce higher gold recoveries and lower process area operating costs  testing indicates that these objectives can be accomplished through selectively screening and rejecting subeconomic coarse crusher product prior to grinding resulting in opportunities for improved gold recovery through finer grinding and improved operating costs downstream of the grinding circuit   a conference call with management to discuss the results of the mt todd gold project optimization studies is scheduled for tuesday  november     at  pm mst summary of process area optimization results  earlier this year vista completed an independent review of the mt todd gold project  the combined input of the independent consultants and the project management team resulted in additional comminution and metallurgical recovery evaluations  these evaluations assessed opportunities to selectively remove below cutoff grade material from the process circuit after crushing  this results in less material being processed in the grinding and leaching circuits  the reduction in material results in excess grinding capacity which can be used to achieve a finer grind size in the final product and a corresponding increase in gold recovery for the remaining portion of the leach feed  achieving the finer grind size is not expected to materially change the total grinding costs  most importantly the higher gold recovery is expected to increase cash flow while the leaching cyanide detoxification and tailings management costs are expected to decrease as a result of the reduction in the volume of material processed we completed size distribution and assay analysis of the high pressure grinding rolls  “hpgr”  crusher product  this indicates that screening the hpgr crusher product at ” produces an oversize product that accounts for  of the weight but contains only  of the gold  subsequently we completed test work with tomra sorting solutions inc “tomra” at their facilities in germany to evaluate the recovery of sulfidequartzcalcitebearing material using laser reflectionfluorescence and xray transmission “xrt” automated sorting techniques  this test work indicates that approximately  of the gold in this oversize fraction can be efficiently recovered with a return of  of the weight  we expect this to translate into an  reduction in material to be processed in the grindingleaching circuits with a  loss in gold coming from the elimination of subeconomic material from the process stream if there is an  reduction in material passing to the grinding circuit we expect to achieve a final grind size of  passing “p”  microns “μm” approximately  finer than the final grind size used in our may  pfs of  μm  test work confirms that at a p  μm grind size we can expect to achieve gold recoveries in the range of  up from the  reported in the may  pfs     vista’s president  ceo frederick h earnest commented “the process improvements that we have identified have the potential to generate lower operating costs and better gold recoveries without adding materially to the capital costs of the project  these improvements coupled with the current us dollar to australian dollar exchange rate have the potential to produce a significant improvement in project economics  we are now evaluating an update of our preliminary feasibility study”     detailed discussion of metallurgical testing program results   mt todd deposit geology the mt todd deposit is hosted by a silicified sequence of greywackes siltstones and shales  this host is crosscut nearly perpendicular to the bedding planes by two different series of quartz and calcite veins  the injection of quartz and calciterich solution provided the transportation mechanism for the gold and other sulfide minerals found in the deposit  the gold in the mt todd deposit is associated with the veining and occurrence of sulfide minerals and is found only in small concentrations likely the result of microfracturing in the host rock  the quartzcalcite veining is pervasive throughout the deposit with vein thicknesses running from a couple of millimeters to several centimeters  vein density can vary from  to  veins per meter  selective assaying was completed to assess the presence of gold exclusively in the veins andor sulfides compared to the host rock  selective samples submitted to pine creek labs in pine creek northern territory australia indicated that carefully selected veins and sulfide samples contained   grams autonne of sample compared to  grams autonne of sample for the host rock  the relatively small proportions of veinsulfide material account for the average grade of the deposit and at the same time highlight the value of efforts to separate the host rock from the goldbearing veins and sulfides hpgr product screensize and gold distribution analysis in  we prepared two bulk samples representative of the mt todd deposit using metallurgical core dispersed across the deposit identified as m and m  these two samples were sent to thysen krupp industrial solutions’ hpgr testing facilities in germany for hpgr crushing tests  a total of approximately two tonnes of material between the two composites was crushed the hpgr crushed material was returned to vista for subsequent metallurgical testing  using hpgr crushed material from these two composites we undertook studies to evaluate the amount of material and amount of gold contained in various screen size fractions  the results of this analysis are summarized in the following table  this work including the subsequent sample prep was completed by resource development inc of wheatridge colorado “rdi” with assaying completed by florin analytical services in reno nevada click to enlarge based on this data and with some understanding of the minimum size requirements for selective automated sorting we determined that the ” screen oversize  provided a meaningful volume of material for our testing to evaluate selective sorting and rejection  this size was also selected because it is reasonable to expect that screening can be effectively achieved at this size in a full scale operation  physical observation of the ” material indicated visually identifiable portions of vein material and sulfide material  it was noted that the majority of the ” material showed no visual indications of veining or sulfides      automated sorting testing   automated sorting is employed by many industries and in the gold sector the coeur kensington mine is successfully operating an automated sorting circuit to recover higher grade ore before wasting the rejects  many different sensors are used today in sorting including but not limited to optical laser xrt near infrared visible light electromagnetic and color  a sample of ” oversize material was sent to tomra’s mining sorting division for testing testing was performed under the supervision of outotec personnel using xrt and laser sorting sensors  testing indicates that a combination of xrt and laser sorting methods could effectively identify the material containing quartzcalcite veining andor sulfide material for subsequent removal using automated air sorting technology a larger sorting test is planned to verify the promising indicative results the following table summarizes the results of test work completed by tomra under outotec supervision at tomra’s

testing as part of the comprehensive metallurgical testing completed in  we completed grind size optimization studies  those studies indicated that a p of  μm was the optimum grind size  at that time we recognized that finer grinding could result in higher gold recoveries but the additional capital ie larger mills and power could not be justified to achieve the incremental increase in gold recovery  with the successful completion of the screening and automated sorting tests we evaluated the relative advantages of downsizing the mills to match the expected throughput compared to maintaining the mill size and grinding to a finer size as part of the recent testing we completed grinding tests to achieve an initial product with a p of  μm  this product was subsequently screened to assess the relative proportion of material at size fractions from  mesh to minus  mesh  this screen analysis indicated that  of the ground material was minus  mesh and  of the material was plus  mesh  rdi completed an analysis of the energy requirements to grind to a finer size and determined that the ball mills selected for the project in the  pfs operating with  less feed from the crushers would be able to successfully produce a product with a p of  μm without any additional power demand  based on grindsize and leach recovery work completed in  and work recently completed by rdi we expect that total recoveries in the range of  can be achieved with mill product with a p of  μm  evaluation of potential to incorporate stage hpgr crushing in addition to the foregoing work we prepared additional core composite samples and sent them to kca in reno nevada for additional hpgr testing  we conducted a testing program to evaluate the potential to achieve significant additional size reduction through stage hpgr crushing  the objective of the program was to evaluate the potential to achieve sufficiently fine ball mill feed that even finer grinding and hence higher gold recoveries could be achieved  at this time we are not convinced that the additional capital and operating costs of stage hpgr crushing can be justified by the results but additional testing is
