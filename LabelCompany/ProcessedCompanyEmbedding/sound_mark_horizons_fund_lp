prospectus contains important detailed information about the horizons exchange traded products please read the relevant prospectus before investing the horizons exchange traded products consist of the horizons index etfs index etfs x daily bull and x daily bear etfs x daily etfs inverse etfs inverse etfs vix etfs defined below and active etfs the x daily etfs and certain other horizons exchange traded products use leveraged investment techniques that can magnify gains and losses and may result in greater volatility of returns these horizons exchange traded products are subject to leverage risk and may be subject to aggressive investment risk and price volatility risk which where applicable are described in their respective prospectuses each x daily etf seeks a return before fees and expenses that is either  or  of the performance of a specified underlying index commodity or benchmark the target for a single day each index etf or inverse etf seeks a return that is  or  respectively of the performance of a target due to the compounding of daily returns a x daily etfs or inverse etfs returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the performance of their respective targets for the same period the horizons exchange traded products whose target is the sp  vix shortterm futures index™ the vix etfs one of which is a x daily etf and one of which is an index etf as described in their prospectus are speculative investment tools that are not conventional investments the vix etfs target is highly volatile as a result the vix etfs are not generally viewed as standalone longterm investments historically the vix etfs target has tended to revert to a historical mean as a result the performance of the vix etfs target is expected to be negative over the longer term and neither the vix etfs nor their target are expected to have positive long term performance investors should monitor their holdings as frequently as daily to ensure that they remain consistent with their investment strategies the indicated rates of return are the historical annual compounded total returns including changes in per unit value and reinvestment of all dividends or distributions and do not take into account sales redemption distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any securityholder that would have reduced
