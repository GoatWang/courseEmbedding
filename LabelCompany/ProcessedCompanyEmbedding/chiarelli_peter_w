published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide the politics of military reform by peter w chiarelli book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide the authors contend that in recent years the political power base of the military reform movement has grown significantly in the future its influence on defense policymaking is likely to increase the study analyzes the politics of military reform but does not judge specific reform proposals or tactics the reform debates participants motivations interests strategies and linkages are examined the analysis is accomplished through the use of three case studies  the establishment of the office of operational test and evaluation with the office of the secretary of defense  the current weapon system procurement and spare parts controversy and  efforts concerning joint chiefs of staff reform and department of defense reorganization finally having analyzed the dynamics of the military reform movement and the responses it has elicited the authors propose a new strategy for department of defense decision makers so they may effectively participate in the process essays on

as advocates of parochial service interests as a result divided loyalties have traditionally barred the joint chiefs of staff from providing timely and effective advice to the president and the

years of congressional hearings the goldwaternichols dod reorganization act neither ended dualhatting nor replaced jcs it has however strengthened the role of the chairman and promoted jointness organizational realignment under goldwaternichols has not offset resource allocation problems which are what the services do  percent of the time replacing jcs with a national military advisory

stress and other mentalhealth injuries alex wonggetty images by greg jaffe by greg jaffe january   follow gregjaffe gen peter w chiarelli the army’s vice chief of staff is leaving the army in much the same manner that he served in it over the past decade as an iconoclast the general who retires tuesday used a final interview with the washington post to argue that the law banning women from combat jobs in the military was an unnecessary anachronism — and that women are already effectively serving in combat roles “i have felt for the longest period of time that on a nonlinear battlefield there are no safe jobs” he said “everyone is in a situation where they are in fact in harm’s way” chiarelli insisted that the army should set clear physical standards for combat jobs and then require men and women to meet them “there is this mistaken belief that somehow that through prohibiting women in combat jobs we can protect them” chiarelli said “i would rather have standards that we apply across the board” chiarelli made his case for allowing women to hold combat jobs as he prepared to leave the military after more than  years of service including two combat tours in iraq both tours came during periods when the insurgency in iraq appeared to be gaining strength and us casualties were mounting as the army’s secondhighestranking general in the pentagon chiarelli has pressed harder than any other officer to change the way soldiers view posttraumatic stress and other mentalhealth injuries so far his efforts have not yielded a reduction in the army’s recordhigh suicide rate — a source of disappointment to the general chiarelli’s passionate advocacy and willingness to criticize his own service however have won him admirers in the pentagon and among soldiers and their families “going to combat with the st cavalry division is something i will always remember    but the thing that i have done that has given me the most satisfaction is to try to at least begin the process of eliminating the stigma associated with behavioralhealth issues” he said in  about  soldiers sought mentalhealth counseling for wounds such as post traumatic stress “everybody gasped and i said that i hope it goes up higher than that” chiarelli said last year more than  soldiers received treatment or counseling from behavioralhealth specialists chiarelli  tackled the issue of soldiers’ mental health at a time when the army’s suicide rate was spiking he has pressed to ensure that soldiers receive more intensive mentalhealth screening after deployments and to hire more behavioralhealth specialists at army bases each month he meets with commanders around the globe by video teleconference to review the details of recent suicides in an attempt to identify trends and possible missed opportunities in which commanders could have intervened the conferences which last two hours are described as gutwrenching last year a record  activeduty troops committed suicide compared with about  the previous year although suicides among activeduty troops remain high chiarelli says that improved diagnosis and treatment of these hidden mental wounds has helped stem the increase in suicides the army was experiencing before  these days he looks for glimmers of progress in statistics that others might see as deeply troubling for example the number of hospitalizations of troops who have suicidal thoughts has increased every year since he became vice chief of staff in  “i look at that and say leaders are involved and are not ignoring things that they once ignored when it comes to this area” he said recently defense secretary leon e panetta asked chiarelli to retire from the army and serve as undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness one of the pentagon’s most senior civilian jobs the position would have allowed chiarelli to remain involved in mentalhealth issues but he turned it down to return to washington state “i have my mom on the west coast all by herself” he said “she turns  on february th i have a family responsibility after  years of service to be with her” he acknowledged that he leaves behind many problems including a medical system that is poorly structured to treat the mental wounds of war “soldiers would tell me point blank that the doctor talks to me for five minutes and throws a bag of pills at me” chiarelli said “we have some real issues right now with the shortage of behavioralhealth experts and a business model that does not lend itself to taking care of these people in the most effective way” throughout his military career chiarelli has had a reputation as an innovator in baghdad’s sadr city he launched a massive effort to employ young men to fix the slum’s dilapidated sewer system his efforts helped shape the army’s approach to counterinsurgency warfare which stresses that winning the support of the people is as important as killing the enemy it’s unclear however whether another fourstar general will continue his efforts to improve mentalhealth care for soldiers “i think that anyone who looks at the numbers after a while is going to say ‘wow we have got a problem here’ ” he said “that is how i got involved in it    it is going to still need pushing” world nationalsecurity get  olympics updates by email our best news and analysis from rio delivered to your inbox postnewsletter magnetolympics false afterth

completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
