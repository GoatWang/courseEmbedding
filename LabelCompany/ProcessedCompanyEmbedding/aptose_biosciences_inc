may  ohsu and aptose present cg’ preclinical data demonstrating potent activity against patient samples at aacr hematologic malignancies meeting may   aptose biosciences is a sciencedriven biotechnology company advancing firstinclass agents to treat lifethreatening cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia aml highrisk myelodysplastic syndromes mds and other hematologic malignancies based on insights into the genetic and epigenetic profiles of certain cancers and patient populations aptose is building a pipeline of novel oncology therapies directed at dysregulated processes and signaling pathways aptose is developing targeted medicines for precision treatment of these diseases based on a patient’s specific gene expression signature in the treatment of cancer this strategy is intended to optimize efficacy and quality of life by minimizing the cytotoxic side effects associated with conventional therapies cg cg’ is a highly potent firstinclass panfltbtk inhibitor this small molecule therapeutic agent exhibits a picomolar ic toward the fmslike tyrosine kinase  with the internal tandem duplication fltitd and significant potency against other mutant forms of flt because of the potency of cg’ against the flt enzyme it may become an effective therapy for aml patients including the subset of patients having the fltitd which occurs in approximately  of patients with aml and is associated with poor prognosis importantly cg’ targets other oncogenic kinases which may also be operative in aml thereby potentially allowing the agent to become an important therapeutic option for a difficulttotreat patient population in addition to potent inhibition of wild type and mutant forms of the flt enzyme cg’ is a highly potent reversible noncovalent inhibitor of the wild type and mutant forms of the btk enzymes overexpression of btk drives certain b cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll mantle cell lymphoma mcl diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl and others treatment of such b cell malignancies with covalent btk inhibitors that target the cysteine residue in the active site of btk can lead to drug resistance via mutation of the cysteine amino acid residue to a serine residue btkcs mutant cg’ targets the atpbinding pocket of btk through a reversible noncovalent mechanism thereby allowing cg’ to retain low nm potency against the btkcs mutant enzyme thus cg’ may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat b cell malignancy patients that are refractory resistant or intolerant to covalent btk inhibitors apto the company’s second program is a small molecule therapeutic agent that inhibits expression of the cmyc oncogene without causing general myelosuppression of the bone marrow the cmyc oncogene is overexpressed in hematologic cancers including aml cmyc is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth proliferation differentiation and apoptosis and overexpression amplifies new sets of genes to promote oncogenesis apto dramatically downregulates expression of the cmyc oncogene in aml cells and depletes those cells of the cmyc oncoprotein leading to apoptotic cell death in aml cells thus apto may serve as safe and effective cmyc inhibitor for aml that combines well with other agents and does not impact the normal bone marrow aptose’s leadership team comprises accomplished industry financial and clinical research professionals who are dedicated to building a comprehensive anticancer drug pipeline and clinical development programs focused on targeted therapeutics directed against dysregulated oncogenic
