exchange commission on february   the original k to correct a statement in the original k regarding the absence of reportable events as that term is defined in regulationsk itemav during the companys two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period from january   through the date of lurie llps lurie dismissal there were no reportable events as that term is defined in item av of regulation sk except that in connection with its audit of the companys financial statements for the year ended december   lurie reported the existence of two material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting of titan cng llc titan a whollyowned subsidiary of the company to the board of managers of titan the ineffectiveness of titans internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses  a lack of internal control procedures and of proper review and approval procedures with regards to titans consolidated financial statements and monthly close process and  a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in the companys financial reporting process and accounting function as a result of the companys limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel and implementation of accounting systems until such time as the company expands its staff to include additional accounting personnel and hire a full time chief financial officer it is likely the company will continue to report material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting these material weaknesses have not been corrected except for the added disclosure that there were reportable events as that term is defined in item av of regulation sk this ka does not amend or update any other information contained in the original k the company has provided lurie with a copy of the foregoing statements and has requested and received from lurie a copy of the letter addressed to the securities and exchange commission
