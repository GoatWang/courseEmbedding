the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission for the presentation of interim financial information but do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements  the audited financial statements for the years ended december   and  are included in the annual report on form k of satya worldwide inc which was filed on march   with the securities and exchange commission and are hereby referenced  in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included  operating results for the three month period ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended december   note   description of business satya worldwide inc the company we us our until january   provided digital book ebook distribution services epublishing services to authors poets memoirists and publishers for distributing their ebooks to online bookstores book conversion editing book cover design and isbn number administration  satya worldwide inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on march   commencing business as a development stage company  as of may  we have refocused our business to developing fantasy sports entertainment products   note  – going concern the companys financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business  the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable  if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations  these conditions raise substantial doubt as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern managements plan to continue as a going concern   our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable business operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities to date we have operated at a loss and remained in business through the issuance of shares of our common stock and generating revenues from our business activities  managements plan to continue as a going concern is based on us obtaining additional capital resources through the sale of our securities andor loans on an as needed basis  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described above and eventually attaining profitable operations            table of contents       since its inception the company has been dependent upon the receipt of capital investment to fund its continuing activities  in addition to the normal risks associated with a new business venture there can be no assurance that the companys business plan will be successfully executed our ability to execute our business plan will depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and achieve a profitable level of operations there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be obtained  further we cannot give any assurance that we will generate substantial revenues or that our business operations will prove to be profitable   note  equity transactions in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to an investor for a total purchase price of  the stock purchase represented a change of control of the company since the purchaser nuvolari limited a gibraltar corporation obtained voting control of the company in january  we redeemed  shares of our common stock from brisance capital our former majority stockholder for a total redemption price of    note  – subsequent events on may   we acquired  of global fantasy sports inc a florida corporation gfs making gfs a whollyowned subsidiary of the company  in consideration for the acquisition we issued the stockholders of gfs a total of  newly issued shares of our common stock prior to the acquisition the majority stockholder of gfs was our chief executive officer the transaction will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition                        table of contents item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing in this report and are hereby referenced  the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this report you should not place undue certainty on these forwardlooking statements which apply only as of the date of this report  we believe it is important to communicate our expectations however our management disclaims any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise these forwardlooking statements are based on our managements current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations  you should not rely upon these forwardlooking statements as predictions of future events because we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur  you can identify a forwardlooking statement by the use of the forwardterminology including words such as may will believes anticipates estimates expects continues should seeks intends plans andor words of similar import or the negative of these words and phrases or other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology  these forwardlooking statements relate to among other things our sales results of operations and anticipated cash flows capital expenditures depreciation and amortization expenses sales general and administrative expenses our ability to maintain and develop relationship with our existing and potential future customers  and our ability to maintain a level of investment that is required to remain competitive  many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forwardlooking statements including but not limited to variability of our revenues and financial performance risks associated with technological changes the acceptance of our products in the marketplace by existing and potential customers disruption of operations or increases in expenses due to our involvement with litigation or caused by civil or political unrest or other catastrophic events general economic conditions government mandates and the continued employment of our key personnel and other risks associated with competition overview   during  we decided to no longer engage in the business of publishing ebooks and to pursue a different line of business for the company  in may  we acquired global fantasy sports inc a florida corporation gfs which is a developer of online daily fantasy sports games  as a result of our gfs acquisition the company is now pursuing opportunities in the online fantasy sports entertainment industry and as of december   we wrote off our assets associated with ebook publishing which were minimal the reader should note that the results of operation shown in this annual report reflect the companys prior ebook publishing business operations and do not reflect the companys current business operation business plans and financial results   information regarding the audited financial results for gfs for the year ended december   can be found in our form k current report filed on june                  table of contents         the following discussion and analysis reflects our legacy ebook publishing business as of december   and does not reflect our new business as a provided of online sports entertainment products through our recently acquired gfs subsidiary information regarding the audited financial results for gfs for the year ended december   can be found in our form k current report filed on june       three month period ended march   compared to march   revenues   for the quarter ended march   revenues were  a decrease of  from the same period in  when revenues were  from book royalties from our literary catalog     selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of corporate support expenses such as legal and accounting and organizational expenses  for the three month period ended march   selling general and administrative expenses were   an increase of  or  from the same period in  when selling general and administrative expenses were  the large increase was due primarily to professional fees and consulting fees related to our planned acquisition of gfs liquidity and capital resources to date we have financed our operations primarily from the sale of our common stock as of march   we had no and an accumulated deficit of  future liquidity needs we believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs including our cash needs for working capital for the next  months  thus we expect to seek additional debt or equity financing from external sources which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the amount of additional financing we require will be dependant upon several factors including the amount of our revenue during such  month period future business conditions and other future developments failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition to the extent that the company raise additional funds by issuing equity or debt securities our shareholders may experience additional significant dilution and such financing may involve restrictive covenants to the extent that the company raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the company such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business   additionally recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition including our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs              table of contents           going concern these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty critical accounting policies and estimates   our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods  actual results could differ from these estimates our significant estimates and assumptions include amortization the fair value of our stock and the valuation allowance relating to the companys deferred tax assets   we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act which became law in april  see summary of financial data for additional information    off balance sheet arrangements   as of march   and december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements   item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   disclosure under this section is not required for a smaller reporting company item   controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the securities exchange act of  the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures  in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures                table of contents         as required by sec rule ab we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fiscal quarter covered by this report based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level  it should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management of is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and financial officer and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that   · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company   · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and   · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate the companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of march   in making this assessment the companys management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework the coso framework is based upon five integrated components of control control environment risk assessment control activities information and communications and ongoing monitoring              table of contents         based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act were not effective as of march   the evaluation date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to the companys management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure each of the following is deemed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting ● we do not have an audit committee while we are not currently obligated to have an audit committee including a member who is an audit committee financial expert as defined in item  of regulation sk under applicable regulations or listing standards however it is managements view that such a committee is an important internal control over financial reporting the lack of which may result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of internal controls and procedures ● we did not maintain proper segregation of duties for the preparation of our financial statements  we currently have only one officer overseeing all transactions this has resulted in several deficiencies including the lack of control over preparation of financial statements and proper application of accounting management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in the two items above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods managements remediation initiatives   in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we plan to initiate the following series of measures once we have the financial resources to do so ● we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee which will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us ● management believes that the appointment of outside directors to a fully functioning audit committee would remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee     ● we currently have inadequate resources due to the need to hire accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of us gaap     ● we did not perform an effective risk assessment or monitor internal controls over financial reporting     ● we lack the necessary corporate resources to conduct adequate review of related party transactions              table of
