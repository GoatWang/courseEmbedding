many years the ceo of market research company information resources inc iri and magid abraham who was also an exiri employee and had served as president of iri in the mids magid and gian came up with the idea while working with one of the original investors in the company mike santer who thought up the concept of creating a very large consumer panel online to track online commerce the problem was that the traditional methods in which companies were tracking online behavior would not work in tracking commerce because of the lower incidence of buying online normal panels in tracking visitation would be around k and with less than  of the population buying online the panel size needed to be at least mm they decided to build a very large panel using more aggressive recruiting methodology and managing for the error by using advanced statistical methods and controls years and tens of millions of dollars went into finding the best ways to measure online buying and other behaviors plus the level of accuracy required for fortune  companies to buycitation needed in  comscore bought certain assets and the customer agreements of pc data of reston virginia which was founded by ann stephens

monitoring software has been bundled with file sharing program imesh without users being aware of it although comscores relationship with imesh was shortlived and occurred several years ago in the past the software forwarded users internet traffic through comscore proxy servers provoking criticism about speed performance as a result several universities and banks took steps to block the proxy servers in response to these concerns comscore no longer uses this technologycitation needed in june  a warning about mac spyware being launched from free applications like screensavers from security company intego was reported in the media and implicated voicefive inc as the source of certain alleged spyware software additionally noted blogger and angel investor jason calacanis claimed that

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans
