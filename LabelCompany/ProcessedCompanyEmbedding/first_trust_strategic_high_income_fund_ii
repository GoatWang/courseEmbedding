rather than net asset value nav which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than nav premium or less than nav discount  most recent distribution paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution see the funds a notices if any located under the news  literature section of the website for estimates of distribution sources final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after yearend  a measure of a bonds sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bonds price given a change in yield it accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements  total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions at prices obtained by the dividend reinvestment plan if any and changes in the nav and share price the nav total return takes into account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost the debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks including issuer risk reinvestment risk prepayment risk credit risk and interest rate risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixedincome securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the funds portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolios current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixedincome securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates residential mortgagebacked securities may have less potential for capital appreciation than comparable fixedincome securities due to the likelihood of increased prepayments of mortgages as interest rates decline the fund invests in noninvestment grade debt instruments commonly referred to as highyield securities high yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings lowerquality debt tends to be less liquid than higherquality debt the fund invests in securities of nonus issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of us issuers risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries because the fund invests in nonus securities you may lose money if the local currency of a nonus market depreciates against the us dollar use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the
