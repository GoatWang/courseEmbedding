the average library budget within our region is  when you exclude our  largest libraries the average budget is  it is difficult for a family of four to flourish on an annual income of  you can only imagine how difficult is for an organization charged to provide services to an entire community the impact of increased  state funding to libraries is and will be significant although libraries are still not funded at the prescribed levels as written in education law the increases received in this years budget have enabled us to provide direct relief to public libraries and community members for the first time since  our library system is in a position to add an additional fulltime professional for the purpose of assisting rural libraries navigate the challenges of meeting state minimum standards and professional best practices this professional can empower  libraries to develop improve and increase learning opportunities within our communities for example our libraries were visited  times in  for public computing access  of these visits required some form of training between a librarian and community member additionally libraries provided  public computing classes in this same time period by adding one more professional to the southern tier library system we can predict this type of engagement will increase notably in the coming years through curriculum development training and public awareness moreover added funds will allow our libraries to expand digital collections to communities  of library transactions take place online our libraries provide ebooks downloadable audio books music downloads and streaming movie streaming and online magazine subscriptions through increased state funding we are able to maximize community savings by increasing the titles in our digital collections community members in our region downloaded  materials last year and realized  million in cost savings these savings will go up significantly next year as libraries increase their

practices most of our library directors have obtained some level of college education only four libraries require a masters degree in library science based on state minimum standards the lowest annual salary of a library director in our region is  parttime the highest annual library director salary is  fulltime who oversees five library outlets the median library director salary is  fulltime a starting teachers salary in new york state is  plus benefits only six of our libraries provide access to medical or retirement plans one of the core competencies of the southern tier library system is to provide training to rural librarians this is where increased funding will have a meaningful impact on library system services our library system can increase its training budget by  which is significant considering our  budget for training was  when state aid to libraries is reduced or remains stagnant this is the first place library systems cut in order to meet library demands however taking into account current training needs this is the one area library systems should always be investing lastly economic development throughout the southern tier will be improved as a result of the  state allocation to libraries recently southern tier library system was awarded  in federal erate funding to upgrade wireless internet hardware within all  library outlets we also expect another  in federal grants to connect our libraries to dark fiber broadband infrastructure these federal funds along with funds through new york state public library construction aid will empower our residents to have access to broadband connectivity that far exceeds new york state broadband standards this level of access will come through the  plus public computers in our public libraries in addition to providing a highlevel of internet connectivity our libraries will partner with local governments to drive down costs for businesses to connect to dark fiber broadband connecting southern tier
