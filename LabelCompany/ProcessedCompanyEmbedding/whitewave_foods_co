supplies horizon organic milk for the whitewave foods company credit caleb kenna for the new york times danone the french company that sells stonyfield yogurt and evian water said on thursday that it had agreed to buy the whitewave foods company — maker of horizon organic dairy products and earthbound farm salad greens among other brands — for about  billion in cashthe deal aimed at enhancing the american profile of the company that makes dannon and activia yogurts will significantly increase danone’s presence in the lucrative organic foods market also through whitewave’s ownership of the silk brand of soy and nut milks the purchase will give danone a toehold in the flourishing market for plantbased dairy substitutesthe acquisition underscores danone’s determination to do a better job meeting the changing tastes of consumers including by shifting aggressively toward the use of organic milk which is more expensive than conventionalemmanuel faber chief executive of danone said in a telephone interview that the company’s plans were comprehensive from farm to table and were influenced by shifting cultural attitudes and tastes advertisement continue reading the main story “this is really about resilience over all and therefore the longterm adaptation of models of agriculture and eating and drinking practices” he said “consumers want diverse eating and drinking options but we

billion last year will almost instantly double the size of its business in north america where it is known as dannon to  percent of its portfolio from  percent the company said in a news releasedannon and general mills the maker of yoplait liberté mountain high and annie’s yogurts have struggled over the last few years to preserve market share against the sudden rise of chobani in particular and smaller yogurt brands like noosa and fage with more exotic flavors and “cleaner” ingredient listsabout the only way the traditional yogurt giants had left to set themselves apart from their scrappy new competitors was to embrace organic milk an expensive propositionthat’s because to win organic certification for milk the cows producing it must eat organic feed which has been in short supply over the last several years stonyfield the organic yogurt business owned by danone has struggled from time to time to get the milk it needs as have other producers of organic dairy productsgeneral mills recently announced a partnership with organic valley a large organic dairy cooperative to help support farmers who agree to go through the threeyear transition process required to convert conventional farmland to organic production those farmers will supply organic alfalfa grasses and other grains used to feed dairy cows whose milk will then be eligible for organic certification under federal regulations and dannon recently announced a program to radically overhaul its milk supply chain in the united states essentially locking in pricing deals with the farmers who supply roughly  percent of its milk needs in exchange those farmers have agreed to take certain steps to improve animal welfare and reduce their environmental footprintthey also have agreed to feed their cows nongmo feed but at the time the program was announced mariano lozano chief executive of dannon said it would be difficult to go a step further and require organic feed “organic goes far beyond and has extremely high standards” he said “it’s very expensive” advertisement continue reading the main story now however danone has apparently decided to simply buy an organic system under the terms of the transaction

manufacturer that sources organic ingredients you just have to think a little differently about the supply chain” said gregg engles the whitewave chairman and chief executivewhitewave which has a stable of plantbased brands including silk and vega also gives danone valuable insight into the plantbased drinks business mr faber said the company had dabbled in socalled alternative protein sources for roughly a decade building a plantbased brand in spain and experimenting with fermentation methods in indiamr engles said there were key differences between organic consumers and buyers of plantbased products “organic consumers are motivated by a host of things including first and foremost what they’re putting in their bodies and also what the production of that food has done to the land its impact on the environment” he said“plantbased buyers are motivated by some of the same things but have greater concern about sustainability” he continued “obviously plantbased proteins have a much smaller footprint on the environment than an organic dairy business”so might danone develop a plantbased yogurt “i’d love to see us make some hybrid plantdairy products in the future moving us to another level of excitement that balances nutrition with innovation to get the best benefit out of both” mr faber saidthe purchase the largest move by danone since mr faber took the top job in  has
