reduction in leverage is credit positive no impact to rating issuer comment kleopatra holdings  sca klöckner pentaplast’s acquisition of linpac adds to market share in food packaging financial structure yet to emerge lgd assessment kleopatra holdings  sca rating action moodys assigns pb rating to klöckners new term loan b downgrades cfr to b from b global credit research   jun  london  june   moodys investors service moodys has today assigned a pb rating to klöckner pentaplast of america incs new eur million senior secured first lien term loan b split between eur and usd tranches with a maturity of  years and at least eur million revolving credit facility rcf with a maturity of  years concurrently moodys has downgraded to b from b the corporate family rating cfr and to bpd from bpd the probability of default rating pdr of kleopatra holdings  sca klöckner the parent of plastic film packaging manufacturer klöckner pentaplast upon completion of the transaction moodys will withdraw the existing b instrument ratings of klöckner pentaplast gmbh klöckner pentaplast of america inc and kp germany erste gmbh as well as the caa senior unsecured notes rating of klöckner pentaplast of america inc the outlook on all ratings is stable moodys issues provisional ratings in advance of the final sale of securities and these ratings reflect moodys preliminary credit opinion regarding the transaction only upon a conclusive review of the final documentation moodys will endeavour to assign definitive ratings to the facilities a definitive rating may differ from a provisional rating ratings rationale todays rating action reflects klöckners announcement that it will issue a new eur billion equivalent term loan b and eur million holdco notes to refinance its existing debt fund the acquisition of linpac senior holdings limited linpac unrated a ukbased plastic film producer and thermoformer in both rigid and flexible plastics supplying into the food packaging industry across europe china and australia and finance a shareholder distribution both companies are owned by equity sponsor strategic value partners svp moodys views negatively the intention to fund a shareholder distribution to svp in the region of eur million the shareholder payout is further evidence of an aggressive financial policy which is not in line with the rating agencys expectation that klöckner will gradually reduce its leverage svp acquired a majority equity stake in klöckner in  for ceur million as part of a debt restructuring process the company issued additional debt to fund shareholder distributions in may  and april  totaling eur million the holdco notes issuance will not affect the companys moodysadjusted debtebitda metrics because kleopatra holdings  sca the issuer of the holdco notes is located outside of the restricted borrowing group the notes will be contractually and structurally subordinated to the term loan b and rcf and will have a later maturity date however subject to an available cash test and a liquidity test the company intends to pay cash interest on the notes which will negatively impact free cash flow and liquidity the transaction will increase moodys adjusted debtebitda by around x to x including factoring from x currently to x excluding factoring whereas moodys previous expectation was that adjusted gross leverage would gradually reduce the increase in leverage and weakening in klöckners credit metrics follow on from a worse than expected trading performance in the first half of fy  the downgrade to b reflects the companys very high financial leverage the initial margin dilution owing to linpacs exposure solely to the slower growth food and consumer packaging end markets which will increase the combined companys exposure to around  from  and deterioration in free cash flowdebt to less than  the acquisition of linpac is positive for klöckners business profile as will add diversification through an extended geographic reach and breadth of product offering as well as broadening the combined customer base with complementary products such as plastic trays and film lids the company will be able to offer some customers in the food sector a onestopshop for packaging solutions the larger business will also benefit from a more balanced mix of raw material inputs and some expected procurement gains the acquisition will create a larger group with around eur billion of pro forma sales and with it increased benefits of scale moodys expects adjusted leverage to reduce driven mainly by increasing ebitda from synergies generated by the acquisition of linpac which the company expects to total eur million per annum the cost reductions will come from footprint optimization overhead reductions and procurement savings which will support margin improvements in addition the company expects to expand sales of linpacs products into the us through klöckners existing infrastructure and grow sales to eastern europe through linpacs stronger customer base growth is also expected to come from positive trading performance driven by increasing volumes from klöckners recently opened additional pet production line in thailand and launch of several new medical device and pharmaceutical packaging grades for the asian market liquidity moodys views klöckners liquidity as adequate being supported by approximately eur million in cash reserves retained on balance sheet after the transaction in addition to at least eur million of undrawn revolving credit facility rcf due in  moodys expects liquidity to be supported by improving cash flow generation which will adequately cover both maintenance and investment capex requirements there will be no financial covenants on the term loan b and a senior secured leverage ratio test on the rcf when it is drawn more than  rationale for the stable outlook the outlook on all ratings is stable it reflects moodys expectation that the solid market positions and high share of sales towards nondiscretionary pharmaceutical and food end markets will continue to support the groups operating performance it also incorporates moodys assumption that the company will not embark on any further large debtfinanced acquisitions or shareholder distributions prior to deleveraging the business over the next  months what could change the rating updown the rating could be upgraded if klöckner manages to reduce adjusted leverage to sustainably below x combined with free cash flowdebt in the mid singledigits the rating may come under downward pressure if trading performance deteriorates or klöckner fails to improve its credit metrics or due to weakening liquidity principal methodology the principal methodology used in these ratings was packaging manufacturers metal glass

and markets in which we operate are highly competitive competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on quality product performance and characteristics service and price there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished in certain markets since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership our key competitors tend to focus on films based on a specific polymer either pet or pvc as well as specific endmarkets we believe that we are the global leader in the pvc market our competitors that focus on pvc include bilcare nan ya tekniplex alfatherm and perlen while the pet market is more fragmented than the pvc market over the last decade we have established ourselves as a global leader in pet applications as well key competitors in the pet market include octal and hagner we differentiate our offerings from

 skus the size and scope of our existing material science capabilities allow us to remain a leader of innovation in the industry and meet and exceed the unique requirements of our customers for highly technical applications our material science expertise relates to polyvinyl chloride “pvc” and polyethylene terephthalate “pet” which are two of the most important polymers in the rigid film industry

products through our longstanding  year history technical expertise and knowhow in developing formulations and customized products to meet customer needs our films are developed in close collaboration with our customers to meet their specific performance requirements to preserve protect or otherwise enhance the value of their products and their manufacturing productivity typically our products represent less than  of our customers’ total product cost we serve customers through four marketoriented segments pharma food  consumer packaging labels and specialties our core endmarkets have varying yet complementary growth drivers and are generally noncyclical in nature in our pharma segment we benefit from the increasing need for innovative packaging solutions the aging global population and increasing generic penetration in our labels segment the drive to enhance and differentiate the look and appearance of consumer products has led to increased demand for the more vibrant
