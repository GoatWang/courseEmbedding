the degree of involvement with the item to be purchased and the degree of involvement in the situation in which the purchasing occurs this paper reports an experiment to assess the manner in which inherent product involvement and situational task importance affect anticipated consumer purchase effort both factors were found to independently increase estimations of purchase effort but the effect of task importance was negligible in the case of high involvement products this finding is interpreted as a ceiling effect on overall involvement level the concept of consumer purchasing effort has received relatively little attention in consumer research cardozo and bramel  treated the expenditure of effort in consumer decisionmaking as a form of behavioral commitment to the purchase in this view greater effort in a consumer purchase decision increases the perceived importance of the purchase decision and thereby increases the potential for postpurchase cognitive dissonance the dissonance created by expending an amount of effort which is not commensurate with the degree of satisfaction the product is able to provide may then be reduced through an inflated postpurchase evaluation of the chosen product cardozo  and woodside  found support for this hypothesis in experiments manipulating the amount of effort required in consumers prescribed information search activities however in much of consumers normal purchasing activities the search task is much less structured and the relationship between decision importance and purchasing effort may be in the opposite direction from the one set up in these studies that is rather than greater search effort causing consumers to perceive a purchase as being more important greater purchase importance should cause consumers to expend more search effort this was the primary hypothesis motivating the present research product involvement and task involvement as determinants of decision importance two separate aspects of the importance of a purchase decision are the amount of product involvement and the nature of the task definition involved in the purchase product involvement as used here is purchase itemspecific but not purchase situationspecific howard and sheth  used the term importance of purchase lastovicka  used the term issue involvement and rothchild  used the term enduring involvement to refer to this type of involvement thus for a given individual a set of products and services might he arrayed in terms of their inherent involvement while there are individual differences in levels of involvement with a given product with a relatively homogeneous population the rank orders of involvement with an array of products are expected to be reasonably constant hupfer and gardners  measures of product involvement among college students support this expectation with certain products such as automobiles being almost uniformly more involving than other products such as facial tissues ratchford and andreasen  reached similar conclusions in their examination of the perceived importance of decisions to purchase various services by new residents to a community howard and sheth  p  predicted that greater search effort will be expended for high importance products consistent with this hypothesis katona and mueller  found strong differences in consumer decision effort deliberation between products of such apparently differential involvement as sports shirts low versus major appliances high however it is not clear that product involvement was the primary difference between these products and various authors eg sherif and cantril  have suggested that clothing is highly involving it is therefore necessary to test any operationalization of product involvement and to avoid generalizing to dissimilar populations a second determinant of decision importance is task involvement belk  suggested that taskdefining features of a consumer purchase situation arise from goals relating to information gathering or product selection and from the usage situations envisioned for products which are relevant to these goals in other words the task is defined by the consumers intentions at a particular time and place the task may be highly involving either because it entails important immediate goals eg find a coat which is the least expensive brown wool coat in town or because the intended usage situation involves important goals eg find a dress to wear to the prom although task definitions for purchase situations may also differ in other respects such as their difficulty specificity and complexity the present study is concerned only with task involvement some support for the hypothesized relationship between task importance and search effort is found in a study by gr°nhaug  gr°nhaug compared the information search activities of recent buyers of tableware who bought the product either as a gift higher task involvement or for personal use lower task involvement those who had purchased the tableware as a gift were found to have considered more alternatives visited more shops sought more advice from both dealers and others and studied more brochures based on these results and prior studies of the task involvement levels of giftgiving eg belk forthcoming the present study employs the giftpersonal use dichotomy to manipulate task involvement involvement arousal and effort a key concept integrating product involvement and task involvement as well as linking them to effort expenditure is arousal in an approximate sense arousal may be seen as the level of energy released to deal with a persons present situation while product and task involvement are not the only determinants of arousal in a focused activity like product choice and purchasing they are generally dominant the general expectation then is that with greater levels of arousal created by higher product involvement task involvement or both the amount of effort devoted to information search and processing increases it should be noted however that most theorists dealing with arousal do not postulate a straight linear relationship between level of arousal and level of efficient effort expenditure for instance based on the work of hebb  berlyne  and others hansen  predicts the greatest amount of information search and deliberation at very low and moderately high levels of arousal and the lowest amount of effort expenditure on these activities at medium levels of arousal despite the theoretical and empirical support for the nonlinear relationship between arousal and effort expenditure the series of experiments conducted by hansen  supports the view that most consumer purchase activities fall within the range of arousal which avoids the extremes at which arousal may no longer be positively associated with effort similarly it is assumed that the levels of involvement created by the present studys product and task involvement conditions are such that there is a direct although not necessarily linear relationship between arousal and consumer purchase effort expenditure consumer purchase effort in response to arousal level may be manifested in several different ways effort is spent when the consumer internally recalls and processes information as well as when there are more overt signs of information acquisition as newman  points out external information search can also take on a number of forms and appearances the most frequently used measure of external consumer search is the number of retail stores visited prior to purchase and this is the one of the measures adopted for the current study nearly all measures of external information search involve active deliberate information search although recent extensions of the time budget diary method by venkatesan and arndt forthcoming obtain some measures of passive nondeliberate information acquisition because the present study focuses on anticipated effort expenditure its measures concern deliberate information search a second measure of consumer effort expenditure used in the current study is deliberation time exclusive of travel time by excluding travel time the measure ignores locational factors idiosyncratic to the data collection city and provides a measure of largely internal search and processing activity efforts the price a consumer expects to pay for a product constitutes a third type of measure in this study although price is not a reflection of effort expenditure directly since effort must usually be expended for the consumer to obtain money spending more money is an indirect expenditure of effort hypotheses the three basic measures of effort expenditure just noted are hypothesized to be related to the two types of involvement in the following ways  more stores will be shopped more time will be spent and more money will be spent under high task involvement conditions than under low task involvement conditions  more stores will be shopped more time will be spent and more money will be spent for high involvement products than for low involvement products  the effects of task involvement and product involvement will be additive with no interaction while each of the hypothesized effects in the first two hypotheses have been discussed there is an alternative to hypothesizing that all three types of effort expenditure will increase with involvement the alternative is to consider the three types of effort as substitutes so that an increase in one type of effort can lead to a reduction in the others for instance a consumer might rely on a higher priced product as an assurance of satisfaction and thereby reduce the necessity of additional information search however considering that the source of consumer arousal is involvement with the product or task it seems more reasonable that the consumer would be willing to spend more money and more information search effort in order to assure a more satisfactory purchase furthermore in line with the cardozo  findings the expenditure of one type of effort may itself increase the overall levels of purchase involvement and arousal which would further increase the other types of effort expenditure the third hypothesis assumes that regardless of the level of inherent product involvement giving the product as a gift high task involvement increases the overall level of arousal and causes more effort to be expended method a two by four factorial design was used task involvement was manipulated by informing subjects that the product was to be purchased for personal use or else as a gift for a good friend product involvement was operationalized by the use of four products two of the products bubble bath and a blanket were chosen to represent low involvement and two jeans and a record album were chosen to represent high involvement products these choices were based on a series of direct and indirect measures of involvement with various products conducted by lastovicka  and in pretests conducted by the authors on the same general subject pool as the current study in the pretest conducted by the authors subjects also provided estimates of a low a medium and a high level for each of the three dependent measures that is subjects in the pretest estimated a low medium and high number of stores to visit a low medium and high amount of nontravel time to spend in deciding and a low medium and high amount of money to spend for each of the products these measures were obtained for each product without reference to the task situation the mean of the medium amount was used as the central point in a scale measuring the amount of a type of effort the experimental subjects would be willing to expend in selecting each product the points on either side of these central points for each scale were selected by taking the median of the high and low amounts for each product medians were used so as not to choose points skewed by any extremely high or low values given in the pretest on each scale two additional points were added by including the categories less than the low amount and higher than the high amount through the use of these scales it was possible to make comparisons of the objective real choice levels of effort expenditure across the products even though the base levels of these effort expenditures differed across the products in an effort to measure subjective relative choice levels of effort expenditures three additional questions were employed measuring effort expenditure on sevenpoint scales labeled from very little or very few to very much or very many the same results were expected from measures of both subjective and objective effort expenditures subjects were  undergraduate female students they were randomly assigned to two treatment conditions subject to the constraints that each receive both task conditions but not receive the same product it was felt that having each subject engage a different task and a different product would minimize the problem of repeated measures effects to test for this the data were first analyzed as a two by four by two design with the third factor being whether the responses were to the first producttask or the second producttask there were no significant main effects or interaction effects involving this third factor so it was felt that there had been no sensitization problem and the data were collapsed into the two by four design results the results of the study are summarized in table  and figure  the main effect for task involvement was significant for all six dependent measures with effort expenditures for gifts reported as higher than expenditures for products for personal use the second hypothesis was also generally supported with all relative choice effort measures significant but with numbers of stores the only significant real choice measure at least on the perceived effort scales then the amount of effort was greater for the high involvement products table  anova summary f levels figure  cell means of dependent variables the third hypothesis that there would be no interaction effect between task involvement and product involvement however must be rejected for all of the real choice measures and for the relative choice measure for time expenditure the interaction effect is significant as may be seen in the plots of cell means and in the simple main effects tests the effect of task involvement was to increase the amount of anticipated effort for the low involvement products but not for the high involvement products with the partial exception of the amount of money and number of stores for the record album discussion the one surprising finding is the interaction effect between inherent product involvement and task involvement although the stipulation that a product is being selected as a gift generally increases the reported amount of consumer effort expenditure this is not the case for the high involvement products the most plausible explanation is that there is a ceiling effect on the overall amount of involvement for selection of a product like jeans involvement is already as high as it can normally get and the gift conditions can raise this level no higher on the other hand giftgiving is able to transform an otherwise low involvement purchase like bubble bath into an important decision however the possible existence of a ceiling effect on involvement need not mean that there is a comparable ceiling effect on the levels of arousal corresponding to this involvement it is reasonably clear that even giving high involvement products like jeans or records as a gift is still not sufficient to create arousal at the extremely high levels for which decreased purchase effort is predicted another way to view the combined effects of the levels of product involvement and task involvement studied is in terms of product relevance to the purchasers self concept compared to the two low involvement products bubble bath and blankets the two high involvement products record albums and jeans are relatively visible to others and also more likely to be construed as matters of taste however as has been noted by belk  normally nonvisible products tend to become visible symbolic communications when they are given as gifts a part of this symbolic communication involves a message about the recipient ie this is a gift that suits you and a part of the communication involves a message about the giver ie this is a gift that reflects my tastes although the addition of the message about the recipient might seem to justify greater effort expenditure for the inherently high involvement products the fact that the normal level of effort expenditure for these products is already high enough to consider the symbolic aspects of the purchase may mitigate this effect there are some obvious cautions which need to be applied to interpreting and generalizing these results since these are reports of anticipated effort they are subject to social desirability and other biases and may not reflect the actual amount of effort devoted to purchases it is however encouraging to note that ryans  found greater amounts of information search time were expended when small appliances were chosen as gifts for people outside of the givers household than when they were chosen for personal use nevertheless the theoretical interpretations of these effects as due solely to task involvement are tentative given the singular manipulation of this variable the same is true of the product involvement variable since the products employed also differ in other ways such as their visibility also although the products selected were relevant and differentially involving for the college female sample they may not be so for others conclusion it appears that the reason for purchasing an item as well as the inherent involvement with the item create differences in the amount of effort a consumer is willing to exert in purchasing the product it would therefore be a mistake to assume that personally uninvolving products are purchased with little effort devoted to securing and processing information or otherwise attempting to optimize purchase selection in fact during peak holiday giftgiving periods high task involvement and attendant effort may predominate the selection of normally uninvolving products as suggested by other research eg hupfer and gardner  as well as the present research it would also be a mistake to assume that higher price is necessarily related to higher involvement and higher purchase effort even though blankets are generally mere expensive than jeans jeans are higher involvement products to which greater amounts of purchase effort are devoted among the areas for future research suggested by this study are investigations of purchase situation characteristics other than personalgift use which affect the level of task involvement and purchase effort it is also of interest to know whether different bases for product involvement eg social relevance financial relevance hedonic relevance are all able to create greater purchase effort expenditure it will also be necessary to establish these effects in actual as well as in anticipated purchase effort expenditures and the particular types of purchase effort expenditure which are favored in different types of high involvement purchase decisions might be considered finally it would be useful to know whether increases in consumer purchase effort in response to greater purchase involvement have the same effects on postpurchase processes such as dissonance reduction as when the effort increase is necessitated by unforeseen purchase conditions references russell w belk
