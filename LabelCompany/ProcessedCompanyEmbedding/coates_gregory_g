company to further commercialize our heavy motorcycles we have an exclusive sublicense from coates international with the right to sublicense and franchise to make use sell and otherwise dispose to others motorcycle engines utilizing the csrv system in the countries and their territories comprising north america central america and south america in exchange for this exclusive sublicense we issued  shares of our common stock to coates international we have an exclusive license from the coates trust george coates and gregory coates with the right to sublicense and franchise to make use sell and otherwise dispose to others motorcycle engines utilizing the csrv system in the entire world outside of north america central america and south america in exchange for this exclusive license we issued  shares of our common stock to the licensors in february  the licensors transferred these shares to the coates family voting trust traditional motorcycle engine technologies traditional motorcycles utilize poppet valves in conventional combustion engines the poppet valves protrude into the engine cylinder or combustion chamber the standard poppet valve engine uses mushroomshaped valves which are spring loaded and are opened by the force of the lobes of a camshaft which uses push rods or cam followers to open the valves and the valves have an up and down reciprocating motion to open and close the valves for intake and exhaust the valve closing is activated by a spring which returns the valve to the closed position they protrude into the combustion chamber and open approximately  millimeters to allow the fuel and air mixture into the combustion chamber after the compression and combustion strokes the exhaust valve opens and the piston expels the spent gas from the cylinder the four cycles are repeated thousands of times per minute traditional poppet valve combustion engines use many moving parts to operate the engine which includes parts such as the return springs cam shafts cam followers push rods rocker arms rocker shafts etc all of these moving parts must be constantly sprayed with engine oil for cooling and lubrication purposes all these moving parts require energy to operate wasting energy and reducing the thermal efficiency of the engine as a result the poppet valve engine does not maximize fuel efficiency or power output and emits more pollutants than engines designed with fewer moving parts  the csrv system the csrv system replaces the poppet valves including the moving parts these valves require to operate the reduced number of moving parts eliminates need for oil spray to cool and lubricate the moving parts the csrv system replaces the poppet valve and its many moving parts with two moving parts which do not require oil lubrication one set of spherical rotary valves on a shaft for inlet and another set for exhaust we believe these rotary valves consume less fuel lower emission of pollutants and increase power output and thermal efficiency heavy motorcycles or heavyweight motorcycles are those which have engine displacement of  ccs or more the abbreviation cc refers to the volume of an engines combustion cylinders in cubic centimeters motorcycle engines with engine volumes in excess of  cubic centimeters are characterized as heavy cruiser motorcycles over the past  years coates international has devoted substantial time and financial resources to the research development design and construction of the csrv system the csrv system differs from the conventional poppet valve system currently used in almost all piston driven automotive motorcycle and marine engines by changing the method by which the air and fuel mixture is delivered to the engine cylinder as well as the method of expelling the exhaust gases after the mixture is ignited unlike the poppet valve which protrudes into the engine cylinder the csrv system utilizes spherical valves which do not protrude into the cylinder but rotate in a cavity formed between a two piece cylinder head as a result of employing fewer moving parts as compared to the poppet valve and not protruding into the engine cylinder we believe that the csrv system will promote less engine wear and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine in addition because the csrv system does not employ parts which protrude into the engine cylinder it is designed with larger openings into the cylinder than conventional poppet valves so that more fuel and air mixture can be inducted into and expelled from the engine cylinder in a shorter period of time using the csrv system leading to an ability to operate the engine faster and an ability to utilize higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures we believe that as a result engines modified with the csrv system will produce more power than similar engines utilizing the poppet valve system the csrv system operates on ceramic carbon bearings and seals the seals and sealing mechanism being activated by variations in combustion chamber pressure this results in less friction in the engine generating greater output with less wear on the engine epa testing and certification we have completed the design phase of our initial line of heavy cruiser motorcycles and are now preparing for manufacturing and distribution an essential step and integral part of this process is the testing of our motorcycles for drivability durability and compliance with all  states and epa standards and limits for exhaust emissions the tests must be performed at an independent test facility recognized by the epa we have begun the required testing and expect to complete the testing protocol to determine if our motorcycles comply with the applicable  and then the  through  epa emissions and durability standards in the event our motorcycle passes these tests we would be permitted to begin our motorcycle sales and distribution program as a small volume manufacturer of motorcycles and motorcycle engines on may   the epa approved a reduced  kilometer durability testing protocol instead of the standard  kilometer testing protocol for our  motorcycles in the event we successfully pass the  epa emissions and durability standards we would be able to begin marketing our  model heavy cruiser motorcycles in  market opportunity during each year of the period  through  sales of heavy motorcycles in the united states have increased we hope to be a participant in the worldwide market for motorcycles which the fredonia group report estimates was over  billion in sales for more than  million vehicles in calendar year  the fredonia group report estimates this market to grow to over  billion us and increase to almost  million vehicles by  the motorcycle industry is currently undergoing a technology transition driven by a confluence of factors the strongest of these is related to exhaust emissions regulation it includes the phaseout of two stroke engines and significantly more stringent emission standards which we believe provides us with a vast potential market for our products and large revenue streams for licenses and royalties for our motorcycle engines with our advanced spherical rotary valve technology  our product the coates heavy cruiser model motorcycle we intend to initially construct a heavy cruiser motorcycle with a vtwin csrv system design four stroke air cooled  ccs engine equipped with disc brakes and incorporating the csrv system we believe that our new heavy cruiser motorcycle utilizing the csrv system in its engine will be able to compete with other similar heavy motorcycles currently available in the market our heavy cruiser motorcycle equipped with a new engine utilizing the csrv system has the potential to produce high performance fuel efficiency and durability we have completed the construction of three prototype heavy cruiser motorcycles utilizing the csrv system in june  our first motorcycle underwent an initial tailpipe emissions test at compliance and research services inc cr testing a motor vehicle testing facility located in plainfield  new jersey in may  our motorcycle began a continuous emissions testing protocol at cr testing our motorcycle must successfully pass the  applicable epa emissions standards based upon preliminary testing results cr testing obtained approval from the epa to reduced testing for our  motorcycle resulting in the reduction of the testing cycle from  kilometers to  kilometers with full durability testing for our  models to continue once the  kilometer benchmark is achieved we anticipate that our motorcycles will continue further testing in order to comply with these applicable emissions regulations we have purchased parts and equipment to construct another  motorcycles we plan to assemble and then test each of these motorcycles in the next several months following the successful completion of applicable emissions testing and the certification of our motorcycle components meeting applicable safety regulations we plan to sell these  motorcycles to customers who have already placed orders and in some cases placed a cash deposit with us for the purchase of our motorcycles we currently have received  orders from customers to purchase our motorcycles our strategy we believe that our heavy cruiser motorcycle will successfully compete with other motorcycle products in the domestic market we initially intend to manufacture and assemble one motorcycle product our heavy cruiser motorcycle with a  ccs engine utilizing the csrv system our business plan is comprised of four operational and marketing goals o we plan to manufacture assemble and sell our heavy cruiser motorcycle to customers from our new jersey facility focusing on customers located in the eastern united states o we intend to offer sublicenses for our motorcycle including our engine design and the csrv system adapted to this application to original equipment manufacturers o we intend to establish a marketing program by establishing relationships with existing dealerships to sell our heavy cruiser motorcycle engines incorporating the csrv system in the road and racing market as well as in the retrofit aftermarket sales and marketing strategy we intend to market our heavy cruiser motorcycle product by direct advertising in the print media primarily magazines and newspapers devoted to the motorcycle customer we have not performed any marketing studies to assess the potential marketability of our heavy cruiser motorcycle product and do not intend to do so we believe that because of its special features including its design and utilization of the csrv system our heavy cruiser motorcycle will be attractive to customers nationwide however we can give investors no assurances that we can attract customers with our new product and its features we expect the retail price for our heavy cruiser motorcycle to be slightly higher than other heavy motorcycles in the price range between  to   we estimate that the costs to produce approximately  heavy cruiser motorcycle products including the costs for manufacture parts and labor assembly will be approximately  per motorcycle accordingly we believe that we can manufacture assemble and sell approximately  of our new heavy cruiser motorcycles with approximately  million of the net proceeds received from the sale of the minimum  units this offering within twelve months from funding  strategic agreements sublicense agreement in a sublicense agreement entered into on april   as amended on march   we received an exclusive sublicense from coates international ltd with the right to sublicense and franchise to make use and sell our motorcycle engines utilizing the csrv system in the countries and their territories comprising north america central america and south america we also received a nonexclusive license to use csrv valve seals solely for the manufacture of the csrv system for incorporation into motorcycle engines throughout the same territory coates international holds an exclusive license from george j coates and his son gregory g coates to manufacture sell and grant sublicenses with respect to products based on the coates patents including those sublicensed to us in north america central america and south america the duration of the sublicense agreement is until the expiration of the last to expire patent that is licensed unless the agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its termination provisions early termination by coates international ltd could occur if we commit a material breach of any provision of the sublicense agreement and the breach is not cured within thirty days or if we enter bankruptcy become insolvent or any similar event occurs to us in exchange for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement we issued  shares of our common stock to coates international representing more than  of our outstanding shares also under this sublicense agreement we are obligated to pay coates international a royalty of  per each  cc for each csrv system motorcycle engine sold by us in the relevant territory we also agreed to obligate all our sublicensees to whom we sublicense the csrv system patents and technology under this sublicense agreement to pay coates international a royalty of  per each  cc for each motorcycle engine they manufacture we also agreed to utilize our best efforts to register  shares in this prospectus on behalf of coates international to accommodate the distribution of these shares to the shareholders of coates international as a stock dividend license agreement in a license agreement entered into on april   as amended on march   we received an exclusive license from the coates trust george j coates and gregory g coates with the right to sublicense and franchise to make use sell and otherwise dispose to others motorcycle engines utilizing the csrv system in all the countries of the world except those in north america central america and south america we also received a nonexclusive license to use csrv valve seals solely for the manufacture of the csrv system for incorporation into motorcycle engines throughout the same territory the duration of the license agreement is until the expiration of the last to expire patent that is licensed unless the agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its termination provisions early termination by the licensors could occur if we commit a material breach of any provision of the sublicense agreement and the breach is not cured within thirty days or if we enter bankruptcy become insolvent or any similar event occurs to us in exchange for this exclusive license we issued to george j coates gregory g coates and the coates family trust an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in february  all of these shares were transferred to the coates family voting trust under the control of an independent and unrelated trustee also under this license agreement we are obligated to pay the licensors a royalty of  per each  cc for each csrv system motorcycle engine sold by us in the relevant territory we also agreed to obligate all our sublicensees to whom we sublicense the csrv system patents and technology under this license agreement to pay the licensors a royalty of  per each  cc for each motorcycle engine they manufacture  competition the motorcycle industry council estimates the united states market for heavy motorcycles during  was dominated by harleydavidson approximately  honda approximately  suzuki approximately  with bmw kawasaki yamaha and others controlling the rest of this marketplace all of our potential competitors have wellestablished and long operating histories substantially greater financial technical sales marketing and other resources as well as greater name recognition and an established customer base as a result these competitors will be able to devote much greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their motorcycle products than we will be able to devote competitors with an established customer base will have a competitive advantage over us when selling their heavy motorcycle products to such customers intellectual property our sublicense and license provide us with the right to utilize all existing patents and future enhancements whether patentable or not covering the csrv system until the expiration of the last to expire patent unless the sublicense andor license are terminated earlier according to their terms our goal is to have our licensors and sublicensors obtain maintain and enforce patent protection for our products formulations processes methods and other proprietary technologies it is also our goal to preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties both in the united states and in other countries our policy is to actively seek to have our licensors and sublicensors obtain where appropriate the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents both in the united states and elsewhere in the world we currently have licenses or sublicenses to  us patents and a number of foreign counterpart patents and patent applications we have licensed these us patents and their foreign counterparts from coates international with respect to north america south america and central america and from the coates trust george coates and gregory coates with respect to the rest of the world the term of a patent is typically  years from filing date subject to any statutory extension if any application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications the term of the patent is  years from the date on which the earliest application was filed subject to any statutory extension in the united states for applications filed prior to june   the term of a patent is the longer of  years from the date of grant of the patent and  years from the earliest effective us filing date of the application because the time from filing to issuance of engineering patent applications often takes several years patent protection if any on patented engineering technologies such as our products may be substantially less than the  year or  years periods referenced above we also depend upon the skills knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel as well as that of our advisors consultants and other contractors none of which is patentable to help protect our proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests to this end we require all employees consultants advisors and certain other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and where applicable require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas developments discoveries and inventions important to our business additionally these confidentiality agreements require that our employees consultants and advisors do not bring to us or use without proper authorization any third partys proprietary technology government regulations our motorcycle engine utilizing the csrv system will be subject to extensive environmental laws rules and regulations that impose standards for emissions and safety in order for our heavy cruiser motorcycle product to be sold in the united states it must meet certain emissions regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency or epa in addition certain parts of our motorcycle designated as the safety components such as brake hoses the brake system tires and lights must be individually certified as in compliance with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and regulations to the united states national highway transportation and safety administration or dot  the epa is charged with overseeing compliance with applicable emissions standards we must submit an application to the epa certifying that our motorcycle engine is in compliance with applicable emissions standards the independent firm of compliance and research services inc of plainfield  new jersey cr testing will test our motorcycle to establish that its emissions are in compliance with the applicable emission threshold standards for the year of production as well as during the useful life of the motorcycle as per federal regulations the useful life of motorcycles having an engine of  ccs or larger is  kilometers the  kilometer standard means that generally the epa permits an engines emissions and durability testing to actually endure for only  kilometers and the results achieved at this point are permitted to be extrapolated out to the  kilometer limit we have commenced the testing of our prototype motorcycles at cr testing in june  our motorcycle underwent initial emissions testing and achieved positive results in may  our motorcycles began a regular and continuous testing protocol at cr testing based upon these tests of our motorcycle cr testing applied to the epa for a reduced testing protocol for our  motorcycle products which was approved by the epa in may  as a result our motorcycles will be tested to determine compliance with the  epa emissions and durability standards over a reduced protocol of  kilometers instead of the customary  kilometer requirement beginning in  and continuing through  our heavy cruiser motorcycles will be required to achieve more stringent emissions standards these emissions standards include the normal protocol that includes four durability tests run over the  kilometers standard we expect cr testing to complete the emission tests on our prototype motorcycles during the third or fourth quarter of  assuming our motorcycle engine meets these epa emission standards cr testing will submit our application for us to the epa also during the third or fourth quarter of  for certification that we are in compliance with these emission standards the epa will review our application for certification make comments ask questions and upon full review either approve or deny our application for certification based upon our initial test results described above we believe that emissions from our prototype motorcycle engines will comply with the    epa standards however we cannot assure investors that such clearance will be obtained with the exception of the state of california the motor vehicle emissions standards of the remaining  states conform to the epa emission standards following successful testing and compliance with epa emission standards we intend to test our motorcycle engine under the applicable emission standards rules and regulations of the state of california the state of california in addition to its more strict emission standards will subject our motorcycle to additional evaporative emission standards and durability requirements the dot is responsible for overseeing the safety of motor vehicles including motorcycles we must certify to the dot that all of our motorcycles safety components comply with applicable federal safety standards since all of the components of our motorcycle are currently available on the open market they have been previously certified by the dot we estimate that the cost and expense to complete the required emissions testing under the  and the new  through  epa standards and dot certifications will be approximately   facilities we are currently utilizing several offices and approximately  square feet of assembly space at the

considered in addition to the other information contained in this prospectus in evaluating coates motorcycle company ltd its financial condition and its business prospects business and financial condition risk factors risk of investment loss an investment in the common shares of coates motorcycle company ltd is highly speculative and may result in the loss of an investors entire investment only potential investors who are experienced investors in high risk investments and who can afford to lose their entire investment should consider an investment in this offering limited operating history the company was incorporated in march  and has only commenced business operations since march of  accordingly the company has no operating history upon which investors may evaluate its business plan and prospects the companys plan to manufacture and sell heavy cruiser motorcycles utilizing the coates csrv system will depend upon the success of this offering moreover the company expects to incur losses and negative cash flow from its startup operations for the foreseeable future with the expectation that such losses will increase as our operations develop there can be no assurance that the companys heavy cruiser motorcycle will pass acceptable performance and durability tests pass state and federal emissions tests be constructed and assembled on a scheduled basis or be successfully marketed and sold or that the company will achieve andor maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods the companys prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their startup phase of development to address these risks among other things the company must   test its motorcycles for durability and emissions   implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy   continue to develop and upgrade its motorcycle products   provide superior customer service and order fulfillment   respond to competitive developments and   attract retain and motivate qualified personnel there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations future capital needs uncertainty of additional funding the company requires substantial working capital to fund its business plan the company is expected to experience negative cash flow from operations from inception of its business and expects to continue to experience significant negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future the companys capital requirements depend on several factors including the mechanical success of the csrv system adapted to its heavy cruiser motorcycle engines the achievement of successful performance durability and emission testing results the uncertainty of market acceptance the ability to produce and assemble sufficient numbers of motorcycles to achieve commercial acceptance as well as maintaining a retail operation to achieve sales and marketing and other factors if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned the company may require additional financing sooner than anticipated if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the company will be reduced stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the companys common shares there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the company or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms the company may be unable to develop or enhance its motorcycle product take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition or operating results dependence on suppliers the motorcycle parts and engines supplier currently being targeted by the company to supply its engine blocks and parts are single sources at present singlesourced components include frames gas tanks and engines any interruption in the supply of any of these components or the inability of the company to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time could result in higher projected prices for the companys motorcycle products and could have a material adverse effect upon the companys business operating results and financial condition qualifying additional suppliers is time consuming and expensive there can be no assurance that such shortages will not occur in the future and any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations product liability risk the companys heavy cruiser motorcycles are intended to be high performance units as a result they will be subject to stresses which may increase the product liability risks of the company purchasers of the companys heavy motorcycles will rely on the integrity and durability of our motorcycles however there can be no assurance that the companys heavy cruiser motorcycles will perform as expected or function as intended accordingly there can be no assurance that the company will not incur liabilities in connection with its motorcycles for product liability claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations competition the highperformance motorcycle domestic market is intensely competitive currently dominated by harley davidson in addition expected competition in the heavy motorcycle market will also come from such recognizable brands as honda suzuki kawasaki and yamaha we believe that our motorcycles will be able to enter the domestic market and successfully compete with these well known motorcycle products the us motorcycle market is characterized by frequent introductions of new or enhanced motorcycles price competition continued emergence of new industry standards and regulatory developments all of the companys potential competitors have wellestablished and long operating histories substantially greater financial technical sales marketing and other resources as well as greater name recognition and an established customer base as a result these competitors will be able to devote much greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their motorcycle products than the company competitors with an established customer base will have a competitive advantage over the company when selling their heavy motorcycle products to such customers although we believe that our heavy cruiser motorcycle will be competitive all of the companys potential competitors domestic and foreign have significantly greater financial production distribution and marketing resources than we do regulation federal state and local authorities have various environmental control requirements relating to air water and noise pollution that will impact our business and operations we will endeavor to ensure that our facilities and motorcycle products will comply with all applicable environmental regulations and standards our motorcycles will be subject to certification by the us environmental protection agency epa for compliance with applicable emissions and noise standards and if sold in california they will be subject to the state of california air resources board carb and its more stringent emissions standards in addition to the us emission standards are becoming universally more rigorous and will require a continuing level of research and development and production costs related to motorcycle emissions and noise for the foreseeable future as an anticipated manufacturer of motorcycle products we will be subject to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act which is administered by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa we will have to certify to nhtsa that our motorcycle products comply fully with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and related regulations we can give no assurances to investors that our motorcycles will comply with any of these environmental and safety laws rules and regulations in which case such failures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and plan of operations startup research and development company until our heavy motorcycles have been fully tested for performance durability and emissions and until we are able to manufacture assemble and sell our heavy cruiser motorcycle product in quantities sufficient to produce earnings we are now and will continue to be primarily a development stage startup company as an expected result we will incur operating losses throughout the foreseeable future in addition we expect to have minimal revenues during this period and expect to incur a substantial accumulated deficit lack of prior manufacturing experience we have no motorcycle manufacturing assembling or selling experience accordingly we can give no assurances that we will be successful in manufacturing assembling and selling a heavy cruiser motorcycle product on a cost effective basis no dividends anticipated capital requirements make it highly unlikely that any dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock now or in the foreseeable future management risk factors dependence on gregory g coates and george j coates the successful development of our heavy motorcycle business including its production assembly marketing and selling operations will initially be dependent upon gregory g coates and george j coates accordingly the loss of the availability or services of either gregory g coates or george j coates whether due to death incapacity or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations see management ownership of our company our company has been capitalized as a subsidiary of our parent coates international ltd our parent will at all times own approximately  of our equity ownership represented by our initial issuance to it of  shares of our stock which ownership percentage is protected from dilution by an antidilution right we gave our parent these shares and the antidilution right as consideration for our parents granting us an exclusive sublicense covering its patent and technology rights over the coates spherical rotary valve in the western hemisphere see sublicense we also issued  initial shares to the coates family in exchange for their grant to us of a nonexclusive license covering their patent and technology rights over the coates spherical rotary valve in the rest of the world see license although these  shares initially represent approximately of our equity their ownership position is subject to dilution as a result of this offering and in cases of future issuances of our stock for proper corporate purposes for example the successful sale of  of the  shares in this offering will trigger an automatic increase in our parents equity ownership position from its current  shares to  of our shares this automatic increase of  shares is required pursuant to the antidilution right we granted to our parent in the sublicense this antidilution right guarantees that our parent will own approximately  of our equity ownership as long as we remain in existence on the other hand the  shares issued to the coates family comprised of george j coates gregory g coates and the coates trust in exchange for the nonexclusive license are not protected by an antidilution right like the one we granted to our parent accordingly the successful sale of  of the  shares in this offering will reduce the coates familys aggregate equity ownership in our company from approximately  to approximately  and in the event we sell all of the  shares in this offering to approximately   see dilution the consideration or payment we made to the coates family represented by our issuance to its members of  shares of our stock and to our parent represented by the issuance to it of  shares of our stock with the antidilution right were arbitrarily determined by our parents management the decision concerning the amount of these payments represented by the issuance of these amounts of our shares and in the case of the parent the antidilution right was not based upon any arms length negotiations or any other recognizable criterion of value conflicts of interest gregory g coates and george j coates the success of our offering our current and future business operations and plans our ability to obtain future financing as well as our current and future financial condition may be adversely and materially affected by certain conflicts of interest assumed by gregory g coates and george j coates which include but are not limited to the following services to be rendered gregory g coates and george j coates are currently employed by our parent coates international ltd although gregory g coates our president will devote his fulltime to our business and its development he may be called upon to render services from time to time to our parent george j coates our chief executive officer and a director also serves as the president and chief executive officer of our parent coates international ltd as our chief executive officer mr coates shall devote as much of his time as is necessary to our management and operations mr george j coates shall not be be paid for the services he renders to us while he serves as our chief executive officer gregory g coates will be paid by us for his services the amount of which compensation will depend upon such factors as the success of this offering the success of our production marketing and the volume of our motorcycle sales neither gregory g coates nor geoge j coates currently have employment agreements with our parent nor with us and we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with either of them in the forseeable future both messrs coates therefore will be rendering services to us and to our parent which represent direct conflicts of interest accordingly investors should be aware that gregory g coates due to his occasional ongoing commitments to our parent and george j coates due to his current commitments to our parent may not be in a position to render to us the amount of time and services we will require to develop and operate a successful business control of equity ownership george j coates owns approximately  and his son gregory g coates owns an approximate  respectively of the ownership equity of our parent coates international ltd their combined holdings represent an approximate aggregate  equity ownership position in our parent conjunctively our parent due to the antidilution right we gave it currently and throughout our corporate existence will continue to own in excess of  of our ownership equity interests accordingly the coates family by virtue of its control position in our parent will be able to control our management and business operations including but not limited to appointing all of the members of our board of directors and all of our officers for the foreseeable future as long as they remain controlling shareholders of our parent offering risk factors arbitrary

international ltd to manufacture and sell heavy cruiser motorcycles with engines equipped with the coates spherical rotary valve and other proprietary enhancements created and owned by coates international ltd george j coates and gregory g coates the csrv system our company intends to manufacture construct and sell heavy cruiser motorcycles the exclusive sublicense we received an exclusive sublicense from coates international ltd to make use and sell motorcycles utilizing the csrv system in the countries and their territories comprising north america central america and south america collectively the western hemisphere in exchange for this exclusive sublicense we issued more than  of our ownership interests in the form of  shares of its common stock to coates international ltd

our parent holds an exclusive license from george j coates and his son gregory g coates to manufacture sell and grant sublicenses with respect to products based on the coates patents in the western

combustion engines utilizing the technology falling within the scope of the coates patents in the western hemisphere or to grant any other exclusive or nonexclusive license in the western hemisphere except through our parent as used herein the term company we our or us refers to coates motorcycle company ltd a delaware corporation the companys offices is located at highway  and ridgewood road wall township new jersey  where its telephone number is   � � � � background based upon the strength of the heavy cruiser motorcycle market in the united states and in certain other parts of the world our parent george j coates and gregory g coates decided to organize our company as a separate subsidiary within which to manufacture market and sell new heavy cruiser motorcycle incorporating the coates csrv system business plan the coates heavy cruiser model motorcycle line we believe that a new heavy cruiser motorcycle utilizing the csrv system in its engine will be able to compete with other similar heavy motorcycles currently available in the market our heavy cruiser motorcycles equipped with a new engine utilizing the coates csrv system has the potential to produce high performance fuel efficiency and durability we intend to initially construct motorcycle models with a twin csrv four stroke air cooled  cc engine equipped with disc brakes and incorporating the coates csrv system we have completed the construction of two heavy cruiser motorcycles utilizing the coates csrv system we anticipate that these motorcycles will undergo emissions and safety testing in the next several months in order to comply with applicable state and federal regulations competition the heavy motorcycle market during each year of the period  through  the heavy motorcycle market in the united states has increased dramatically heavy motorcycles or heavyweight motorcycles are those which have engine displacement of cc the united states market for heavy motorcycles is dominated by harleydavidson approximately  honda approximately  suzuki approximately  with kawasaki yamaha and others controlling the rest of this marketplace we believe that we can manufacture assemble and sell approximately  of our new heavy cruiser motorcycles with approximately between  and  of the funds received from this offering within twelve months from funding the basic design of the parts and engine has already been accomplished the only delays we anticipate are nonmaterial engine refinements and the emissions and safety testing protocols the manufacture and assembly of these targeted  motorcycles will not be delayed since we have already negotiated costs and expenses with the suppliers for all of the parts including engine blocks and frames because of the special features including its design and utilization of the coates csrv system we expect the retail price for our heavy cruiser motorcycle to be slightly higher than other heavy motorcycles in the price range of between  to  assuming we are successful in selling the entire  common shares in this offering receiving gross offering proceeds of  we expect to manufacture assemble and sell approximately between  and  heavy cruiser motorcycles within  months from funding of course this schedule is subject to unforeseeable events and delays due to testing protocols based upon our conservative estimates of overhead costs we anticipate a net profit before taxes of approximately  of the retail price we expect that our capital requirements will increase depending upon the success of our offering sometime commencing  months following completion of this offering the manufacture and assembly of heavy motorcycles is a capital intensive business that will require the company to secure warehousing facilities for its inventory a new location for its management and assembly operation in anticipation of the successful completion of this offering we are searching and investigating available properties for our future use we expect to utilize the facilities of our parent coates international ltd in wall new jersey for our executive offices inventory storage and assembly operations we will pay our parent monthly rent of  for the use of its current offices and facilities the coates csrv system the coates csrv system differs from the conventional poppet valve system currently used in almost all piston driven automotive motorcycle and marine engines by changing the method by which the air and fuel mixture is delivered to the engine cylinder as well as the method of expelling the exhaust gases after the mixture is ignited unlike the poppet valve which protrudes into the engine cylinder the coates csrv system utilizes spherical valves which do not protrude into the cylinder but rotate in a cavity formed between a two piece cylinder head as a result of employing fewer moving parts as compared to the poppet valve and not protruding into the engine cylinder management believes that the coates csrv system will promote less engine wear and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine in addition because the coates csrv system does not employ parts which protrude into the engine cylinder it is designed with larger openings into the cylinder than conventional poppet valves so that more fuel and air mixture can be inducted into and expelled from the engine cylinder in a shorter period of time using the coates csrv system leading to an ability to operate the engine faster and an ability to utilize higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures management believes that as a result engines modified with the coates csrv system will produce more power than similar engines utilizing the poppet valve system the coates csrv system operates on ceramic carbon bearings and seals the seals and sealing mechanism being activated by variations in combustion chamber pressure as a result of employing fewer moving parts as compared to the poppet valve and not protruding into the engine cylinder management believes that the coates csrv system will promote less engine wear and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine in addition because the coates csrv system does not employ parts which protrude into the engine cylinder it is designed with larger openings into the cylinder than conventional poppet valves so that more fuel and air mixture can be inducted into and expelled from the engine cylinder in a shorter period of time using the coates csrv systems leading to an ability to operate the engine faster and an ability to utilize higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures patents and licenses coates international ltd we have received an exclusive sublicense from our parent coates international ltd we have also signed an agreement and received a nonexclusive license from george j coates gregory g coates and their family trust these agreements effectively give us the ability to exclusively manufacture assemble and sell our motorcycle products in the western hemisphere we have the nonexclusive right to use not manufacture and sell our motorcycle products in all other parts of the world the sublicense and the license give us the right to utilize all existing patents and future enhancements whether patentable or not covering the coates csrv system for the duration of the legal life of these patents generally  years a brief history of the patents we are entitled to use shows the early development of this extraordinary technology in  george j coates obtained a patent from the
