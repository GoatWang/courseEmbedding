the all cap portfolios we manage small cap growth small cap growth the small cap category is one of our most fruitful hunting grounds since the core of our investment strategy is developing an information edge through exhaustive research legwork in general smaller companies are not as widely followed as companies higher up the marketcap ladder that means gathering grassroots insights about

operational performance our portfolio management style is consistent with that individualcompany focus the goal is to outperform the indexes not mimic them collections of our best ideas existing

macro forces can move “the market” for fleeting periods each company influences the longterm direction of its share price through operational execution companies that top expectations attract positive attention as growth investors we view earnings growth as the ultimate sign of a company’s success we believe companies with earnings power that the broader investment community underestimates offer the best potential for share price appreciation exhaustive research legwork isolates companies with the most potential to positively surprise we believe the best way to gain insight into individualcompany earnings trends is to stay connected to the front lines of the economy through ongoing interviews with management teams customers competitors and suppliers exhaustive research is our firm’s central focus each company earns its space in the portfolio by showing greater promise than an existing holding consistent with our individualcompany focus a portfolio position is prime space only available to a company with a better fundamental profile than an existing holding portfolio construction is a function of our continuous search for individualcompany earnings strength valuation
