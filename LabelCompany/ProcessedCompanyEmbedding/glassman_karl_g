good morning and thank you for participating in our first quarter call we are pleased with our start to  sales growth improved as the quarter progressed and earnings were slightly ahead of our forecast for the full year we expect market improvement and leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and strong earnings as we reported yesterday first quarter sales increased  to  million despite a  reduction from prior year divestitures organic sales grew  primarily from continued strength in automotive acquisitions also added  to sales growth first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were  down slightly from  in the first quarter last year the benefit from higher volume and a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by higher steel costs and several smaller factors steel costs began to inflate in late  and we have implemented price increases to recover the higher costs with our typical pricing lag earnings and margins were compressed in the first quarter as expected but should improve over the remainder of the year we completed two acquisitions during the quarter that should add combined annual revenue of approximately  million the first is a distributor and installer of geosynthetic products and expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our geo components business the second is a manufacture of surfacecritical bent tube components supporting the privatelabel finished seating strategy in our work furniture business on april  we filed an k discussing changes to our management structure and our segments that were effective january  under the new segment structure the home furnishings group was move from residential products to furniture products and the machinery group was moved from specialized products to residential products in addition lifo impact will now be recognized within the segment to which it resides we revised prior year data for comparison purposes in the residential product segment first quarter total sales were flat with a  decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions volume grew  with demand improving late in the quarter however this growth was offset by lower passthrough sales of adjustable beds which reduced segment sales by  we will begin to anniversary this headwind in the third quarter us spring component dollar sales were flat with  growth in comfortcore units and other content gains offsetting declines in total unit volume total innerspring units decreased  and box spring unit volume was down  in the quarter international spring sales were strong with dollars up  machinery sales decreased significantly offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment segment ebit increased and ebit margin improved primarily due to the absence of last year’s fifo inventory impact and a favorable sales mix in the current quarter in the first quarter last year ebit was negatively impacted as we reduced selling prices while we were still consuming higher cost inventory in the industrial product segment first quarter total sales decreased  largely from divestitures completed during  organic sales were down  with lower volume partially offset by steelrelated price increases the segment’s ebit and ebit margin decreased due to the lag associated with recovering higher steel costs and lower volume in both rod and wire in the furniture product segment first quarter sales were essentially flat adjustable bed sales grew  and work furniture sales also increased but these improvements were offset by lower sales in fashion bed and home furniture segment ebit and ebit margin decreased primarily from steel inflation cost associated with new program launches and the nonreoccurrence of a prior year gain from a building sale of  million in the specialized product segment first quarter organic sales increased  with continued strength in automotive and improvements in aerospace partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in cvp the prior year divestiture offset part of the organic sales growth excluding currency changes automotive sales grew  and aerospace organic sales increased  in the quarter the segment’s ebit was essentially flat and ebit margin decreased with the benefit from higher volume offset by cost associated with growth in automotive absence of earnings from a prior year divestiture and other smaller items i’ll now turn the call over to matt matthew c flanigan thanks karl and good morning everyone cash from operations was  million in the first quarter a decrease of  million versus the first quarter last year primarily due to increased working capital this increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth and new programs increased accounts receivable from strengthening sales late in the quarter and the inflation impact on both inventory and receivables we ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at  in line with the first quarter of last year we continue to expect our full year operating cash to exceed  million in february we declared a quarterly dividend of  per share and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to  years the dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of  to  therefore we expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth at yesterday’s closing price of  the current yield is  which is one of the higher yields among the  companies that comprise the sp  dividend aristocrats we repurchased  million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of  and issued  million shares largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises as you may recall for the past few years we have typically bought more shares of our stock in the first quarter than in each of the other three quarters of the year for all of  we now expect to repurchase a total of  million to  million shares and issue about  million primarily for employee benefit plans our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions we ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of  at the high end of our longstanding targeted range of  to  reflecting working capital investment are typically strong first quarter stock repurchases and increased acquisition activity we also monitor debt to ebitda and ended the quarter with debt at  times our trailing  months adjusted ebitda we access our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling threeyear basis our target is to achieve tsr in the top onethird of the sp  over the long term which we believe will require an average tsr of  to  per year for the threeyear period that will end on december   we have so far generated compound annual tsr of  per year and that performance currently places us within the top  of the sp  our guidance for  is unchanged full year sales are anticipated to be  billion to  billion up  to  versus  we expect midsingle digit volume growth from strength in automotive bedding adjustable bed work furniture and geo components raw materialrelated price increases should also add to sales growth the sales impact from divestitures completed during  should be offset by acquisitions we expect full year earnings per share of  to  versus adjusted eps of  in  this guidance assumes that the benefit from higher volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we experienced in recovering higher raw material costs most of which occurred in the first quarter based upon this guidance range we anticipate a  ebit margin between  and  as previously mentioned operating cash flow should exceed  million in  with both working capital investments supporting sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash capital expenditures should approximate  million and dividend should require about  million of cash for the year our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth dividends and strategic acquisitions after funding these priorities if there is still cash available we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to  million shares each year however no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established with those comments i’ll now turn the call back over to dave desonier david m desonier that concludes our prepared remarks we thank you for your attention and we will be glad to answer your questions in order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant if you have additional questions you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well rob we are ready to begin the qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of robert majek with cjs please go ahead with your question robert majek good morning susan r mccoy hi robert robert majek given the recent steel price increases over the past few months which should prove accretive to margins and earnings for the year and perhaps incrementally positive to guidance which has been left unchanged it is just conservatism or are there other offsetting factors we should be thinking about susan r mccoy robert you need to bear in mind that we do have a lag when costs go up it typically takes us a quarter or so to have our pricing adjusted in order to recover the increase in costs so that’s part of the consideration but the sales growth we factored in and the early kind of start to the year impact from steel was about what we would have anticipated that it would have been so we think everything has been appropriately allowed for robert majek thank you and just one quick follow up from me pretty solid growth in automotive can you just kind of help us understand the drivers there and perhaps your view on the growth rate going forward given what some see as a potential plateau in industry auto sales j mitchell dolloff sure this is mitch dolloff we continue to be very optimistic about our opportunities in automotive we have said that we expect to grow that business  points stronger than the market overall and remember this is truly a global business for us so while we have significant operations in north america we also have operations throughout europe and the developed markets in asia so we really look at this as what the total market is going to do so for our major markets that growth is estimated to be about  for  so we feel good about our ability to continue to deliver the doubledigit kind of growth that we have been it’s really based on the strength of our products the strength of our relationships from a technology standpoint with our customers meaning our engagement with them early in programs and we have good visibility of those programs because we typically win them a year or two ahead of production so we remain optimistic about that business robert majek thank you i’ll hop back into queue operator our next question comes from the line of budd bugatch with raymond james please proceed with your question robert griffin good morning everybody this is bobby filling in for budd thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a good start to the year karl g glassman thank you bobby robert griffin are you guys hearing for your customers that the pickup in demand within residential that you experienced in march is it sticking or was it more just a function of the timing shift and tax refunds perry e davis hi bobby this is perry we did see a pretty good pickup after kind of a sluggish start at the beginning of the year march was a good month for us a lot of you can attribute to the tax refunds which by the way were a little bit delayed from the prior year right now in bedding the shipments in april are back under last year about midsingle digits april and october historically over the last few years are a couple of the weaker months we are seeing some positive developments though with regards to some of those introductions we saw early in the year at las vegas those are beginning to filter into the market now with four samples being placed in readiness for the upcoming memorial selling which typically is the kickoff to our busier season on the bedding side robert griffin okay and the industry should still expect at least from a bedding perspective a pretty big increase in advertising at least from how we understand it starting at memorial day do you believe that’s still the case perry e davis we do given all the turmoil in the industry over the last three months we do expect that promotion and advertising will ramp up pretty heavily i would think it would be heavier this year than in past years – for the last years remains to be seen yet and that generally bodes well for the industry overall and for us robert griffin okay and i’m going to try to sneak one more in just on the slight change in the ebit margin guidance for the full year i think the midpoint priorly was  and now it’s around  is it just more of a function of the acquisitions and some recent price movement in steel susan r mccoy it’s really just rounding bobby i wouldn’t attribute too much to it we before would have considered ish to be kind of midpoint of guidance and that’s about where we still are right now so that full range it could be a little higher than that it could be a little lower the steel headwinds obviously is an issue in the first quarter it’s unpredictable what will happen in the steel market so if costs were to continue to increase we would potentially have to deal with an additional lag at some point and we need to allow for that latitude and the range that we have out there robert griffin okay i appreciate all the detail i’ll jump back in the queue best of luck going forward operator our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust please proceed with your questions keith hughes thank you questions on overall margin you know what you said now is pricing of volume will margins in the second quarter still be down yearoveryear or would be able to sneak them up as the prices come in susan r mccoy no keith they’ll probably still be down if you remember in the second quarter last year we were still pretty strong with a bit of the sort of lag tailwind that related to the deflation that had been going on last year in the second quarter our adjusted margin was almost  so while we’d expect our margins to increase sequentially from  in the first quarter we would not anticipate that they would increase enough to surpass last year’s second quarter margins matthew c flanigan keith this is matt i’d just add that you should expect which i know you’re modeling to do so that sales meanwhile will be picking up we anticipate further as the year goes along in the second quarter certainly being part of that positive trend keith hughes part of that’s going to be the price increases can you give us some sort of idea on how much price increases are going up in some of your bigger industries that matches furniture automotive things like that karl g glassman keith it’s karl it varies by industry and the timing varies by closeness to the raw materials so in the industrial we would have seen some price increases that were implemented and passed through in q residential markets are seeing more of that in second q the bedding increases range from  to  that’s probably a good number on home furniture especially in asia the industrial markets would be experiencing a similar trend and to susan’s earlier point we don’t know what’s going to happen to steel going forward steel’s inherently choppy it’s almost impossible to make an intelligent forecast as to what steel will do as an example we sit here late april as you know scrap in may won’t sell until middle of may we don’t know what scrap’s going to do we think it might pull up in the  range but we just frankly don’t know but we have been successful at passing through the price increases as our people typically are keith hughes okay and final question i’m a little surprised that the weakness in the furniture sales and fashion bed and giving comments of anything – what happened in the quarter there j mitchell dolloff this is mitch generally we saw weakness at retail this is simple as that keith hughes okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions the next question is from the line of dillard watt with stifel please proceed with your question dillard watt thanks good morning susan r mccoy hi dillard dillard watt i wanted to talk a little bit about adjustables i think that pace of growth accelerated a little bit from the fourth quarter to the first and i admittedly i don’t have the comparisons from the two prior years in front of me so anything going on there that you’re seeing a pickup or is it just some of the yearoveryear issues matthew c flanigan no i think we continue to win new programs some major new programs are launched early in the first quarter in fact earlier they were expected so that’s really what helped drive some of the strong growth in the first quarter and has us well positioned for the balance of the year dillard watt okay great and then we’re still seeing the meaningful outperformance in comfortcore relative to the rest of the spring business pretty well known the content gains you’re getting there does that continue through the year in terms of that wide of a spread or how should we think about the underlying trends in the bedding business versus what you’re doing with nano and some of the other comfortcore products perry e davis hi dillard this is perry we would expect to continue to see growth in comfortcore as we go through the year as those programs launch and as programs ramp up we’ll see it at least through the second and third quarter i believe and part of that you’re right is the fact not only in terms of pieces that we believe that there’s a continuing transition from open coil to comfortcore type products but we also anticipate seeing those content gains relative to some of the innovation we’ve had surrounding quantum edge products that have builtin edge support that replace what formally had been some foam content dillard watt great thanks and then finally still on the bedding i don’t know the best way to ask the question here but just kind of any thoughts you may have on how temporary mattress may have changed things for you guys and if you’ve seen anything of an impact i guess through april here and if you expect anything differently to play out through the second part of the year perry e davis things have still yet to settle out there’s a lot of commotion going on with reflooring of product changes to lines we’re working to establish those forecast going forward but we believe overall that we’re in a good position we obviously are a major supplier to the industry and there are – when you step on one balloon sometimes another one pops up but we think overall that we’re well positioned to take advantage of any growth that would be seen in the marketplace and plus with the innovation i talked about earlier i think our content gains have us in a good spot karl g glassman dillard this is karl to bobby’s earlier question the fact that we do anticipate a significant increased investment in advertising is historically good for us as the consumer becomes more aware of that bedding innovation so we remain very bullish on the remainder of the year to perry’s point kickoff by memorial day the floors are set they’re ready to go we just need the holiday to get here dillard watt great thank you guys and good luck karl g glassman thank you operator operator instructions our next question is a follow up from the line of robert majek with cjs please go ahead robert majek thank you just one more from me you previously mentioned  to  incremental margins on volume growth while utilizing spare capacity how much more room is there for revenue growth at these incremental margins until we kind of hit full capacity susan r mccoy hi robert yes it’s a good question and you might imagine a number that’s difficult to pin down really precisely we have grown organically a lot over the last call it five six years we used to have a number we would share that was pretty high and today that number is far lower than it used to be our best guess is it’s under  million and it is widely variable by business there are businesses as you know that have grown more and we’re investing today to support all of the growth that they’re getting out as an example of that but there’s others too in bedding and parts of bedding where we’re growing we’re putting investments in place to support that so many businesses do still have spare capacity available when volume does come back into those places we see a nice benefit from incremental margins more broadly across the company you’re going to see relatively lower incrementals because of the costs that are being invested to support the growth it’s still good but not probably as quite that high as a range robert majek thank you operator thank you at this time i’ll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks karl
