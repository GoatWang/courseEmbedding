largest undeveloped deposits of nonferrous metal these coppernickelcobaltplatinumpalladiumgold deposits are in a belt stretching  miles just south of the eastern end of the historic mesabi iron rangethe major source of iron ore for the domestic steel industry for more than  years polymets project is comprised of two significant assets the northmet deposit and the erie plant formerly owned by ltv steel mining company which is an iron ore processing facility six miles west of the deposit connected by a private railroad   dnr polymets mining plan meets standards st paul minn  the minnesota dnrs final environmental review for minnesotas proposed polymet coppernickel mine says the companys proposal meets the states environmental and health standards the  page report known as a final environmental impact statement or eis is a  year study that found polymets plan is sound enough to protect the states natural resources kare  polymet mining the document says mine runoff would not reach the boundary waters canoe area wilderness or voyageurs national park which has been a concern raised by critics it also said polymet would employ state of the art technology to maintain air quality and reduce harmful emissions  its been thoughtful objective and thorough weve really turned this upside down inside out backward and forward to take a look at it said tom landwehr mn dnr commissioner landwehr compared the process to an inspection when someone buys a house pointing out strengths and weaknesses he emphasized the environmental review is not a recommendation for the project neither for nor against the construction of the open pit mine we are truly neutral either support or are opposed to the project said landwehr landwehr said polymet would have to make sure that all cleanup costs are covered after the mine closes which would be determined during the permitting process the report also said wastewater treatment plans must be kept in place indefinitely thats the boiling point for environmental groups opposed to the project we are talking about a water treatment model that is based on data the company built and the dnr has never independently verified – there is a lot to be concerned about here said kathryn hoffman minnesota center for environmental advocacy attorney as the dnr claims it has acted independently hoffman says minnesotans shouldnt believe its safe thats right because that claim is based on faulty data because its polymets data said hoffman polymet faces an extensive process more than  permits according to landwehr who said its still too premature to determine whether the project will move forward polymet president and ceo jon cherry called the final environmental review a huge milestone and in a press release said the final eis demonstrates that polymet can mine and process copper nickel and platinum group metals in a manner that complies with the law protects the environment and creates hundreds of highpaying jobs in northern minnesota while creating value for shareholders governor mark dayton visited mines in south dakota and michigan ahead of his decision whether to advance copper and nickel mining on the iron range and has described the decision as one of the most difficult hell make in his career he said he also require an exhaustive financial review of the company the  million dollar project would be located in the st louis river watershed on the eastern edge of the mesabi iron range about  miles south of babbitt and about  mile south of the existing ironore northshore mine processing of the ore would take place at a former industrial site the ltv steel plant in hoyt lakes concerns can be addressed in a day public comment period the agency will determine early next year likely in february whether the review is adequate then the company can start applying for permits     providing metals used in daily life after years of environmental research and project development polymet is poised to begin mining in minnesotas duluth complexwhich contains one of the worlds largest undeveloped nonferrous metal deposits polymet will mine and process metals used in daily life including copper  construction plumbing and electric wiring nickel  stainless steel and rechargeable batteries cobalt  household magnets and hybrid vehicles platinum  palladium  catalytic converters that reduce

basic materials » mining  miscellaneous zacks earnings esp expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have seen  annual returns on average according to our

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information
