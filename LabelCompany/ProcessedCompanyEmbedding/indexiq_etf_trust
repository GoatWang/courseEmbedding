etf the fund’s investment performance because it is a fund of funds depends on the investment performance of the underlying etfs in which it invests there is no guarantee that the fund itself or each of the etfs in the fund’s portfolio will perform exactly as its underlying index the fund’s underlying etfs invest in foreign securities which subject them to risk of loss not typically associated with domestic markets such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty commodities markets which subject them to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities such as stocks and bonds and fixed income securities which subject them to credit risk – the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments andor repay the principal on its debt – and interest rate risk – changes in the value of a fixedincome security resulting from changes in interest rates loss may result from the imposition of exchange controls confiscations and other government restrictions foreign risks will normally be greater when the fund invests in emerging markets leverage including borrowing will cause some of the fund’s underlying etfs to be more volatile than if the underlying etfs had not been leveraged returns less than  year are cumulative all other returns are annualized  fund inception date october   the index and fund performance since inception in the
