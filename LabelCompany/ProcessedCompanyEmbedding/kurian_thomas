oracle’s president of product development has the task of integrating netsuite into oracle’s efforts to expand its cloudcomputing offerings credit aaron wojack for the new york times redwood shores calif — it was not all that difficult for the silicon valley software giant oracle to pay  billion for a company called netsuite but then writing big checks has rarely been a problem for oracle which over the last  years has acquired dozens of companies in its quest to find more and more customersthe hard part is now in the hands of thomas kurian a softspoken yearold who has to figure out how the new purchase will work with what oracle already haswhile lawrence j ellison oracle’s brash executive chairman is still an outsize personality at the company he cofounded mr kurian has been the key figure in oracle’s attempted reinvention overseeing sweeping changes in its engineering that includes the creation of a network of  data centers around the world a project that has cost perhaps  billion netsuite is oracle’s first major acquisition intended to tie right into this new global system“money isn’t the problem for us” said mr kurian who is oracle’s president of product development he added that “between  and  we spent some  billion to  billion on acquisitions” advertisement continue reading the main story oracle became a giant by selling directly to businesses software packages that do things like manage the books and keep track of customers now most industry experts think the company needs to show that it is finally in a position to rein in competitors that have been stealing customers away with fresher technology delivered over the internet a concept called cloud computing continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story and the tradeoffs oracle must now make — accepting lower profit margins because customers are less interested in the older pricier technology — reflect the hard decisions many older tech companies must make to avoid getting left behind“there’s no doubt oracle moved late” said al hilwa an analyst at idc “they had doubts about the business and the profit margins but the way companies are spending forced them to change”oracle’s new data centers are intended to power a cloudcomputing network to compete with the established services provided by the likes of google amazon microsoft and ibm and the netsuite acquisition could help oracle pull even with smaller cloudfocused companies like salesforce and workday which provide their own technology to manage business operations like sales and human resourcesmr kurian would seem an unlikely person to play such a key role in one of silicon valley’s iconic companies born and raised in a middleclass family in bangalore india mr kurian ended his first day in the united states in his freshman dorm room at princeton university which he shared with his identical twin george who is now chief executive at netapp another silicon valley company“the day we left india was the first day we saw a computer” said george kurian who after graduation worked at oracle while thomas kurian was a consultant at mckinsey the two also went to stanford business school togethermark v hurd and safra a catz both chief executives at oracle manage the company’s sales and finance mr ellison who is  and shows no inclination to retire counts on mr kurian to run the core of any big tech company thousands of engineersthe netsuite deal is something of a comingout party for oracle’s global cloud possibly signaling the start of a new round of acquisitions along with hefty spending to keep building out this network but spending upward of  billion a year on building a cloud network mr kurian said is table stakes for the biggest tech companies advertisement continue reading the main story in netsuite oracle saw a cloud company whose sales of ecommerce and manufacturing software to smaller businesses were stalling as it tried to move into international markets oracle figured it could distribute that software efficiently over its cloud it also hopes to reach smaller companies that can’t afford oracle’s traditional highcost highmaintenance product newsletter

oracle since he owns about  percent of that company mr ellison who is already worth  billion according to bloomberg will reap another  billion on the netsuite deal he still attends regular corporate strategy sessions along with mr hurd ms catz and mr kurian grilling each on their respective portfoliosoracle has hundreds of different types of software for businesses but more than anything it is known for powerful databases many global airlines banks and manufacturers wouldn’t function without themcustomers treat the big oraclestrength software like sacred objects that should never be altered while they’re happy to experiment for example with a new offering from amazon that’s one reason oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology said steve miranda oracle’s vice president of applications development“new companies have what is called ‘a minimum viable product’ they can sell” said mr miranda a year veteran at oracle at his company mr miranda said that minimum is in reality a fairly highend productmr kurian who has been at oracle for  years is known to move quickly in meetings seeking slides ahead of a presentation and immediately zeroing in on the one slide where he spots a problem if there are no problems the meeting is canceled softspoken or not he will let rip a profanitylaced tirade if he sees too many problems“i won’t comment on the language but we are very honest with each other very hard on ourselves and very direct” said mr miranda “if you’re striving to be the best of the best it comes with the territory”as fast as mr kurian moves oracle down the technology field the competition keeps moving the goal posts soon after the netsuite deal thursday amazon announced that its cloud business had secondquarter revenue of  billion just the amount amazon’s cloud segment grew from the previous quarter  million was  million more than all netsuite’s revenue for the second quartermuch of that revenue comes from selling barebones computing that oracle doesn’t care about but increasingly amazon is offering its own databases and customers are signing on it targets oracle directly at its promotional events and offers something called “serverless computing” which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses — another potential threat to oracle’s profit margins advertisement continue reading the main story oracle has built a large operation in seattle paying big for cloud talent from amazon and microsoft google also has operations there making seattle something of the nation’s cloud town but local hands there say oracle isn’t yet a noticeable presence“right now i go to allday meetings and their name doesn’t come up” said matt mcilwain a managing director of the madrona venture group a seattle venture firmthe next big competition in cloud computing also involves artificial intelligence fed by loads of data soon mr kurian said oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in oracle databases the company has anonymized data from  companies including three billion consumers and  million business profiles representing  trillion in consumer purchases“most of the world’s data is already inside oracle databases” said mr kurianthat’s the kind of hold on people’s information that perhaps only facebook can match but mark zuckerberg doesn’t sell business software at least not yet continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage oracle’s  billion deal
