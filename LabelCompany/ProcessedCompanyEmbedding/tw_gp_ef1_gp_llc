american rider jason disalvo will compete in the moto class at the red bull indianapolis gp on aug  at the indianapolis motor speedway as a wildcard entry disalvo  from stafford ny will ride an ftr m backed by gp tech in moto which features motorcycles with cc honda engines and dunlop tires former racer geoff maloney is managing the team three american riders will compete in the moto race disalvo roger lee hayden on a wildcard team hondamoriwaki entry managed by  cc world champion kevin schwantz and fulltime jack  jones by antonio banderas rider kenny noyes “it’s amazing what geoff maloney and the gp tech team have accomplished in getting everything prepared in such little time as the help from various people and organizations around the us has been tremendous” disalvo said “i’m excited about being on indy for the first time and hope to get up to speed fast on the ftr chassis and have a good result come race day”excerpts from “thrown to the wolves” thrown to the wolves a tale of two moto  teams at indy by dean adams wednesday september   longtime rivals jason disalvo and roger lee hayden raced their first moto event at indianapolis this past weekend disalvo finished ninth in the race and considered it a small victory and success it was a dreamcometrue race he said because i was less than thrilled with my qualifying i thought it was going to be more of a nightmare starting from back in th both veteran riders said that the moto start was more wwfstyle wrestling than motorcycle racing disalvo commented the start was a surreal experience i dont know that i ever want to have to go through that again i was actually pretty mortified that i had to go through it twice in one race with  guys in the grid its really like someone pulled the pin on a grenade and threw it in the middle of the pack when everything tightened up into turn two it was just survival at that point my first start was kind of like not so good and so having it done to having it to do over again i wasnt thrilled about it but in the end i think it worked out the best because we were sitting in a little bit better position i was maybe a little bit more calm the second time around both disalvo and hayden have raced dirt track previously and seemingly a good comparison for a moto start is the last chance qualifier at a short track right not even comparable disalvo said because it would be likethink about this too how many guys start a dirt track race like  maximum eighteen and thats intense thats intense and amazing and its a great sensation theres bumping around and stuff like that but you dont worry about  other guys piling into you if you hit the deck though man it was so nervewracking but the whole weekend though was just amazing except turn  was a little nuts thats for sure for disalvo that he survived the restart on two wheels was an important part to his finishing well i just tried to stay steady and fast and just do the best i could and it worked out kind of like how i thought it would at the beginning the former world supersport rider said because everyones so tight in this class everyone just sort of stacked up in a train i had been saying from the beginning my plan was just get through the beginning safe and then try to pick guys off one at a time i knew i had the speed i knew the bike was strong on some of the corner exits particularly the last corner i knew we could get out of there really really well and thats where i made a lot of draftpass moves on the straightaway in going into turn  so everything just worked out i was really really happy to be able to get that good of a result especially coming from back in the grid so next time well try to qualify a little bit better and then see if we cant make it interesting at the frontfrom motogpcom the american scored a highly impressive ninth place in the moto race on sunday and would welcome the chance to ride full time next season disalvo reviews impressive indy wild card result the american presence on the moto grid at the red bull indianapolis grand prix was trebled on sunday as joining regular rider kenny noyes was the well publicised wild card roger lee hayden and another oneoff entrant jason disalvo it was the  yearold from new york state who scored the best result of the three riding to a notable ninth place in the race on board his ftr chassis of the gp tech team “this has been a dream weekend for us” said disalvo “everybody working on the bike did a fantastic job and i cannot thank them enough it shows their quality that we only had this bike for about a week before the race they’re unbelievable” disalvo who started from th on the grid continued “when the other guys were sliding about a bit our bike seemed to get better sliding really suited my style and i was able to pick guys off and work my way up i can’t put into words what a great weekend it’s been” giving his assessment of the new intermediate cc class disalvo added “it’s an incredibly high level of racing it’s difficult with so many riders there may be guys who finish far back who have so much talent with  guys on the track it’s chaos sometimes” after his standout result it is likely that disalvo could be the recipient of the attention of some teams for the  season and he would be keen on a fulltime ride in the world championship “for the right team i think it’d be a wonderful opportunity” he said “for next year i’m keeping my options open this is my only race for this year we don’t have a fulltime ride or anything so it’s back to practicing my golf game for now”related
