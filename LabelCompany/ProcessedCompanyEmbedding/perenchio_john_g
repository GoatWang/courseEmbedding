thishousewillexistorg   john g perenchio director deckers outdoor corporation john g perenchio age  has served as a director since december  beginning in  mr perenchio has held controlling interests in and has been the principal manager of various music industry companies sorry for my poor english translation jerrols perenchio is father of john g perenchio a jerrols perenchio univision became weak in the spanishlanguage broadcaster in the world he bought the canal in  with  million latin american partners was sold in march to  billion by haim saban at first jerry perenchio formed embassy communications along with norman lear and sold to coca cola programming by  million in  a perenchio does not like the press and is one of the largest landowners in malibu john mccain supported  sunivision televisa targeted by emilio azcarraga seeking to increase its competitive advantage against threats of carlos slim his most serious rival in the triple play both are grouped together create national and international partnerships and leave the world of shopping in the moments that redefine the rules of telecommunications in mexico televisa is preparing a strategic move taking control of univision the consortium will be chaired by emilio azcarraga in advanced talks for a second tryinconsolidating media conglomerate in the hispanic televisions most important united states and though the play look offensive the fact is that also dyes defensive considering that carlos slim is moving in the acquisition of media and content not only in mexico but also in the spanish speaking world what at the end of the day seems to be at stake is which of the two telecommunications giants mexicanazcárraga or slimassume the dominant position when completed in recognition of their infrastructure for triple play voice data and video and in recent months is the activity of televisa notorious for taking a better position in the telephony world dominated by telmex and telcel the acquisition of a stake of  percent in nextel and strategic alliances with telefonica and megacable to operate the fiber optic cfe make clear that the interests of emilio azcarraga are in open confrontation with carlos slim but the chairman of grupo carso is not idle and although he was not authorizing the transmission of television across their networks of copper and optical fiber content partnerships continue to move in the spanish speaking world and the alliance known as mvs joaquín vargas has been very cautiously adding a strategic agreement with tv azteca some analysts attribute this rapprochement between carlos slim ricardo salinas pliego and the escalation of clashes between the station of san angel and ajusco  its created for john g perenchio some have already reached the courts as the lawsuit filed by tv azteca against the submissions  nextel and televisa wins a national  megahertz block with an initial payment of   million and amortization to  years value of the inflation one thousand  million dollars but perhaps the most obvious dispute which is projected on the screens is that they hold for some months the two television stations that had a pact not to steal their exclusive artists the most recent case was that of the host laura bozzo the famous miss laura who with a rising program in tv azteca this week announced his sudden change to televisa the same thing happened months ago with silvia navarro alan tacher and lizzette identified as unique star who emigrated tv azteca televisa suddenly televisa tv azteca only recognized out of the singer dulce but carlos slim helu alliances are not limited to mexican broadcasters or producers it is known in south america that the mexican telecommunications magnate would be seeking to acquire strategic positions in some television in colombia argentina chile and even venezuela especially now that some south american soap operas like cartel de los sapos killer women and the capo to name a few are of sufficient quality to conquer markets not only in mexico but also in us hispanic communities together hence the warning from televisa executives and their decision to return to the negotiating table for the second time the purchase of univision this is given to the possibility that carlos slim may come forward to bid for the spanish television station which although has a very large audience present poor financial results as a product of unsurpassed economic crisis in america and that is perhaps one of the reasons that televisa would be sitting at the table of negotiations with the consortium to have contracts that will leave   million a year but with the large holding legal disputes over the control and dissemination of its contents  site for john g perenchio a long and bitter history the lovehate relationship between televisa and univision dates from  when the mexican television contracts signed with american programming exclusive use for  years but the conflict came to a head in  when the largest shareholder jerrold perenchio ray rodriguez beat as president of univision without proper consultation with their peers veto televisa and although televisa and venevision the cisneros group wielded each  per cent stake in univision perenchio with an equal part controlled  percent of the voting rights in the council the imposition of ray rodriguez broke the relationship between the partners emilio azcarraga resigned from the board of univision and began a bitter and protracted dispute over broadcasting rights to televisas programs in the us chain maturing in  televisas lawyers began to seek the cancellation of the contract fincado in violation of signed agreements and disputes soured even more when you joined the internet broadcasting rights which were not covered in the original contract the constant threat of mexican programming that univision would weaken the action jerrold perenchio eventually relist univision televisa but it was not the highest bidder the channel leading spanishcontrolled united states ended in  by the saban group a consortium led by media mogul haim saban the incident became a hit of pride for televisa to strained relations counter looking for univisions shareholders react but all in vain and although in recent years eliminated some differences tensions continued when televisa threatened to remove  percent of univisions programming to migrate to other hispanic networks rivals now is the financial situation of univision to the global crisis and the urgency of televisa to consolidate its dominance in television content which could consummate the dream long cherished by emilio azcarraga jean but remember that the soap opera is just beginning that heroes can become villains and villains into heroes but above all that the end may be unexpected  televisa and univision joined forces univision has accomplished this year to consolidate itself as the fifth broadcast television network in the united states and even at times lead the audience in prime time against cbs nbc abc and fox the chain was born in  with the participation of emilio azcarraga milmo father of current president of televisa and in  was bought by american billionaire jerrold perenchio with minority participation azcarraga and the venezuelan group cisneros in  perenchio sold univision by  million to a group of investors led by haim saban chairman of the board of directors of univision communications the dispute with televisa and the reduction of advertising revenues in recent years because of the economic crisis univision had placed in a delicate position to negotiate the debt of  million expiring in  which will now on more favorable terms    televisa honor and businesses the name of univision to televisa is a business matter but also of honor at the root of univision is the footprint of the azcarraga dynasty the grandfather of the current president of televisa was the founder of spanishlanguage tv in the us and his father who came to control univision was forced to sell the company charged operate through prestanombres univisions history is inextricably linked to that of televisa and if the consortium of azcarraga could not be absolute master of the american chain limit is due to us laws provide for foreign investment azcarraga dynasty in  mexican telesistema chaired by emilio azcarraga vidaurreta bought in the us two tv channels one in los angeles and one in san antonio with the aim of passing in that country programs in spanish both channels started operating in  under the name of spanish international network sin

the shares of sicc it had provided the capital to american citizens to finance the seasons due to failure the company had to be sold to hallmark in  and changed its name to univision with the idea of
