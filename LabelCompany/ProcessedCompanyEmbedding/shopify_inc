except for this one important variable brian stoffel tmfcheesehead jul   at am the story is pretty amazing snowboarder tries to start his own snowboard company when he tries to build an ecommerce presence there are no options he likes so he makes his own over time that business outshines the snowboards eventually the company is taken public in a nutshell thats what happened to tobias lutke founder and ceo of shopify nyseshop the company offers a subscription platform to help small and mediumsized businesses build sales channels across the internet as well as merchant services focused on payment and shipping solutions shares of the relatively young public company are up almost  since february  that has a lot of investors asking how risky is this stock image source getty images risk and volatility are two different things the first represents the chances you could lock in serious losses of capital while the second has more to do with shortterm fluctuations as youll see i define risk over four different axes and only on the last is shopify truly a risky stock how strong is the moat by far the most important thing to evaluate from the perspective of risk is the strength of a companys moat  or its sustainable competitive advantage in shopify i believe we have a company with a very strong moat in the form of high switching costs imagine you start your website using shopifys platform and slowly and steadily you build a presence that brings in money for you moving to a different provider would involve a hefty sum of cash retraining employees on a new system and potential downtime for your customers it is also a minefield for the unknown unknown headaches considering all that what would it take for you to switch over to a competing platform so far shopifys roster of clients has shown no signs of slowing down shopifys strong moatinfogram shopify is also the preferred platform for businesses trying to sell products on facebook amazoncom pintrest twitter and  as of just recently  ebay those are serious endorsements from some of the most powerful players in the world i dont see competition as a huge risk for investors at this point though that could of course change over time financial fortitude the second risk worth investigating especially for an unprofitable company like shopify is financial fortitude the widest moat in the world wont matter if an economic downturn hits tomorrow and the company is forced to file for bankruptcy protection but after a recent stock offering shopifys balance income and cash flow sheets look very strong cash debt net income free cash flow   million   million  million data source sec filings net income and free cash flow presented on trailingmonth basis while some might scoff that shopify has lost  million over the past  months i think its a wise decision to continually spend slightly more than the company brings in avoid profitability  grab market shareinfogram thats because once the company is profitable wall street will be clamoring for everhigher figures its best for the company to grab as much market share as possible right now  remember those high switching costs  and worry about profitability later with almost  million in cash on the books and having lost just over  million in free cash flow last year shopify can keep this trend going for a while concentration risks the third type of risk longterm investors should investigate is that which comes from relying on just a few customers for an outsize portion of sales referred to as customer concentration risk this situation makes a company fragile by putting itself at the whim of its clients  where one unfavorable decision made one person at one company could doom investors while shopify does have some bigname clients  tesla budweiser and red bull  among them  the chart from the first section shows that with over  clients concentration risk is not a major concern valuation risk finally we have the one major risk that investors should be worried about the stocks price shopifys stock has doubled in  alone it currently has a market cap of almost  billion and trades for   times sales to put that in perspective amazon  itself still a growth story  trades for  times sales there are huge expectations baked into shopifys stock and if you cant stomach some gutwrenching falls that can happen if the stock falls on the slightest whiff of unfavorable news this isnt an investment for you that said i think that is a shortterm concern many of the worlds greatest companies were considered overvalued during their nascent stages those who didnt buy shares paid the price yes the stock will probably be volatile and that requires a strong stomach and a longterm time horizon but if you have those two things i believe the risks associated with shopify are less than you might think and my own skin is in the game the company accounts for over  of my reallife holdings you might want to consider it for your portfolio as well
