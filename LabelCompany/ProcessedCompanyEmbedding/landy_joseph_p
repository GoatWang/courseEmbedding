perrythe new york timesjoseph p landy left and charles r kaye copresidents of warburg which has been careful not to depend too heavily on leveraged buyouts when megabuyouts were booming several years ago private equity firms raced to go public today the stock market has punished those firms that succeeded shares of the blackstone group which was first out of the gate have dropped in value by more than half since their june  initial public offering kohlberg kravis roberts and apollo global management which reached the market later have fallen more than  percent this year agonizing over its stock price is not something that warburg pincus plans to do in an interview in the firm’s midtown manhattan offices this summer warburg’s copresidents charles r kaye and joseph p landy insist they will stay private “we like being investors” mr kaye said “we don’t necessarily want to go into the multiasset class gathering or multiasset class management path and be public” to translate the world’s largest firms — blackstone kkr and apollo — are now giant publicly traded money managers overseeing not only multibilliondollar private equity funds but also big hedge funds real estate investment operations and various other businesses by slapping their brands on an array of products these firms have diversified their revenue in part to please analysts and shareholders “they’re moving in other directions that were not part of their historical base or where they created names for themselves” mr landy said warburg plans to stick to its knitting investing out of one giant global fund and keeping itself off the stock market the firm is scheduled to begin raising money for a new  billion vehicle in the coming weeks according to people briefed on the matter it is a path that warburg has followed for four decades before the term “private equity” even existed and it is a model that most of the private equity industry which manages some  trillion still follows yet it is largely blackstone kkr and apollo that define a popular vision of the modern private equity shop the firms’ top executives have become celebrities their donations and lavish parties appearing in the gossip pages the main building of the new york public library in midtown manhattan is named for stephen a schwarzman the head of blackstone on wednesday duke announced that david m rubenstein a cofounder of the carlyle group whose ipo is expected later this year plans to donate  million to the university’s library system mr landy and mr kaye are not exactly wallflowers mr landy serves on the national executive board of the boy scouts of america and mr kaye is the former chairman of the asia society in new york but for warburg keeping its firm private is a matter of maintaining business focus that means investing in companies in a variety of stages from venture investments like the canadian oil explorer canbriam energy to classic leveraged buyouts like the takeovers of neiman marcus and bausch  lomb by contrast the publicly traded private equity firms are building out new businesses to buttress their steady stream of management fees historically those annual payments — typically  percent to  percent of assets — were a small portion of these firms’ earnings instead they depended on lumpier performance fees taking a share of the profits on successful deals some large investors including the nation’s biggest pension fund managers have expressed reservations about private equity firms as public companies “we don’t really have a problem with private equity funds going into new businesses” said donald pierce the interim chief investment officer of the san bernardino county employees’ retirement association a  billion fund “but the real question is whether moving away from their core focus will affect their returns” though its roots stretch back to the venerable em warburg  company warburg pincus dates to  when lionel i pincus and john vogelstein created a partnership aimed at investing in a variety of companies today it manages more than  billion with offices in nine cities including shanghai and são paulo brazil the firm has only one main investment fund at any given time unlike competitors who raise specific funds for say mezzanine debt or asian real estate during the financial crisis the firm along with other private equity shops saw an opportunity in the battered banking sector it committed  million from its fund to large minority stakes across four banks webster financial sterling financial national penn and banco indusval of brazil by investing from one pool of money warburg executives say they are trying to avoid having to invest for investing’s sake — buying a tech company simply because they are sitting on money in a technologyfocused fund that needs to be deployed warburg also has less of a central focus on leveraged buyouts the classic private equity transaction in which a firm borrows large amounts of money to take companies private “we’ve always had this broad mandate so that when the lbo world falls off a cliff we don’t need to do lbo’s” mr landy said referring to leveraged buyouts “this whole diversified strategy at the core of what we do allows us the kind of flexibility that many of these firms are trying to get today” executives say that strategy has helped the firm realize some of its biggest hits this year warburg and blackstone held an ipo for kosmos energy an oil producer focused on fields in west africa beginning in  warburg led three financing rounds for the company totaling about  billion kosmos’s may ipo in which its owners sold a  percent stake raised more than  million warburg’s  percent stake alone is now worth  billion on paper but the firm has had its misses as well none has been more prominent
