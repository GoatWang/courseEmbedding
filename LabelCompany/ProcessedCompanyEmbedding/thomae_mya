regulation of in vitro diagnostics on todays show she shares with us the advice that she gives her clients seeking fda approval for their diagnostic products mya weighs in on the issue of ldts the fda says it has the authority to regulate ldts but so far has issued no draft guidance this is creating an unfair playing field for those producing codx which are regulated has the fda been waiting for the election to issue guidance does obamas reelection or the recent spygate and meningitis outbreak really affect the fda ms thomae travels often to washington and offers her informed views click here

a more assertive fda listen 0 why has andme not stopped selling the product on monday november th the fda sent a letter to the directtoconsumer genetic testing company andme the letter has received a bit more attention than the average fda correspondence the letter was addressed to andme ceo anne wojcicki and told her that the company’s personal genome service was in violation of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda requested that the company “immediately discontinue marketing” the test until it receives authorization since the letter came out there has been much discussion in the life science industry and with the public at large some say the letter reveals an over reaching paternalistic government agency trying to hold back the inevitable while others see the opportunity for a turning point for a diagnostics industry mya thomae has been helping companies comply with fda regulations for 0 years mya is intimate with how the fda works and laments that the diagnostics industry as opposed to the regulated therapeutics industry has been on a race to the bottom she doesnt hesitate when asked whether the andme test is a medical device genetic tests are certainly medical devices and theres numerous examples of different types of genetic tests moving their way through fda she says the problem with andme mya asserts is that they havent done the hard core clinical trials to show that their algorithms do indeed work as they say and she finds it unfair that andme can keep selling their tests while at the same time some companies are doing the trials are working with the fda and are putting in the time and effort to develop quality tests speaking of the andme website mya points out hat the results are constantly changing based on the latest research paper that has just come out some folks have referred to it as results roulette she says should andme be treated different from her clients who are pursuing regulation i think andme is different but i think its different in the way that makes it a research project as opposed to a product that should be giving clinical results to patients she says what about our right to obtain our own genetic information and how are the andme results different from checking your risk factor for heart disease against the framingham studies at the nih website mya addresses these and other concerns which have risen in the media since the letter was published she also explains that regulation will be good for business as well as patients is the letter any different from previous fda letters and does it signal a more assertive fda when it comes to ldts mya says shes lost some bets already on when the fda will regulate ldts but she does see a shift happening at the end of the interview she refers to some final guidance the fda issued on ruo research use only kits the same day the letter to andme was posted ruo kits and reagents are not allowed for use with diagnostic tests that are approved by the fda we end with the question why hasnt andme stopped selling the product editors note on dec  0 andme discontinued selling any health related reports in compliance with the fdas request podcast
