out to shareholders as a dividend so a payout ratio of  would mean for every  earnt they pay c as a dividend likewise a payout ratio of  means the company is paying out more as a dividend than it earns usually this is paid out of debt or cash the company currently pays out 9 of its earnings as a dividend which means that the dividend is not well covered by earnings in  years time the analysts
