principles gaap however the company believes certain nongaap performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results the results of its peers and of prior periods in addition the company believes these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry see the reconciliations throughout this release of gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures for the periods indicated reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted net income loss and adjusted earnings per share the company’s presentation of adjusted net income loss and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the effect of certain items are nongaap financial measures adjusted net income loss and adjusted earnings per share represent earnings and diluted earnings per share determined under gaap without regard to certain noncash and unusual items the company believes these measures provide useful information to analysts and investors for analysis of its operating results on a recurring comparable basis from period to period adjusted net income loss and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for earnings or diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies the following table provides a reconciliation from the gaap measure of net income loss to adjusted net income loss nongaap both in total and on a per diluted share basis for the periods indicated                   three months ended march  in millions except per share amounts               net income loss  as reported

to ebitdax ebitdax as defined below is presented herein and reconciled from the gaap measure of net income loss because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities the company defines ebitdax as net income loss plus  exploration and abandonments expense  depreciation depletion and amortization expense  accretion expense  impairments of longlived assets  noncash stockbased compensation expense  gain on derivatives  net cash receipts from derivatives  gain on disposition of assets net  interest expense and  federal and state income tax expense benefit ebitdax is not a measure of net income loss or cash flows as determined by gaap the company’s ebitdax measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand the company’s operations and it is also a material component of one of the financial covenants under the company’s credit facility ebitdax is one of several metrics that the company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income loss as an indicator of operating performance certain items excluded from ebitdax are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets ebitdax as used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the company believes that ebitdax is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the company’s management team and by other users of the company’s consolidated financial statements including by lenders pursuant to a covenant in the company’s credit facility for example ebitdax can be used to assess the company’s operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure and to assess the financial performance of the company’s assets and the company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis further under the company’s credit facility an event of default could arise if it were not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with its specified financial ratio defined as the maintenance of a quarterly ratio of total debt to consolidated last twelve months ebitdax of no greater than  to  noncompliance with this ratio could trigger an event of default under the company’s credit facility which then could trigger an event of default under its indentures at march   the company was in compliance with the covenants under all of its debt instruments the following table provides a reconciliation of the gaap measure of net income loss to ebitdax nongaap for the periods indicated                   three
