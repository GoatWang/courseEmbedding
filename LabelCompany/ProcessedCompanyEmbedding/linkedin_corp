graph showing indemand tech skills for the citys tech talent pipeline project new user interface in edit soon after linkedins acquisition by microsoft on january   linkedins new desktop version was introduced the new version was meant to make the user experience seamless across mobile and desktop some of the changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app features that were not heavily used were removed for example the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported any more users reactionedit following the launch of the new interface some

facto tool for professional networking linkedin has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships linkedin is far and away the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today according to forbes linkedin has also received criticism primarily regarding email address mining and autoupdate the signup process includes a step for entering your email password there is an optout feature linkedin will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in your address book or that you have had email conversation with when the members email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to selected email addresses or to all up to  invitations can then be sent out in one click with no possibility to undo or withdraw them linkedin was sued for sending out another two followup invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation in november  linkedin lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of peoples names and images without authorization the lawsuit was eventually settled in  in favor of linkedin members changing the description below a members name is seen as a change in a job title even if it is just a wording change or even a change to unemployed unless a member opts to turn off activity updates an update is sent to all of that persons contacts telling them to congratulate the member on the new job the feature that allows linkedin members to endorse each others skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the members skills in october  linkedin acknowledged that it really does matter who endorsed you and began highlighting endorsements from coworkers and other mutual connections to address the criticism in  the catalan language advocacy organization fundació puntcat launched an online campaign asking

preventing hackers from gaining access to accounts in may   million linkedin usernames and passwords were offered for sale online for the equivalent of  these account details are believed to be

profile views important happenings in their network and other things linkedin uses the momentum email platform from message systems applicationsedit linkedin applications often refers to external third party applications that interact with linkedins developer api however in some cases it could refer to sanctioned applications featured on a users profile page external third party applicationsedit on february   linkedin released an updated terms of use for their developer api the developer api allows both companies and individuals the ability to interact with linkedins data through creation of managed third party applications applications must go through a review process and request permission from the user before accessing a users data normal use of the api is outlined in linkedins developer documents including sign into external services using linkedin add items or attributes to a user profile share items or articles to users timeline on a more rare occasion applications have been developed by third parties to extend linkedins native functions for instance linkedin does not allow users to define images that correlate with articles or links they share but this can be done using a third party application like linkedin advanced share embedded in profileedit in october  linkedin enabled an applications platform which allows external online services to be embedded within a members profile page among the initial applications were an amazon reading list that allows linkedin members to display books they are reading a connection to tripit and a six apart wordpress and typepad application that allows members to display their latest blog postings within their linkedin profile in november  linkedin allowed businesses to list products and services on company profile pages it also permitted linkedin members to recommend products and services and write reviews shortly after some of the external services were no longer supported including amazons reading list  mobileedit a mobile version of the site was launched in february  which gives access to a reduced feature set over a mobile phone the mobile service is available in six languages chinese english french german japanese and spanish in january  linkedin acquired cardmunch a mobile app maker that scans business cards and converts into contacts in june  cardmunch was noted as an available linkedin app in august  linkedin revamped its mobile applications on the iphone android and html at the time mobile page views of the application were increasing roughly  year over year according to ceo jeff weiner in october  linkedin announced a service for iphone users called intro which inserts a thumbnail of a persons linkedin profile in correspondence with that person when reading mail messages in the native ios mail program this is accomplished by rerouting all emails from and to the iphone through linkedin servers which security firm bishop fox asserts has serious privacy implications violates many organizations security policies and resembles a maninthemiddle attack groupsedit linkedin also supports the formation of interest groups and as of march   there are  such groups whose membership varies from  to  the majority of the largest groups are employment related although a very wide range of topics are covered mainly around professional and career issues and there are currentlywhen  groups for both academic and corporate alumnicitation needed groups support a limited form of discussion area moderated by the group owners and managers since groups offer the functionality to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of antispam solutions there is a constant stream of spam postings and there now exist a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose linkedin has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam but recentlywhen took the decision to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammerscitation needed groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group including most talked about discussions within your professional circles groups may be private accessible to members only or may be open to internet users in general to read though they must join in order to post messages in december  linkedin announced that they are rolling out polls to groups in november  linkedin announced the addition of showcase pages to the platform in  linkedin announced they were going to be removing product and services pages paving the way for a greater focus on showcase pages job listingsedit linkedin allows users to research companies nonprofit organizations and governments they may be

employees the percentage of the most common titlespositions held within the company the location of the companys headquarters and offices and a list of present and former employees in july  linkedin launched a new feature allowing companies to include an apply with linkedin button on job listing pages the new plugin allowed potential employees to apply for positions using their linkedin profiles as resumes online recruitingedit job recruiters head hunters and personnel hr are increasingly using linkedin as a source for finding potential candidates by using the advanced search tools recruiters can find members matching their specific key words with a click of a button they then can make contact with those members by sending a request to connect or by sending inmail about a specific job opportunity he or she may have recruiters also often join industry based groups on linkedin to create connections with professionals in that line of business skillsedit since september  linkedin has enabled users to endorse each others skills this feature also allows users to efficiently provide commentary on other users profiles – network building is reinforced however there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content linkedin solicits endorsements using algorithms that generate skills members might have members cannot opt out of such solicitations with the result that it sometimes appears that a member is soliciting an endorsement for a nonexistent skill publishing platformedit linkedin continues to add different services to its platform to expand the ways that people use it on may   linkedin added an analytics tool to its publishing platform the tool allows authors to better track traffic that their posts receive influencersedit the linkedin influencers program launched in october  and features global thought leaders who share their professional insights with linkedins members as of may  there are  influencers approximately  of which are male the

advertising on july   linkedin announced their sponsored updates ad service individuals and companies can now pay a fee to have linkedin sponsor their content and spread it to their user base this is a common way for social media sites such as linkedin to generate revenue future plansedit economic graphedit inspired by facebooks social graph linkedin ceo jeff weiner set a goal in  to create an economic graph within a decade the goal is to create a comprehensive digital map of the world economy and the connections within it the economic graph was to be built on the companys current platform with data nodes including companies jobs skills volunteer opportunities educational institutions and content they have been hoping to include all the job listings in the world all the skills required to get those jobs all the professionals who could fill them and all the companies nonprofit and forprofit at which they work the ultimate goal is to make the world economy and job market more efficient through increased transparency in june  the company announced its galene search architecture to give users access to the economic graphs data with more thorough filtering of data via user searches like engineers with hadoop experience in brazil linkedin has used economic graph data to research several topics on the job market including popular destination cities of recent college graduates areas with high concentrations of technology skills and common career transitions linkedin provided the city of new york with data from economic graph showing indemand tech skills for the citys tech talent pipeline project new user interface in edit soon after linkedins acquisition by microsoft on january   linkedins new desktop version was introduced the new version was meant to make the user experience seamless across mobile and desktop some of the changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app features that were not heavily used were removed for example the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported any more users reactionedit following the launch of the new interface some users including blogger zubair abbas complained about missing features which were there in the older version slowness and bugs in the ui the issues were faced by both free and premium users and with both the desktop version and the mobile version of the site dropped features in edit in january  linkedin dropped support for linkedin answers and cited a new focus on development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss professional topics across linkedin as the reason for the retirement of the feature the feature had been launched in  and allowed users to post question to their network and allowed users to rank answers business unitsedit linkedin derives its revenues from four business divisions talent solutions through which recruiters and corporations pay for branded corporation and career listing pages payperclick targeted job ads and access to the linkedin database of users and resumes marketing solutions which advertisers pay for pay per clickthrough targeted ads premium subscriptions through which linkedin users can pay for advanced services such as linkedin business linkedin talent for recruiters linkedin jobseeker and linkedin sales for sales professions learning solutions through which users can learn various skills related to their job function or personal learning goals on the lyndacom or linkedin learning platforms some elements of the various subscription services are also on a pay per use basis like inmaildefinition needed receptionedit linkedin has been described by online trade publication techrepublic as having become the de facto tool for professional networking linkedin has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships linkedin is far and away the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today according to forbes linkedin has also received criticism primarily regarding email address mining and autoupdate the signup process includes a step for entering your email password there is an optout feature linkedin will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in your address book or that you have had email conversation with when the members email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to selected email addresses or to all up to  invitations can then be sent out in one click with no possibility to undo or withdraw them linkedin was sued for sending out another two followup invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation in november  linkedin lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of peoples names and images without authorization the lawsuit was eventually settled in  in favor of linkedin members changing the description below a members name is seen as a change in a job title even if it is just a wording change or even a change to unemployed unless a member opts to turn off activity updates an update is sent to all of that persons contacts telling them to congratulate the member on the new job the feature that allows linkedin members to endorse each others skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the members skills in october  linkedin acknowledged that it really does matter who endorsed you and began highlighting endorsements from coworkers and other mutual connections to address the criticism in  the catalan language advocacy organization fundació puntcat launched an online campaign asking linkedin to support the language both in the platforms interface and as cv language it gained more than  online signatures in  plataforma per la llengua started another campaign asking for such a change international restrictionsedit in  syrian users reported that linkedin server stopped accepting connections originating from ip addresses assigned to syria the companys customer support stated that services provided by them are subject to us export and reexport control laws and regulations and as such and as a matter of corporate policy we do not allow member accounts or access to our site from cuba iran north korea sudan or syria in february  it was reported that linkedin was being blocked in china after calls for a jasmine revolution it was speculated to have been blocked because it is an easy way for dissidents to access twitter which had been blocked previously after a day of being blocked linkedin access was restored in china in february  linkedin launched its simplified chinese language version named  pinyin lǐngyīng literally leading elite officially extending their service in china linkedin ceo jeff weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in order to comply with chinese rules but he also said the benefits of providing its online service to people in china outweighed those concerns on  august  a moscow court ruled that linkedin must be blocked in russia for violating a new data retention law which requires the user data of russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country this ban was upheld on  november  and all russian isps began blocking linkedin thereafter linkedins mobile app was also banned from google play store and ios app store in russia in january  sna linkedinedit the search network and analytics sna team

linkedin has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships linkedin is far and away the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today according to forbes linkedin has also received criticism primarily regarding email address mining and autoupdate the signup process includes a step for entering your email password there is an optout feature linkedin will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in your address book or that you have had email conversation with when the members email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to selected email addresses or to all up to  invitations can then be sent out in one click with no possibility to undo or withdraw them linkedin was sued for sending out another two followup invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation in november  linkedin lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of peoples names and images without authorization the lawsuit was eventually settled in  in favor of linkedin members changing the description below a members name is seen as a change in a job title even if it is just a wording change or even a change to unemployed unless a member opts to turn off activity updates an update is sent to all of that persons contacts telling them to congratulate the member on the new job the feature that allows linkedin members to endorse each others skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the members skills in october  linkedin acknowledged that it really does matter who endorsed you and began highlighting endorsements from coworkers and other mutual connections to address the criticism in  the catalan language advocacy organization fundació puntcat launched an online campaign asking linkedin to support the language both in the platforms

leading elite officially extending their service in china linkedin ceo jeff weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in

in linkedins developer documents including sign into external services using linkedin add items or attributes to a user profile share items or articles to users timeline on a more rare occasion

this can be done using a third party application like linkedin advanced share embedded in profileedit in october  linkedin enabled an applications platform which allows external online services to be embedded within a members profile page among the initial applications were an amazon reading list that allows linkedin members to display books they are reading a connection to tripit and a six apart wordpress and typepad application that allows members to display their latest blog postings within their linkedin profile in november  linkedin allowed businesses to list products and services on

ceo jeff weiner in october  linkedin announced a service for iphone users called intro which inserts a thumbnail of a persons linkedin profile in correspondence with that person when reading mail

groups whose membership varies from  to  the majority of the largest groups are employment related although a very wide range of topics are covered mainly around professional and career issues and there are currentlywhen  groups for both academic and corporate alumnicitation needed groups support a limited form of discussion area moderated by the group owners and managers since groups offer the functionality to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of antispam solutions there is a constant stream of spam postings and there now exist a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose linkedin has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam but recentlywhen took the decision to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammerscitation needed groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group including most talked about discussions within your professional circles groups may be private accessible to members only or may be open to internet users in general to read though they must join in order to post messages in december

opportunity he or she may have recruiters also often join industry based groups on linkedin to create connections with professionals in that line of business skillsedit since september  linkedin has enabled users to endorse each others skills this feature also allows users to efficiently provide commentary on other users profiles – network building is reinforced however there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content linkedin solicits endorsements using algorithms that generate skills members might have members cannot opt out of such solicitations with the result that it sometimes appears that a member is soliciting an endorsement for a nonexistent skill publishing platformedit linkedin continues to add different services to its platform to expand the ways that people use it on may   linkedin added an analytics tool to its publishing platform the tool allows authors to better track traffic that their posts receive influencersedit the linkedin influencers

a common way for social media sites such as linkedin to generate revenue future plansedit economic graphedit inspired by facebooks social graph linkedin ceo jeff weiner set a goal in  to create an economic graph within a decade the goal is to create a comprehensive digital map of the world economy and the connections within it the economic graph was to be built on the companys current platform with data nodes including companies jobs skills volunteer opportunities educational institutions and content they have been hoping to include all the job listings in the world all the skills required to get those jobs all the professionals who could fill them and all the companies nonprofit and forprofit at which they work the ultimate goal is to make the world economy and job market more efficient through increased transparency in june  the company announced its galene search architecture to give users access to the economic graphs data with more thorough filtering of data via user searches like engineers with hadoop experience in brazil linkedin has used economic graph data to research several topics on the job market including popular destination cities of recent college graduates areas with high concentrations of technology skills and common career transitions linkedin provided the city of new york with data from economic graph showing indemand tech skills for the citys tech talent pipeline project new user interface in edit soon after linkedins acquisition by microsoft on january   linkedins new desktop version was introduced the new version was meant to make the user experience seamless across mobile and desktop some of the changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app features that were not heavily used were removed for example the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported any more users reactionedit following the launch of the new interface some users including blogger zubair abbas complained about missing features which were there in the older version slowness and bugs in the ui the issues were faced by both free and premium users and with both the desktop version and the mobile version of the site dropped features in edit in january  linkedin dropped support for linkedin answers and cited a new focus on development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss

users can learn various skills related to their job function or personal learning goals on the lyndacom or linkedin learning platforms some elements of the various subscription services are also on a pay per use basis like inmaildefinition needed receptionedit linkedin has been described by online trade publication techrepublic as having become the de facto tool for professional networking linkedin has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships linkedin is far and away the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today according to forbes linkedin has also received criticism primarily regarding email address mining and autoupdate the signup process includes a step for entering your email password there is an optout feature linkedin will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in your address book or that you have had email conversation with when the members email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to selected email addresses or to all up to  invitations can then be sent out in one click with no possibility to undo or withdraw them linkedin was sued for sending out another two followup invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation in november  linkedin lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of peoples names and images without authorization the lawsuit was eventually settled in  in favor of linkedin members changing the description below a members name is seen as a change in a job title even if it is just a wording change or even a change to unemployed unless a member opts to turn off activity updates an update is sent to all of that persons contacts telling them to congratulate the member on the new job the feature that allows linkedin members to endorse each others skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the members skills in october  linkedin acknowledged that it really does matter who endorsed you and began highlighting endorsements from coworkers and other mutual connections to address the criticism in  the catalan language advocacy organization fundació puntcat launched an online campaign asking linkedin to support the language both in the platforms interface and as cv language it gained more than  online signatures in  plataforma per la llengua started another campaign asking for such a change international restrictionsedit in  syrian users

leading elite officially extending their service in china linkedin ceo jeff weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in

blocked in russia for violating a new data retention law which requires the user data of russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country this ban was upheld on  november  and all russian

linkedin has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships linkedin is far and away the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today according to forbes linkedin has also received criticism primarily regarding email address mining and autoupdate the signup process includes a step for entering your email password there is an optout feature linkedin will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in your address book or that you have had email conversation with when the members email address book

with no possibility to undo or withdraw them linkedin was sued for sending out another two followup invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation in november  linkedin lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use

even if it is just a wording change or even a change to unemployed unless a member opts to turn off activity updates an update is sent to all of that persons contacts telling them to congratulate the

third party applications that interact with linkedins developer api however in some cases it could refer to sanctioned applications featured on a users profile page external third party applicationsedit on february   linkedin released an updated terms of use for their developer api the developer api allows both companies and individuals the ability to interact with linkedins data through creation of managed third party applications applications must go through a review process and request permission from the user before accessing a users data normal use of the api is outlined in linkedins developer documents including sign into external services using linkedin add items or attributes to a user profile share items or articles to users timeline on a more rare occasion applications have been developed by third parties to extend linkedins native functions for instance linkedin does not allow users to define images that correlate with articles or links they share but this can be done using a third party application like linkedin advanced share embedded in profileedit in october  linkedin enabled an applications platform which allows external online services to be embedded within a members profile page among the initial applications were an amazon reading list that allows linkedin members to display books they are reading a connection to tripit and a six apart wordpress and typepad application that allows members to display their latest blog postings within their linkedin profile in november  linkedin allowed businesses to list products and services on company profile pages it also permitted linkedin members to recommend products and services and write reviews shortly after some of the external services were no longer supported including amazons reading list  mobileedit a mobile version of the site was launched in february  which gives access to a reduced feature set over a mobile phone the mobile service is available in six languages chinese english french german japanese and spanish in january  linkedin acquired cardmunch a mobile app maker that scans business cards and converts into contacts in june  cardmunch was noted as an available linkedin app in august  linkedin revamped its mobile applications on the iphone android and html at the time mobile page views of the application were increasing roughly  year over year according to ceo jeff weiner in october  linkedin announced a service for iphone users called intro which inserts a thumbnail of a persons linkedin profile in correspondence with that person when reading mail messages in the native ios mail program this is accomplished by rerouting all emails from and to the iphone through linkedin servers which security firm bishop fox asserts has serious privacy implications violates many organizations security policies and resembles a maninthemiddle attack groupsedit linkedin also supports the formation of interest groups and as of march   there are  such groups whose membership varies from  to  the majority of the largest groups are employment related although a very wide range of topics are covered mainly around professional and career issues and there are currentlywhen  groups for both academic and corporate alumnicitation needed groups support a limited form of discussion area moderated by the group owners and managers since groups offer the functionality to reach a wide audience without so easily falling foul of antispam solutions there is a constant stream of spam postings and there now exist a range of firms who offer a spamming service for this very purpose linkedin has devised a few mechanisms to reduce the volume of spam but recentlywhen took the decision to remove the ability of group owners to inspect the email address of new members in order to determine if they were spammerscitation needed groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group including most talked about discussions within your professional circles groups may be private accessible to members only or may be open to internet users in general to read though they must join in order to post messages in december  linkedin announced that they are rolling out polls to groups in november  linkedin announced the addition of showcase pages to the platform in  linkedin announced they were going to be removing product and services pages paving the way for a greater focus on showcase pages job listingsedit linkedin allows users to research companies nonprofit organizations and governments they may be interested in working for typing the name of a company or organization in the search box causes popup data about the company or organization to appear such data may include the ratio of female to male employees the percentage of the most common titlespositions held within the company the location of the companys headquarters and offices and a list of present and former employees in july  linkedin launched a new feature allowing companies to include an apply with linkedin button on job listing pages the new plugin allowed potential employees to apply for positions using their linkedin profiles as resumes online recruitingedit job recruiters head hunters and personnel hr are increasingly using linkedin as a source for finding potential candidates by using the advanced search tools recruiters can find members matching their specific key words with a click of a button they then can make contact with those members by sending a request to connect or by sending inmail about a specific job opportunity he or she may have recruiters also often join industry based groups on linkedin to create connections with professionals in that line of business skillsedit since september  linkedin has enabled users to endorse each others skills this feature also allows users to efficiently provide commentary on other users profiles – network building is reinforced however there is no way of flagging anything other than positive content linkedin solicits endorsements using algorithms that generate skills members might have members cannot opt out of such solicitations with the result that it sometimes appears that a member is soliciting an endorsement for a nonexistent skill publishing platformedit linkedin continues to add different services to its platform to expand the ways that people use it on may   linkedin added an analytics tool to its publishing platform the tool allows authors to better track traffic that their posts receive influencersedit the linkedin influencers program launched in october  and features global thought leaders who share their professional insights with linkedins members as of may  there are  influencers approximately  of which are male the program is inviteonly and features leaders from a range of industries including richard branson narendra modi arianna huffington greg mckeown rahm emanuel jamie dimon martha stewart deepak chopra jack welch and bill gates advertising and forpay researchedit in mid linkedin launched linkedin directads as a form of sponsored advertising in october  linkedin revealed plans to open its social network of  million professionals globally as a potential sample for businesstobusiness research it is testing a potential social network revenue model  research that to some appears more promising than advertising on july   linkedin announced their sponsored updates ad service individuals and companies can now pay a fee to have linkedin sponsor their content and spread it to their user base this is a common way for social media sites such as linkedin to generate revenue future plansedit economic graphedit inspired by facebooks social graph linkedin ceo jeff weiner set a goal in  to create an economic graph within a decade the goal is to create a comprehensive digital map of the world economy and the connections within it the economic graph was to be built on the companys current platform with data nodes including companies jobs skills volunteer opportunities educational institutions and content they have been hoping to include all the job listings in the world all the skills required to get those jobs all the professionals who could fill them and all the companies nonprofit and forprofit at which they work the ultimate goal is to make the world economy and job market more efficient through increased transparency in june  the company announced its galene search architecture to give users access to the economic graphs data with more thorough filtering of data via user searches like engineers with hadoop experience in brazil linkedin has used economic graph data to research several topics on the job market including popular destination cities of recent college graduates areas with high concentrations of technology skills and common career transitions linkedin provided the city of new york with data from economic graph showing indemand tech skills for the citys tech talent pipeline project new user interface in edit soon after linkedins acquisition by microsoft on january   linkedins new desktop version was introduced the new version was meant to make the user experience seamless across mobile and desktop some of the changes were made according to the feedback received from the previously launched mobile app features that were not heavily used were removed for example the contact tagging and filtering features are not supported any more users reactionedit following the launch of the new interface some users including blogger zubair abbas complained about missing features which were there in the older version slowness and bugs in the ui the issues were faced by both free and premium users and with both the desktop version and the mobile version of the site dropped features in edit in january  linkedin dropped support for linkedin answers and cited a new focus on development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss professional topics across linkedin as the reason for the retirement of the feature the feature had been launched in  and allowed users to post question to their network and allowed users to rank answers business unitsedit linkedin derives its revenues from four business divisions talent solutions through which recruiters and corporations pay for branded corporation and career listing pages payperclick targeted job ads and access to the linkedin database of users and resumes marketing solutions which advertisers pay for pay per clickthrough targeted ads premium subscriptions through which linkedin users can pay for advanced services such as linkedin business linkedin talent for recruiters linkedin jobseeker and linkedin sales for sales professions learning solutions through which users can learn various skills related to their job function or personal learning goals on the lyndacom or linkedin learning platforms some elements of the various subscription services are also on a pay per use basis like inmaildefinition needed receptionedit linkedin has been described by online trade publication techrepublic as having become the de facto tool for professional networking linkedin has also been praised for its usefulness in fostering business relationships linkedin is far and away the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today according to forbes linkedin has also received criticism primarily regarding email address mining and autoupdate the signup process includes a step for entering your email password there is an optout feature linkedin will then offer to send out contact invitations to all members in your address book or that you have had email conversation with when the members email address book is opened it is opened with all email addresses selected and the member is advised invitations will be sent to selected email addresses or to all up to  invitations can then be sent out in one click with no possibility to undo or withdraw them linkedin was sued for sending out another two followup invitations to each contact from members to link to friends who had ignored the initial authorized invitation in november  linkedin lost a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in a ruling that the invitations were advertisements not broadly protected by free speech rights that would otherwise permit use of peoples names and images without authorization the lawsuit was eventually settled in  in favor of linkedin members changing the description below a members name is seen as a change in a job title even if it is just a wording change or even a change to unemployed unless a member opts to turn off activity updates an update is sent to all of that persons contacts telling them to congratulate the member on the new job the feature that allows linkedin members to endorse each others skills and experience has been criticized as meaningless since the endorsements are not necessarily accurate or given by people who have familiarity with the members skills in october  linkedin acknowledged that it really does matter who endorsed you and began highlighting endorsements from coworkers and other mutual connections to address the criticism in  the catalan language advocacy organization fundació puntcat launched an online campaign asking linkedin to support the language both in the platforms interface and as cv language it gained more than  online signatures in  plataforma per la llengua started another campaign asking for such a change international restrictionsedit in  syrian users reported that linkedin server stopped accepting connections originating from ip addresses assigned to syria the companys customer support stated that services provided by them are subject to us export and reexport control laws and regulations and as such and as a matter of corporate policy we do not allow member accounts or access to our site from cuba iran north korea sudan or syria in february  it was reported that linkedin was being blocked in china after calls for a jasmine revolution it was speculated to have been blocked because it is an easy way for dissidents to access twitter which had been blocked previously after a day of being blocked linkedin access was restored in china in february  linkedin launched its simplified chinese language version named  pinyin lǐngyīng literally leading elite officially extending their service in china linkedin ceo jeff weiner acknowledged in a blog post that they would have to censor some of the content that users post on its website in order to comply with chinese rules but he also said the benefits of providing its online service to people in china outweighed those concerns on  august  a moscow court ruled that linkedin must be blocked in russia for violating a new data retention law which requires the user data of russian citizens to be stored on servers within the country this ban was upheld on  november  and all russian isps began blocking linkedin thereafter linkedins mobile app was also banned from google play store and ios app store in russia in january  sna linkedinedit the search network and analytics sna team
