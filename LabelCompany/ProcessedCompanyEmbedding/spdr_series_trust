value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market although subject to the risks of common stocks low volatility stocks are seen as having a lower risk profile than the overall markets however a fund that invests in low volatility stocks may not produce investment exposure that has lower variability to changes in such stocks price levels a

interest rates actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments illiquidity in debt securities markets and prepayments of principal which often must be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates investing in high yield fixed income securities otherwise known as junk bonds is considered

price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer increase in real interest rates can cause the price of inflationprotected debt securities to decrease  interest payments on inflationprotected debt securities can be unpredictable investments in asset backed and mortgage backed securities are subject to prepayment risk which can limit the potential for gain during a declining interest rate environment and increases the potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate shortterm price

such that they may offset any savings from low fees or costs the values of debt securities may decrease as a result of many factors including by way of example general market fluctuations increases in interest rates actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments illiquidity in debt securities markets and prepayments of principal which often must be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates investing in high yield fixed income securities otherwise known as junk bonds is considered speculative and involves greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investing in investment grade fixed income securities these lowerquality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer increase in real interest rates can cause the price of inflationprotected debt securities to decrease  interest payments on inflationprotected debt securities can be unpredictable investments in asset backed and mortgage backed securities are subject to prepayment risk which can limit the potential for gain during a declining interest rate environment and increases the potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate shortterm price fluctuations than stocks but provide lower potential longterm returns foreign investments involve greater risks than us investments including political and economic risks and the risk of currency
