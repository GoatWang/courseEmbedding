longshort equity strategy multimanager firm builds on its microcap and small cap manager research expertise to offer absolute return strategy november    pm eastern standard time seattlebusiness wireacuitas investments llc an investment firm offering multimanager solutions in microcap and nonus small cap markets has launched a longshort equity strategy the company announced today the firm’s investment philosophy centers on exploiting the return opportunities available in the least efficient areas of the equity markets acuitas’s longshort strategy seeks to deliver high absolute returns with low correlation to equity markets building on the firm’s expertise in researching microcap and small cap managers “underfollowed areas of the equity markets such as microcap offer opportunities for skilled investors to generate an information advantage and deliver strong returns this is the basis for acuitas’s exclusive focus on microcap and small cap markets globally implementing in a longshort strategy enhances managers’ ability to exploit these return opportunities through their ability to short” said chris tessin managing partner at acuitas with equity volatility rising but many investors expecting lower returns from traditional investments acuitas believes market participants are increasingly looking for unique sources of returns with less volatility and low correlations to their existing portfolios the firm’s longshort product is a multimanager strategy intended for plan sponsors endowments wealth managers and other institutional investors it will be offered in a commingled vehicle as well as in separate accounts for larger investors acuitas’s research indicates that microcap and small cap stocks remain an “undiscovered” asset class according to the firm of the estimated  publicly traded securities with market caps under  billion and at least  average trading volume traded globally over  percent have no sellside analytical coverage acuitas believes this gives skilled professional investors an opportunity to generate an informational advantage that will result in strong returns “in the inefficient areas we target it is critical to identify great managers early in their life cycle when assets are low and their ability to generate returns is the greatest” said dennis jensen the company’s director of research “offering a returnfocused longshort product with limited net market exposure is a natural extension of the work we do for our existing strategies as we have been researching longshort managers as part of our investment process since our founding in ” to identify potential managers acuitas employs a fundamental research process supplemented by quantitative analysis while also taking into account the unique qualities of the capacityconstrained asset classes the research includes a comprehensive analysis of the manager’s investment process philosophy management team and risk controls “our goal is to identify strong alphafocused managers before they turn up on other institutional investors’ radar screens” added jensen “we’ve done this with our longonly products and we utilize this same approach in the longshort space” about acuitas investments llc based in seattle washington acuitas investments llc is a boutique investment management firm providing access to capacity constrained inefficient areas of the equity markets through its multimanager platform acuitas is built on the pillars of exceptional research and a focus on investment excellence in inefficient markets the firm’s investment team seeks to
