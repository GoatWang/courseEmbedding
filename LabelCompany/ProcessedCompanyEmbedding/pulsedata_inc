and brought braille back in to my world in a new way for myself one of the most thrilling concepts about me and my braillenote is the idea that the braille world which i thought i had lost has come back alive and will always be part of me how i work and who i am the braillenote allows me to be competitive and still keep using braille to eternity i am looking forward to exploring many more uses i have still not touched upon for my braillenote some day should i need to get an iphone the good part will be that i’ll be able to use it with my braillenote   jessica snyder i am thankful that the wireless internet process has been simplified and now such book formats as national library service digital books and audible are recognized by this outstanding machine with every new model of this impressive note taker the features i have come to rely on are only improved upon and the new features allow for even more accessibility to the ever changing technology of this day and age   sarah

formulas or concepts to refer to later and ensures i have access to all visual material such as graphs that i might miss in lecture this resource is invaluable and id be lost without it   virginia miller my student was a braille reader but a very slow one and we were supposed to increase his reading speed as one of his goals we started using the braille note to talk back and forth and then he was able to obtain a braille note with a qwerty keyboard this gave him so much more independence when out in the community as he could write a message use the speech to talk to someone and they could respond by typing a message on the standard keyboard and he could read the braille display   featured products braillenote touch  braille notetaker  tablet  explorē  handheld electronic magnifier
