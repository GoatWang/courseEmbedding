patent litigation pending in the united states district court for the district of delaware involving us patent no  the  patent  harris corporation  harris  is an international communications and information technology company that inter alia manufactures and sells transmission equipment for digital and hdtv broadcasting in doing so it has employed technology that plaintiff rembrandt technologies ld  rembrandt  alleges is covered by its  patent as the litigation has evolved the parties now agree that rembrandt must grant harris a license to the  patent but they disagree as to the appropriate reasonable and nondiscriminatory  rand  terms of such license both parties seek a declaration of the court setting the rand terms of the license before the court is defendant harris corporation s motion to compel production of documents withheld by rembrandt technologies on the basis of improper privilege claims harris motion seeks an order compelling production of  documents rembrandt withheld all of the documents from production based on claims of attorneyclient privilege andor attorney work product immunity furthermore rembrandt asserts that  of the challenged documents in addition to the aboveclaimed protections are not responsive to pending document requests  because they are not related to the  patent harris disputes the legal predicates upon which rembrandt s objections to production rest harris motion challenges those legal predicates in a broad sense without embarking on a documentbydocument remonstration the motion has been fully briefed and presented with oral argument the court has conducted an inspection of rembrandt s supplemental privilege logs and an in camera review of a document singled out by the parties as representative of the universe of documents at issue the court finds that rembrandt s objections on the grounds of attorneyclient privilege common interest doctrine and work product immunity at least conceptually are well founded rembrandt s objection on relevancy grounds need not be addressed given the court s ruling on the attorneyclient privilege and work product issues the court will consider documentbydocument challenges to rembrandt s objections in keeping with the parameters laid out in this opinion should harris file an appropriate motion for now defendant s motion is denied ii a the relationship between

withheld on the basis of attorneyclient privilege and work product immunity the documents harris seeks to compel involve various communications between representatives of westerlunddowling rembrandt paradyne and their respective counsel relating in various degrees to the  patent the motion was complicated by the fact that the documents at issue were withheld from production in a prior federal court litigation in texas between rembrandt and other parties  rembrandt which is represented by different counsel in this case initially produced a privilege log to harris that was prepared by its prior counsel in the texas litigation due to prior texas counsel s agreement to strictly limit the disclosure of withheld documents however rembrandt through its current counsel encountered difficulty in securing physical access to these documents additionally rembrandt through its current counsel expressed a concern that access to the documents in question could create a conflict of interest potentially disqualifying rembrandt s current counsel in another matter rembrandt  di  at  letter from pl s counsel to the court  id  di  at  letter from pl s counsel to the court  resolved these complications by obtaining an order from this court compelling production of the withheld documents to rembrandt s delaware counsel and then by engaging an outside firm otherwise uninvolved in this litigation to review the challenged documents on behalf of rembrandt for the purpose of determining whether they are subject to privilege the outside firm smith katzenstein prepared a privilege log responsive to the document requests at issue here this privilege log catalogs the withheld documents and describes each document s contents senders recipients and the protections claimed as a result of the document review three  of the  documents previously withheld from production have now been produced to harris additionally rembrandt has removed  of the documents from the privilege log as irrelevant having determined that they pertain to patents not at issue in this litigation rembrandt continues to withhold from production  purportedly privileged documents and invokes attorneyclient privilege the common interest doctrine and work product immunity as to all of the  challenged documents harris argues that the withheld documents should be produced in their entirety on several grounds first harris alleges that rembrandt has offered no basis to justify  see di  at  n pl s supp mem noting that documents   and  have been produced to harris  id at  di  at  noting that the privilege log originally produced to harris was compiled in a prior litigation involving four rembrandt patents only one of which is at issue in this litigation  the unilateral removal of the  documents it now claims are irrelevant to this litigation next harris argues that none of the challenged documents are protected by attorneyclient privilege under the common interest doctrine or otherwise or work product immunity even if some of the challenged documents are deemed protected by attorneyclient privilege or work product immunity harris claims that subsequent disclosure of these documents to third parties constitutes a waiver of those privileges lastly harris asserts the existence of a particularized need for document  in category  of rembrandt s supplemental privilege log

product immunity this claim will be addressed below  harris argues that no relationship exists among any of the parties upon which the attorneyclient privilege may be based harris contends that contrary to rembrandt s insistence the attorneyclient privilege does not attach to communications simply because westerlund an attorney was involved somehow in the communications in support of this argument harris points to the definitive agreements between westerlund dowling and rembrandt which specifically provide that neither westerlund nor dowling would render legal services to rembrandt or vice versa additionally harris argues that the rules governing professional responsibility in each of the three states in which westerlund is admitted to practice law prohibit him from forming a partnership with a nonlawyer for the purpose of providing legal advice the attorneyclient privilege the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law  recognizes the extraordinary importance of encouraging full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients  the privilege allows the attorney and client to predict with some  di  at exhibits l  m

are afforded absolute and complete protection from disclosure  strict adherence to this rule is justified because an uncertain privilege or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts is little better than no privilege at all  as noted previously the party asserting attorneyclient privilege bears the burden of establishing each of its necessary elements the party must show that a communication was made  for the purpose of seeking obtaining or delivering legal advice  between privileged persons and  that confidentiality was intended unlike the work product doctrine discussed below the attorneyclient privilege is not premised on a requirement that the communications between the attorney and client occur in anticipation of litigation in other words it is well established that the  id  us at   hanson v united states  fd   th cir  quoting in re allen  fd   th cir  upjohn  us at   continental casualty co  wl  at  citing hoechst celanese

properly said to be termed the subject of a confidential disclosure  under the delaware rules of evidence a communication is considered confidential when disclosure to third parties is not intended other than those to whom disclosure is made in furtherance of the rendition of professional legal services to the client or to those reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication  it follows then that not all communications between an attorney and client will be privileged for example the presence of a lawyer at a business meeting called to consider a problem that has legal

the affidavits of meli westerlund and bremer demonstrate the existence of an attorneyclient relationship between the following pairings dowling and westerlund meli and rembrandt and attorneys from the thk  r firm and paradyne therefore communications between each of these pairings that were intended to be confidential and made for the purposes of seeking or delivering legal advice are privileged

hercules v exxon corp  fsupp   d del  citing burlington ind v exxon corp  frd  d md   harris argument that westerlund s role as legal counsel on behalf of the consulting partnership was in violation of the rules governing attorney professional conduct is without merit the rules in each of the jurisdictions in which westerlund is admitted to practice clearly permit a lawyer to take on the role of corporate counsel representing an organization as a whole see ca rules of prof l conduct r  la rules of prof l conduct r  va rules of prof l conduct r  the court is also unpersuaded by harris argument that the sections in the definitive agreements disclaiming the provision of legal services between the parties support the notion that an attorneyclient relationship did not exist as between the pairings discussed above rembrandt makes no claim that the attorneyclient privilege attaches to westerlund s provision of legal services directly to either rembrandt or paradyne  communication but the general proposition is not dispositive here the case law is equally clear that a request for legal advice need not be express and an incidental request for business advice made in conjunction with a communication primarily ¦soliciting legal advice does not destroy the attorneyclient privilege this is because as may well be true in the current case business and legal advice may often be inextricably interwoven a single proposed course of conduct such as patenting and licensing of an invention will have both legal and business ramifications and the lawyer may advise as to both in a single communication  indeed communications with respect to patent prosecution or litigation matters may be protected regardless of whether the attorney is outside counsel house counsel or patent department counsel based on the foregoing the court is satisfied that rembrandt has established a sufficient factual predicate for its assertion that an attorneyclient relationship existed between the pairings as identified herein such that a claim of privlege can be advanced at this time the court will not undertake the task of sifting through the several hundred documents listed on rembrandt s privilege log to determine whether the attorneyclient privilege applies to each document neither party has requested  hercules  fsupp at   id  id at   that the court undertake this exercise and the court sees no reason to do so at this time without further direction and guidance from the parties c the common interest doctrine the vast majority of documents on rembrandt s privilege log were shared not only among the attorneyclient pairings discussed above but also were later shared with representatives andor attorneys of rembrandt paradyne and westerlunddowling rembrandt claims that these challenged documents maintain their attorneyclient privilege protection because they were exchanged among the parties in order to further a common legal interest the enforcement and exploitation of paradyne patents therefore rembrandt urges the court to apply the common interest doctrine effectively extending the protections afforded by the attorneyclient privilege to documents shared among members of the community of interest harris on the other hand argues that any underlying attorneyclient privilege which may have been demonstrated by rembrandt as among the attorneyclient pairings was  the court takes note of harris argument that generic references to paradyne and rembrandt as recipients of documents authored by westerlund or dowling do not allow harris or the court to properly evaluate its assertion of privilege di  letter to court from harris december   in fact rembrandt begins its supplemental privilege log with a list of relevant individuals in each organization see di  at exhibit p for example individuals acting as representatives of rembrandt include john meli esq cassandra mccloskey eric brooks harris london and paul schneck id the court reads references in the privilege log citing generally to rembrandt or paradyne to include all of those individuals listed as representatives on the privilege log indeed communications that involve only some of these individuals list them as separate recipients such as document  which was authored by robert westerlund esq and received only by three rembrandt representatives cassandra mccloskey john meli esq and paul schneck id  waived when communications included third parties or were subsequently disclosed to third parties in addition harris contends that no common interest can exist among rembrandt westerlunddowling and paradyne prior to the memorialization of the parties agreements by written contract finally harris contends that the parties can claim no common legal interest as they were merely involved in and communicating about a proposed business arrangement ordinarily disclosure of confidential attorneyclient communications to a third party constitutes a waiver of the attorney client privilege for example a statement or communication made by a client to his attorney with the intent and purpose that it be communicated to others is not privileged  because this signals that the client did not intend to keep the communication secret  the socalled common interest doctrine however as set forth by the delaware rules of evidence recognizes that a client has a privilege to protect from disclosure confidential communications made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the client by the client or the client s representative or the client s lawyer or a representative of the lawyer to a lawyer or a representative of a lawyer representing another in a matter of common interest  fresenius medical care holdings v roxane labs  wl  at

enterprise and the legal advice relates to the goal of that enterprise ¦the parties are permitted to share privileged information without a waiver occurring  evidence that the parties legal interests are substantially similar is sufficient to invoke the common interest doctrine in this case the court finds that the common legal interest binding rembrandt paradyne and westerlunddowling was their agreement to enforce and exploit the paradyne patents through litigation the affidavits of meli westerlund and bremer in addition to the numerous contracts and agreements entered by rembrandt paradyne and westerlunddowling clearly document the parties intent that their communications be kept confidential the affidavits aver that the parties intended to establish a common interest within which their communications would be protected by the attorneyclient privilege although some of the communications at issue took place before some of the written confidentiality agreements were signed the court  fresenius  wl  at   see teleglobe  fd at  in re regents of the university of california  fd   th cir   id the court notes however that the common interest doctrine under these circumstances extends only to communications relating to the prosecution and litigation of the patents and not to those communications relating to the parties rights among themselves in the patents see baxter travenol labs

would have been adverse rather than common  rejects harris contention that no common legal interest may exist prior to the execution of written documents between the parties a confidentiality agreement underlying a common interest claim need not be in writing an oral agreement ¦later memorialized in writing as occurred here can provide the platform upon which the common interest can rest harris suggests that the common interest doctrine is inapplicable in this case because many of the challenged communications were shared directly between community members instead of through their respective attorneys thus waiving the attorneyclient privilege in response rembrandt contends that when each member of the community of interest is separately represented by and is under the close supervision of legal counsel the common interest doctrine allows at least limited clienttoclient communications regarding matters of common legal interest the court agrees while it is true that courts have suggested in certain circumstances that direct communications among members of the community of interest may destroy the privilege harris has offered no principled reason why in this case persons who  see american legacy foundation v lorrilard tobacco company  wl  at  del ch  see eg teleglobe  fd at  indicating that a member s sharing information directly with another member of the community may destroy the privilege  emphasis supplied  share a common interest in litigation should not be able to communicate with their respective attorneys and with each other to more effectively prosecute or defend their claims  simply stated a privileged communication should not lose its protection if an executive relays legal advice to another who shares responsibility for the subject matter underlying the consultation  in the absence of any reason to impose a restriction on communications between members of the community of interest it seems unecessarily burdensome to require that the decision makers within the community of interest cannot communicate with each other regarding legal advice they received from their attorneys but must instead funnel those communications through the

ground that the attorney was not retained as a lawyer but rather as a construction consultant to observe dispute negotiations id while the consultant was educated as an engineer and had extensive experience in many facets of the construction industry it was also clear that he was a lawyer held bar membership in several states and had extensive experience in dispute resolution and other lawrelated tasks id the court found that the consultant was clearly retained due to his unique combination of skills as a lawyer who could bring both his legal ¦and construction expertise to the job

the close supervision of counsel communicate directly with one another regarding that shared interest in this case rembrandt paradyne and westerlunddowling each were represented by separate counsel the supplemental privilege log seems to reflect that the majority of communications involved counsel for at least one of the parties as either a recipient or sender conversely it appears that the minority of documents were shared directly between community members without involvement of counsel the court already has determined that the parties share a common legal interest in the exploitation and enforcement of the  patent in addition the court has determined that valid attorneyclient relationships between the parties and their respective legal counsel support an underlying privilege the court is satisfied that this privilege may be extended to communications among the community of interest if the communications relate to that common interest the court has not yet taken this broader holding and applied it to each of the hundreds of documents in the privilege log if harris is of the view that certain documents fall outside of the parameters discussed herein it may seek to compel production of such documents in a separate motion  for example document   for example document   d the work product doctrine rembrandt contends that the work product doctrine protects  of the challenged documents harris however argues that the work product doctrine does not apply because rembrandt has failed to identify any specific litigation for which the documents were prepared the work product doctrine safeguards the adversary system of litigation by assuring an attorney that his private file shall except in unusual circumstances remain free from the encroachments of opposing counsel  despite the underlying similarities between the attorneyclient privilege and the work product doctrine the latter is distinct from and broader than the attorneyclient privilege  unlike the attorneyclient privilege which must be asserted by the client the right to assert the work product barrier to disclosure belongs in large part to the attorney ¦and affords additional protection ¦from unfair disclosure  the privilege afforded by the work product doctrine is limited by the requirement that the document be prepared with an eye toward litigation  thus  bristolmyers co v sigma chemical

point to specific litigation anticipated at the time of the communication this assertion is incorrect the protection afforded by the work product doctrine is not limited to materials prepared in
