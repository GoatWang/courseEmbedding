default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome

  a word about risk because each fund pursues its own unique investment objectives each fund has its own set of risks which are fully discussed in its prospectus in order to achieve their investment objectives some funds may at times use certain types of investment derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps these instruments involve risks different from and in certain cases greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments for funds that can invest in foreign securities which may include emerging markets securities risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries portfolios that hold a smaller number of securities may be more volatile than more diversified portfolios short sale risk the strategy may not always be able to close out a short position on favorable terms short sales involve the risk that the strategy will incur a loss by subsequently buying a security at a higher price than the price at which it sold the security short the amount of such loss is theoretically unlimited since it is limited only by the increase in value of the security sold short by the strategy in contrast the risk of loss from a long position is limited to the strategy’s investment in the long position since its value cannot fall below zero short selling is a form of leverage to mitigate leverage risk the strategy will always hold liquid assets including its long positions at least equal to its short position exposure markedtomarket daily funds that invest in smallcap and midcap stocks are often more volatile than largecap stocks—smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines markets and financial resources funds that invest in real estate are subject to a variety of factors affecting the real estate market such as economic conditions mortgage rates and availability which can cause the value of such investments to decline reits may have additional risks due to limited diversification and the impact of tax law changes investors should consider the investment objectives risks

of mar   developed equity markets outside the us as measured by the msci eafe index were up  in the first quarter driven by signs of recovery in the eurozone and positive earnings news out of japan this rally was consistent across the quarter wi th the index rising over each month in the quarter additionally the dollar gave up all of its gains to finish down nearly  with the dollar index near its lows of the year this drop benefited nonus returns when translated into us dollar terms all twentyone countries in the index posted positive returns over the quarter as the improvement in business confidence was reflected in their stock prices the best performing countries were spain and singapore norwegian markets were least positive fo r the period due in part to continued softness in energy prices negative unemployment data and persistently slow economic growth energy was the only sector out of eleven gic sectors for the period with a negative return as oil prices slipped on reports of a substantial rise in us crude oil inventories the top performing sectors were information technology consumer cyclicals an d health care as the market favored growth oriented areas performance summary  parametric international equity fund the fund outperformed the index for the quarter ended march   returning  for the investor shares at net asset value versus the indexs  return the funds emphasis on diversification via a system of country target weights had a modestly positive impact on performance relative to the index the diversification targets consistently position the fund underweight large countries and overweight smaller countries within each country diversification among sectors is also maintained via a set of sector target weights during the first quarter the sector diversification process was a modest contributor to relative performance in addition the funds emphasis on diversification via a system of broad security representation with an emphasis on reducing portfolio risk was a minor contributor to the funds outperformance versus the index historical returns as of mar   annualized  mo  mos ytd  yr  yrs  yrs life of fund fund at nav        msci eafe index        past

compared to the index during the quarter our underweight to japan was the largest contributor to relative returns as japan equities underperformed in part due to diminished hopes of a trumpled economic boom which had negative implications for this exportled economy in italy the inclusion of smallcap names in many sectors such as health care telecommunications and industrials were boosted as italian equity shares recovered on signs that italian banks may be able to restructure and avoid insolvency in switzerland the inclusion of smallcap names in information technology contributed to relative returns detractors  factors detracting from the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter in sweden inclusion of non index holdings including smallcap names in many sectors detracted from relative returns in part the underperformance was due to the removal of highbeta stocks which fared better as the swedish market hit an alltime hi gh in february our overweight to norway hurt relative returns as norwegian markets continued underperform in the face of slow economic growth and continued weakness in energy prices the inclusion of small cap names in australia also detracted from relative performance investment outlook and fund positioning  against a backdrop of improving confidence in the economic outlook for the global economy equities may experience a host of marketmoving events in the coming months such as the start of brexit negotiations french elections and italys huge debt furth er there are the implications for likely us economic and foreign policy changes under president trump how does one invest in this space with so much shortterm uncertainty we believe that managing risk by broadly diversifying avoiding concentrations and portfolio rebalancing are all key aspects that help address thoughtful investment decisions paramet rics developed international equity investment strategy relies on a rules based approach in combination with a

bond fund join russell taxmanaged model strategies boosting each model’s allocation to taxaware funds to greater than  june    am eastern daylight time seattlebusiness wirein an effort to provide financial advisors with multiasset investment solutions that seek to deliver higher aftertax returns to their clients global asset manager russell investments has expanded its taxmanaged fund lineup with the introduction of the russell taxmanaged international equity fund and the russell tax exempt high yield bond fund the two new funds will be incorporated into russell investments’ taxmanaged model strategies in june as part of an overall strategic asset reallocation of the five model portfolios that will result in each model portfolio’s allocation to taxaware funds exceeding  “tax management is an important topic for investors and for more than three decades russell investments has provided taxaware investment solutions that help advisors and their clients minimize their tax exposure and maximize their investment dollars” said phill rogerson managing director consulting and product for russell investments’ us advisorsold business “with investors and their advisors more focused than ever on outcomes such as financial security in retirement every dollar saved in taxes is one that can be put toward an investor’s goals it’s precisely for this reason that we expanded the suite of investment solutions that can help investors grow their aftertax wealth more efficiently” for advisors looking to help clients grow aftertax wealth russell investments offers several ways to access its taxmanaged capabilities including total portfolio solutions russell taxmanaged model strategies individual funds focused on us large cap mid and small cap and tax exempt bonds as well as the two new funds focused on international equities and taxexempt high yield the new russell taxmanaged international equity fund is currently one of the only taxmanaged multimanager international equity mutual funds available to investors it seeks to deliver longterm capital growth on an aftertax basis and invests principally in depositary receipts and equity securities issued by companies economically tied to nonus countries in both developed and emerging markets jon eggins senior portfolio manager at russell investments manages the new fund which employs a range of taxmanagement strategies including managing holding periods and yield taxlot swapping taxloss harvesting minimizing wash sales and more as appropriate “taxmanaged investing today is more than just municipal bonds and us stocks it’s now available globally” said eggins “developed and emerging markets are accessible in one fund which provides uncommon taxmanaged access to emerging markets typically it is more taxefficient to combine subasset classes that are not perfectly correlated as it increases opportunities for taxloss harvesting in one to offset gains in another” the russell tax exempt high yield bond fund is a multimanager fund providing access to taxexempt high yield municipal debt securities kevin lo serves as portfolio manager for the fund which recognizes that high yield bonds have historically produced taxequivalent returns similar to equities at half of the volatility albeit with some increased risk and is designed to create an opportunity for higher taxexempt income by investing  of its assets in municipal bonds that are ‘below investment grade’ the primary purpose of the fund is to provide a high level of current income that is taxexempt but it will also focus on providing total return strategic asset reallocation in the russell taxmanaged model strategies russell taxmanaged model strategies offer broad diversification access to some of the world’s leading managers and strategies and dynamic portfolio management the strategic asset reallocation of the portfolios effective june  will increase the taxefficiency design of the models via allocations of between  and  to taxaware funds depending on the model strategy in part this will be accomplished via the addition of the two new funds the russell taxmanaged international equity fund and russell tax exempt high yield bond fund the russell taxmanaged international equity fund will replace the russell international developed markets fund and the russell emerging markets fund the russell tax exempt high yield bond fund will replace the russell global opportunistic credit fund the russell global infrastructure fund is also being added to the russell taxmanaged model strategies to potentially enhance return and contribute to portfolio diversification “the reallocated russell taxmanaged model strategies represent our best thinking on taxaware total portfolio solutions and are rooted in russell investments’ globally diversified multiasset investment approach” explained rogerson “this asset allocation is optimized with our enhanced portfolio implementation strategy in the taxmanaged equity funds allowing for trading efficiencies as well as enhanced taxmanagement capabilities across the portfolio including addressing the concerns of capital gains associated with trading single manager funds ultimately we aim to deliver the end investor with a disciplined approach to managing taxes that can help them achieve their investment outcomes” more insights on taxmanaged investing
