boards qa what excites you about coming to work each day first and foremost it’s the people who work here — their commitment to our brands is palpable and energizing it’s the intellectual challenge it’s the competition it’s the excitement of doing great for our consumers — helping people feel better about themselves helping them unlock their own beauty why is continuous learning important at the estée lauder companies learning is an integral part of our culture we continuously ask ourselves is what we’re doing today going to be relevant to the consumer in the future we insist that our leaders never stop exploring new ideas and we expect that mindset to trickle down throughout the company we want employees to feel like they have permission to push the envelope and think differently because we have to constantly reinvent ourselves ultimately no one individual has a monopoly on insight and brilliance innovation comes from every chair you’ve been championing the company’s onlinedigital efforts from their inception what were some of the smartest decisions the company made in this arena when we turned on our first ecommerce site in 6 it was controversial because our retail partners perceived it as a threat to their business we understand now that our online presence enhances our overall business the multichannel consumer is a far more valuable customer who spends more on our brands than the consumer who shops exclusively online or in store the highest click rates on our websites are for the store locators many consumers still want to know where they can see touch feel and smell the product before they buy it what core capabilities will future leaders need to take the business to the next level of growth the technical skills companies need will almost certainly change but the core capabilities needed for effective leadership — curiosity adaptability communication imagination — will be the same leaders have to be bold and have the courage to try something new this applies to their careers and to the business itself i encourage young leaders to live in another country or region to experience another culture — which pushes you to explore and learn what’s different about leading a family company versus a nonfamily company leading a family company and being a member of that family is both a pressure and a privilege in many ways the stakes are higher in a family company because your name is on the door and you can’t just walk away if things go south you are the keeper of the culture — it’s your responsibility to honor and respect the past without letting it hold the company back from its future potential at the same time there is a real advantage to leading a company that is focused on longevity and on generating longterm value we practice what i call “patient capitalism” — we have a higher tolerance for longterm investments that yield greater returns    years into the future what’s different about leading a family company versus a nonfamily company leading a family company and being a member of that family is both a pressure and a privilege in many ways the stakes are higher in a family company because your name is on the door

potential at the same time there is a real advantage to leading a company that is focused on longevity and on generating longterm value we practice what i call “patient capitalism” — we have a higher tolerance for longterm investments that yield greater returns    years into the future how do you maintain a family culture in such a large spread out company our definition of family goes beyond the family name — it is broader and more inclusive it involves a sense of belonging it’s about those human touches we put into our company that maintain an ethos that makes people feel they are welcome — because they are we try to maintain a warmth and friendliness that is hopefully part of what most families are like which makes everybody feel they’re a part of the family in one way shape or form it’s becoming a lost definition of family but it still works for us what do you hope to accomplish by the end of your career what do you want your leadership legacy to be the most important thing i want to do is to help set our company on a course for sustainable excellence and leadership in our sector that will last for many generations beyond the influence i might have as an individual i hope that through the executives whose careers we’ve nurtured our company will continue to adapt and thrive while maintaining the value systems that have allowed us to get to where we are today — and those values endure for many generations to come what is your definition of beauty my definition of beauty is the tremendous diversity we have inside of our company diversity of our people diversity of our

and innovation and new ideas and frankly because of the intellectual challenge — it’s fantastic there’s an amazing mix of historic strengths and future potential that fuels our efforts can you explain the concept of “leadership from every chair” “leadership from every chair” means leadership from each person in the company even if they started yesterday it is leadership that comes from engagement and participation not from authority it stems from our deeprooted commitment to employee education and to developing future leaders providing employees the opportunity to continuously learn is

lawyers life qa what drew you to work for the estée lauder companies i was drawn to the company by its reputation and integrity the quality of our people and products and the challenges and opportunities of a global public company also the breast cancer awareness campaign resonated deeply with me evelyn lauder’s commitment was in many ways the icing on the cake how would you describe the company’s culture i think we have a unique and very special blend of family values and public company values the culture here is very strong with regard to quality high performance collaboration and caring about each other worklife balance is an evergreen topic when it comes to women in the workplace what is your philosophy on worklife balance and what is your best advice for women in the workplace today my best advice is to figure out what is important to you and align your work and life to make that happen structure your life to include work and personal time in a balance that is right for you every person is responsible for his or her own happiness and success what do you love most about your role at the company i love when i work with a team to solve difficult problems an enormous value that lawyers bring is to “connect the dots” being involved in so many aspects of the business enables me to see many of the dots and to connect them in a way that can contribute to our success — that is fun for me reflecting on your career what are the most important lessons you have learned the most important lesson is to take risks there were key moments in my career where i took risks and those have led to the greatest jobs of my career take risks and go for it the other important lesson — which is what i tell my children — is “what goes around comes around” you earn a

philosophy is centered on themes of transparency and fluidity as we recruit talent it’s critical to make it clear what the work is and what our culture is all about once in the job employees need to understand what is expected from them in their role and which competency skills they need to develop to get to the next level — both from a technical and a leadership perspective finally it is paramount to have a mechanism for movement of talent across brands and geographies to facilitate the building of experiences at the estée lauder companies we are creating talent road maps that are not your traditional pyramids there are many side roads vs straight roads — which is more like tech or startup companies what are the unexpected benefits of working here this company is very collaborative and inclusive with a high level of inhouse creativity we have the left brain and the right brain the linear and the nonlinear we’re a collection of people with different backgrounds and different experiences and as some brands are growing by  percent to  percent a year we are not in a steady state like you’ll find with traditional consumer brands another unexpected benefit is the high level of focus on ongoing learning and education at the company which stems from timehonored commitments from leonard a lauder and william p lauder the lauder family values permeate the organization and as a result there is a huge amount of heart within the company this is evident in our philanthropic efforts and beyond people care about each other why is the company a good training ground for tomorrow’s business leaders anyone coming into this organization will be exposed to a multitude of global issues from geographic expansion to channel differentiation from new acquisition of brands to exponential growth of current brands based on the way the organization is growing and developing business leaders are going to find themselves in situations they’ve never been in before even very seasoned leaders will see things in ways they haven’t seen before fundamental changes in our business are demanding that our people relearn and develop new competencies in areas like digital marketing and online sales and in the operation of freestanding retail stores the onthejob training component for us is huge what is the most meaningful or inspiring aspect of your role by virtue of leading people and through the creation of certain policies and processes i can make the work around here a little better more interesting more meaningful it’s not just about getting people paid or providing health benefits in my role you have the ability to help people find purpose in their work it’s exciting to implement impactful training programs that help develop great leaders to create incentive plans that recognize and reward great performance in many ways i control quite a few of these levers what is your definition of beauty it’s not about the aesthetic it’s about how it makes you feel through our products we

why is continuous learning important at the estée lauder companies learning is an integral part of our culture we continuously ask ourselves is what we’re doing today going to be relevant to the consumer in the future we insist that our leaders never stop exploring new ideas and we expect that mindset to trickle down throughout the company we want employees to feel like they have permission to push the envelope and think differently because we have to constantly reinvent ourselves ultimately no one individual has a monopoly on insight and brilliance innovation comes from every chair you’ve been championing the company’s onlinedigital efforts from their inception what were some of the smartest decisions the company made in this arena when we turned on our first ecommerce site in 6 it was controversial because our retail partners perceived it as a threat to their business we understand now that our online presence enhances our overall business the multichannel consumer is a far more valuable customer who spends more on our brands than the consumer who shops exclusively online or in store the highest click rates on our websites are for the store locators many consumers still want to know where they can see touch feel and smell the product before they buy it what core capabilities will future leaders need to take the business to the next level of growth the technical skills companies need will almost certainly change but the core capabilities needed for effective leadership — curiosity adaptability communication imagination — will be the same leaders have to be

privilege in many ways the stakes are higher in a family company because your name is on the door and you can’t just walk away if things go south you are the keeper of the culture — it’s your responsibility to honor and respect the past without letting it hold the company back from its future potential at the same time there is a real advantage to leading a company that is focused on longevity and on generating longterm value we practice what i call “patient capitalism” — we have a higher tolerance for longterm investments that yield greater returns    years into the future what’s

out company our definition of family goes beyond the family name — it is broader and more inclusive it involves a sense of belonging it’s about those human touches we put into our company that maintain an ethos that makes people feel they are welcome — because they are we try to maintain a warmth and friendliness that is hopefully part of what most families are like which makes everybody feel they’re a part of the family in one way shape or form it’s becoming a lost definition of family but it still works for us what do you hope to accomplish by the end of your career what do you want
