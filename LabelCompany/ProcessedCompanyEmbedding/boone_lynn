bradstreet inc  all rights reserved bookkeeper® for spray use in single item treatments the american institute for conservation bookkeeper� for spray use in single item treatments terry boone lynn kidder and susan russick introduction the investigation into a new nonaqueous deacidification system for use in single item treatments was based on the premise that deacidification benefits paper based materials and that a conservators acceptance of these benefits can be compromised by dissatisfaction with currently available nonaqueous methods the decision to explore the efficacy of the bookkeeper spray system was supported by encouraging results in the bookkeeper mass deacidification system research the goals were to clarify the extent of benefits and risks associated with bookkeeper and to develop a protocol for selection testing and treatment of rare and special collection materials several tests were developed while working closely with dr chandru shahani chief preservation research and testing division ken harris preservation projects director and the librarys preservation research and testing laboratory staff these tests were designed to determine the efficacy of the product when applied by spray to single items through measurement of the quantity of alkaline reserve deposited by the spray the uniformity of the spray application the speed and extent of the reaction the amount of penetration or migration possible and any effect on media the decision to deacidify although much information and knowledge exists regarding the benefits and risks of deacidification many conservators have not found it easy to interpret and use that information in a consistent manner conservators are responsible for the immediate and long term consequences of deacidification treatments and naturally have reservations about performing treatments which cause unacceptable alterations in the object even though treatment may prolong the life of the object physical and chemical alterations are direct consequences of treatment therefore the intention is to use methods which provide the highest level of benefit while posing the least amount of risk to the object in the past potential negative effects of deacidification have manifested themselves as yellowing textural change or color shift understandably reluctance to deacidify leads some conservators to rely on good housing and storage in lieu of deacidification these remedies may be appropriate for specific situations however they are only partial solutions and do not provide maximum benefit for many objects treatment decisions require accountability and need to thoroughly address the real consequences including the long term costs of partial or suboptimal treatment solutions the bookkeeper spray product is a viable option because testing shows that the chemistry appears to work as theorized with few unwanted side effects the treatment referred to as deacidification actually describes two different situations one the removal of acids byproducts and neutralization of remaining acids and two the deposit of an alkaline material which neutralizes the acids and leaves an alkaline reserve when the need for deacidification is indicated as part of a treatment strategy the conservator must choose between aqueous and nonaqueous methods in either system water is necessary for deacidification to occur the most benefit to the cellulose chain can be gained from aqueous processes because through immersion water soluble acids and their byproducts are actually washed from the paper at the same time that neutralization and deposit of an alkaline reserve occurs where aqueous treatment is not possible neutralization and deposit of an alkaline reserve can still be achieved using a nonaqueous process nonaqueous systems all rely on the natural moisture content of the paper and ambient humidity to allow the neutralization reaction to proceed there are several nonaqueous deacidification systems available all of these pose concerns for the object the conservator and the environment additionally some of the chemicals are costly and face government restrictions on usage and disposal various formulations have been known to leave an odor or visible surface deposit cause changes in media solubility or color cause discoloration of paper or alter the feel and drape of a sheet bookkeeper does not leave an odor on treated objects but in some cases a velvety feel is evident when handling treated paper furthermore the unpredictable effects of application method and equipment also influence the conservators willingness to deacidify a particular concern has been the question of preferential aging or spots and streaks caused by uneven deposits which age at different rates and are thought to create areas of varying strength and weakness aging tests looking for evidence of application methods on preferential effects have not been completed as of this publication in  and  the library contracted with a team of technical experts to evaluate the effects of deacidification with the bookkeeper mass system standard library of congress blue test books and a wide variety of bound volumes representing typical library collection materials were treated by immersion in bookkeeper the blue books were then examined aged and tested for physical endurance the testing showed that bookkeeper deposited an adequate alkaline reserve and the treated samples sustained greater fold endurance and tear strength compared to untreated samples evaluation of the book components of every test volume cover materials titling binding paper media etc revealed a uniform deposit and no unacceptable evidence of treatment since  about  books at the library of congress have been treated with the mass process the bookkeeper spray system has been in use for the last few years on a wide range of collection materials at a growing number of institutions worldwide the bookkeeper nonaqueous deacidification method uses a nontoxic inert liquid perfluoroalkane containing submicron sized particles of magnesium oxide with the addition of a surfactant  a perfluoropolyether derivative to aid in the dispersion of the particles when the product is sprayed onto the object the carrier and surfactant rapidly evaporate and magnesium oxide particles remain lodged in the paper fibers the acid neutralization process begins in theory when ambient moisture or water inherent in the paper reacts with the magnesium oxide to form magnesium hydroxide methodology fig  bookkeeper spray system the bookkeeper spray system consists of an air compressor and a two gallon metal container connected to a six foot hose attached to a metal spray gun that produces a flat  ¡ fan of spray fig  the primary area of spray deposit is about six inches wide bordered by approximately two inches of lighter pattern on either side the medium spraying technique used in all the tests was designed to replicate a conservators standard treatment approach working in the fume hood the spraying parameters were defined as follows all spraying traveled across the paper in a horizontal pattern at a rate of approximately  inches per second at a distance of  inches from the object the technique is to overlap at the edges of the arc in order to create an overall even application the spraying began and ended off the object the light spray was defined as spraying half the amount of time of the medium application and the heavy spray was two applications of the medium

fig b alkaline reserve of sprayed samples of blue book papers vs samples immersed in mass system a test was designed to quantify how much magnesium was deposited with spray applications a comparison with the results from the mass immersion system would allow one to extrapolate longevity expectations for treated objects test procedure was to select four papers from the standard blue test books that the library of congress had prepared for testing mass deacidification the papers whatman chromatography clearspring offset alum rosin sized and newsprint all had a pretreatment ph below  fiber content respectively included cotton softwood kraft and chemical and mechanical wood pulp the samples were sprayed on both sides with light medium and heavy applications ph was measured and alkaline reserve titrated using tappi standard procedure t pm fig a figure b shows that the sprayed alkaline reserve deposit was comparable to the mass immersion samples the vertical axis represents increased percentage of alkaline reserve expressed in terms of caco and each set of columns represents one of the four papers a medium spray deposited close to  alkaline reserve on the four sample papers uniformity of deposit test two tests were designed to visually evaluate the degree of uniformity of the spray deposit test a was simply to spray samples of black paper with light and heavy applications and compare them with a sample which was individually immersed the lightly sprayed sample showed no visual evidence of treatment the sample which was heavily sprayed remained uniform overall but no longer appeared as densely black as the unsprayed sample particles were not distinctly visible on the sprayed samples because when properly dispersed they are too small to be seen under low magnification test b was designed to reveal the pattern of magnesium deposit created by the spray nozzle it was assumed that paper impregnated with a ph indicator solution would instantly record the spray pattern during application  indicator papers were created by immersing standard whatman chromatography paper in brilliant yellow indicator solution in the acidic phase below  this indicator is bright yellow and appears redorange when alkaline above ph  the indicator paper samples were sprayed with bookkeeper solution on both sides with a medium application fig  color change in treated and humidified indicator paper after spraying the treated indicator samples remained yellow and did not undergo the anticipated color shift indicating alkalinity the samples were then placed between blotters and stored at room temperature for a few days to allow inherent moisture in the paper and ambient humidity to cause the change but still no change was observed the decision was made to accelerate the process by humidifying the samples to reveal the spray pattern within  minutes in a warm water passive humidity chamber the color changed gradually ultimately reaching the redorange color in about an hour fig  a relatively even spray pattern was evident during the early stages of humidification however as humidification progressed the pattern disappeared and the sheet became a solid color occasional areas of variable quantities of deposit such as those caused by drips and sputters were not visible on the fully humidified samples speed and extent of neutralization reaction test fig  comparison of colorimeter readings of humidified and unhumidified treated samples the  report states that the chemistries leading to acid neutralization are poorly understood and occur over some indefinite time period following the treatment the color change in the brilliant yellow indicator paper to orange is a ph sensitivity reaction the lack of a change suggests that if neutralization occurs the ph of the paper is less than or equal to  significant moisture passive humidification in this instance had to be introduced in order to cause the ph change in these alkaline sensitive test materials a test was designed to measure the speed and extent of the neutralizing action because the expected color change did not appear to be occurring in the indicator papers without exposure to additional moisture the minolta chroma meter cr was used to record color change over time because changes in the unhumidified samples were so subtle six groups of indicator papers were tested some sprayed with the product on one side and some on both sides half of the samples were humidified and half were not dramatic color change occurred in treated samples which had been humidified while there was no visual evidence of change in those that had not been humidified figure  compares results of two different samples one humidified and the other not where the colorimeter readings were taken before treatment and over a five week period after humidification the measured color change over time was insignificant in the unhumidified samples humidification definitely accelerated the rate and the extent of the color change in the samples there was a sharp initial increase in redness at the time of humidification which then leveled off and remained fairly constant fig  comparison of front and back of humidified single sample treated on front only figure  compares the colorimeter readings from the front and back of a single sheet which was treated only on the front and then humidified while a dramatic increase in redness occurred on the treated side there was also a significant increase in redness on the untreated side penetration from the treated side of the sample through to the untreated side was unexpected since the magnesium is felt to be too large to move into the paper itself observation of what might indicate penetration led to the development of the next

paper block samples the fourth test was designed to determine the degree of penetration of bookkeeper into the paper two sets of sample blocks were made one of acidic newsprint ca s and one of acidified japanese paper ca s the newsprint blocks were made by layering six sheets wet out with water then pressed together the japanese blocks were made up of nine sheets also wet out and pressed together when dried the blocks were sprayed with the bookkeeper product on one side the blocks were then edge trimmed and cut into twelve sample blocks the samples were humidified for one hour or  hour periods or not at all after humidification the sample blocks were dried under pressure in order to keep the layers in contact with each other then they were disassembled and each layer was titrated separately for alkaline reserve and ph fig  a and fig  a both sample groups showed significant alkaline reserve in the top layer some alkaline reserve in the second layer and a corresponding rise in the respective ph initial test results of the japanese paper blocks show a significant alkaline reserve on the second layer as well as measurable amounts on layers three and four due to time constraints the number of our samples was limited and therefore additional data needs to be collected before further conclusions are drawn regarding japanese papers the newsprint samples showed significant alkaline reserve in the top layer two of the samples showed a measurable alkaline reserve in the second layer and all samples had an elevated ph in the top and second layers these numbers indicate penetration of the alkaline material through the first layer of newsprint there was no significant difference between the alkaline reserves and ph values between the one hour humidified and unhumidified samples which indicates penetration occurred at the time of application however the  hour humidification did cause change resulting in lower alkaline reserves and ph values the lower alkaline reserve results are significant because they indicate that the alkaline reserve has been partially used yet a measurable amount remains in the sample the ph level in the top layer has correspondingly been slightly reduced but remains comparable to that of the samples which were not humidified and those which received an hour of humidification test for effect on media figure  media

in the mass project fig  although the bookkeeper product has not been found to cause bleeding or sinking of any media ph related color shifts are of course possible the one example of a ph color shift that was observed was in the mass immersion process where a blue highlighter marker turned green without humidification as a result of treatment with bookkeeper in these final tests media was selected which was specific to rare materials including some known to be alkaline sensitive fig  all were commercially produced watercolor or gouache except for the gamboge and copper acetateverdigris which were made following historic recipes bookkeeper was applied to samples as follows no application light on one side light on both sides heavy on one side heavy on both sides or immersed when treated on only one side the bookkeeper was sprayed directly onto the media side of the sample again sample groups were humidified either for one hour or  hours or not at all figure  media tested with bookkeeper spray alizarin crimson alizarin rose madder cadmium yellow medium chrome yellow gold metallic drawing ink with gum arabic hooker s green deep indian yellow orange lake deep prussian blue raw sienna ultramarine deep van dyke brown verdigris vermilion results showed that some of the darker colors which had received a heavier application appeared to be very slightly grayer or hazier than the same colors which got light and medium applications this effect is not specifically a change in the media but the result of white deposit on a dark or solid colored field most of the samples did not undergo a noticeable change with the exception of gamboge samples of gamboge which were treated but not humidified remained yellow after humidification gamboge displayed a textbook example of a ph color shift it was interesting to note that the color shift to orange was complete on the sample which had bookkeeper lightly applied on both sides and on those with the heavier applications yet the samples which were lightly treated on one side and humidified were still very true to the original yellow color additional media and papers which have been treated are listed in appendix  conclusions and recommendations for use to summarize the intention was to determine the efficacy of the product when applied by spray to single items to measure the quantity of alkaline reserve deposited by the spray the uniformity of the spray application the speed and extent of the reaction the amount of penetration or migration possible and any effect on media in general it appeared that the equipment applied the product effectively uniformly and deposited an adequate alkaline reserve and produced minimal effect on a wide range of media it also appeared from this work that the product penetrated into the test papers and that humidity played a role in the process of using the alkaline reserve fig  selection for treatment with bookkeeper a conservator would consider the needs of the object when interpreting any test results and incorporating the information into actual treatment fig  tests showed that the system will deposit an adequate alkaline reserve when applied to most papers using a medium spray but of course the spraying technique should be customized to the paper and media for example a more open paper like japanese whether by fiber formation or breakdown of size or age will be penetrated more easily than a paper of greater weight harder surface or fresher size in order to obtain the most significant alkaline reserve and penetration it is recommended that most papers be sprayed on both sides penetration occurs as a result of wetness at the time of spraying and the spray should be applied with this in mind posttreatment humidification is a step to consider because it accelerates the acid neutralization process but tests showed that measurable deacidification will occur to some extent even without humidification the behavioral evidence of the chemistry of bookkeeper on ph sensitive media allows the conservator greater latitude in treatment decisions bookkeeper poses minimal risk to most of the media that was tested however it is clear that in order to witness potential ph color shifts both bookkeeper and moisture must be applied the risk of color shift is greatly reduced if less of the product is used or if it is applied to the verso bookkeeper has been applied successfully to most papers however the product is somewhat evident on dark colors and highly calendered papers layering on lightly would be an option when the color or surface quality of the paper or media will cause a deposit to be more visible documentation of objects treated with bookkeeper is important since future treatment or water emergencies may result in color shift although bookkeeper is nontoxic fine particulates are involved which may result in lung or eye irritations and the use of gloves and the fume hood are recommended for this reason because of the rapid drying time low reactivity and nontoxic nature of the carrier items may be removed from the fume hood immediately after spraying batched treatments or bound materials may be stacked or closed without fear of distortion or offsetting more extensive testing of media treated with bookkeeper will allow expanded protocol for selection research needs to be undertaken on potential reactions with graphite metallic printing inks and other media conservators encounter in their work while bookkeeper will not solve all nonaqueous deacidification problems the bookkeeper spray system provides a safe effective and easily used method which causes virtually no evident harm to the environment the user and the object acknowledgment special thanks to our colleagues at the library of congress especially
