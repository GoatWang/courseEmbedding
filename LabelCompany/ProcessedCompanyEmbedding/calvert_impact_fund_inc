otherwise noted smallcap issuers applies to small cap value and mid cap value the securities of smallcap issuers may be less actively traded than the securities of largercap issuers may trade in a more limited volume and may change in value more abruptly than securities of larger companies information concerning these securities may not be readily available so that the companies may be less actively followed by stock analysts smallcap issuers do not usually participate in market rallies to the same extent as more widely known securities and they tend to have a relatively higher percentage of insider ownership investing in smaller new issuers generally involves greater risk than investing in larger established issuers smallcap issuers may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may lack management depth the securities in such companies may also have limited marketability and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than securities of larger more established companies or the market averages in general midcap issuers applies to mid cap value the securities of midcap issuers often have greater price volatility lower trading volume and less liquidity than larger more established companies investing in midcap issuers generally involves greater risk than investing in larger established issuers these companies tend to have smaller revenues narrower product lines less management depth and experience smaller shares of their product or service markets fewer financial resources and less competitive strength than larger companies derivatives applies to large cap growth this fund may use various techniques to increase or decrease its exposure to changing security prices interest rates or other factors that affect security values these techniques may involve derivative transactions specifically buying and selling stock index options and futures through these investments the advisor and  or subadvisor seeks to keep the longterm average market risk of the fund roughly equal to the market itself using hedging strategies the funds exposure to market risk may be negatively correlated to the market or may be as high as  at any one point in time as measured by the funds estimated beta beta is a measure of market risk contained within the body of financial research called modern portfolio theory a portfolio beta of  means that a  increase decrease in the stock market should result in a  increase decrease in the fund negative correlation to the market means that if the market goes up the value of the fund goes down these strategies are intended to maintain a more constant level of total risk for example if the advisor and  or subadvisor feels the fund is exposed to an unusually high probability of general stock market decline it might sell stock index futures to offset this risk the fund can use these practices either as substitution or as protection against an adverse move in the fund to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the fund if the advisor and  or subadvisor judges market conditions incorrectly or employs a strategy that does not correlate well with the funds investments or if the counterparty to the transaction does not perform as promised these techniques could result in a loss these techniques may increase the volatility of the fund and may involve a small investment of cash relative to the magnitude of the risk assumed derivatives are often illiquid although the advisor and  or subadvisor believes that the investment techniques it employs to manage risk in the fund will further the funds investment objectives and reduce losses that might otherwise occur during a time of general decline in stock prices no assurance can be given that these investment techniques will achieve this result the techniques used here would reduce losses during a time of general stock market decline if the fund had previously sold futures or bought puts on stock indexes offsetting some portion of the market risk the advisor and or subadvisor intends to buy and sell stock index futures calls andor puts in the fund to increase or decrease the funds exposure to stock market risk as indicated by statistical models the advisor and  or subadvisor will use these instruments to attempt to maintain a more constant level of risk as measured by certain statistical indicators options and futures contracts applies to large cap growth this fund may engage in the purchase and sale of stock index futures contracts and options on such futures to reduce market risk of the fund as described more fully below futures transactions the fund may purchase and sell stock index futures the fund can use financial futures to increase or decrease its exposure to changing security prices the fund may use futures and options contracts for the purpose of seeking to reduce the overall investment risk that would otherwise be associated with the securities in which it invests for example the fund may sell a stock index futures contract in anticipation of a general market or market sector decline that might adversely affect prices of the funds portfolio securities alternatively the fund might purchase a stock index futures contract in anticipation of a general market or market sector advance a stock index future is a contract to buy or sell the cash value of a specific stock index at a specific price by a specified date upon buying or selling a futures contract the fund deposits initial margin with its custodian and thereafter daily payments of maintenance margin are made to and from the executing broker payments of maintenance margin reflect changes in the value of the futures contract with the fund being obligated to make such payments if its futures position becomes less valuable and entitled to receive such payments if its positions become more valuable if the advisor and  or subadvisor judges market conditions incorrectly or employs a strategy that does not correlate well with the funds investments or if the counterparty to the transaction does not perform as promised these techniques could result in a loss these techniques may increase the volatility of the fund and may involve a small investment of cash relative to the magnitude of the risk assumed although some of the securities in the stock index underlying a futures contract may not necessarily meet the funds social criteria any such position taken by the fund will not constitute a direct ownership interest in the securities of the underlying stock index futures contracts are designed by boards of trade which are designated contracts markets by the commodity futures trading commission cftc as a series of a registered investment company the fund is eligible for exclusion from the cftcs definition of commodity pool operator meaning that the fund may invest in futures contracts under specified conditions without registering with the cftc futures contracts trade on contracts markets in a manner that is similar to the way a stock trades on a stock exchange and the boards of trade through their clearing corporations guarantee performance of the contracts options on stock index futures the fund may purchase put or call options that are traded on a us exchange or board of trade although some of the securities in the stock index underlying a stock index futures contract may not necessarily meet the funds social criteria any such position taken by the fund will not constitute a direct ownership interest in the securities of the underlying stock index an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract  a long position if the option is a call and a short position if the option is a put  at a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the option the fund will pay a premium for such options purchased or sold in connection with such options bought or sold the fund will make initial margin deposits and make or receive maintenance margin payments that reflect changes in the market value of such options this arrangement is similar to the margin arrangements applicable to futures contracts described above put options on stock index futures the purchase of put options on futures contracts is analogous to the sale of futures contracts and is used to protect the funds portfolio of securities against the risk of declining prices the fund may purchase put options on futures contracts that are already owned by the fund call options on stock index futures the purchase of call options on futures contracts is analogous to the purchase of a futures contract and is used to participate in potential price increases of the underlying index risks of options and futures contracts where the fund has sold futures or taken options positions to hedge against decline in the market the market may advance and the value of the securities held in the fund may decline if this were to occur the fund might lose money on the futures contracts or options and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities it is possible that there will be imperfect correlation or even no correlation between price movements of the investments being hedged and the options or futures used in addition the fund will pay commissions and other costs in connection with such investments which may increase the funds expenses and reduce its yield index prices may be distorted if trading of certain stocks included in the index is interrupted trading in index options also may be interrupted in certain circumstances such as if trading were halted in a substantial number of stocks included in the index or if dissemination of the current level of an underlying index is interrupted if this occurs the fund would not be able to close out options that it had purchased and if restrictions on exercise were imposed may be unable to exercise an option it holds which could result in losses if the underlying index moves adversely before trading resumes the purchaser of an index option may also be subject to a timing risk if an option is exercised by the fund before final determination of the closing index value for that day the risk exists that the level of the underlying index may subsequently change if such a change caused the exercised option to fall outof themoney that is the exercising of the option would result in a loss not a gain the fund will be required to pay the difference between the closing index value and the exercise price of the option times the applicable multiplier to the assigned writer although the fund may be able to minimize this risk by withholding exercise instructions until just before the daily cutoff time it may not be possible to eliminate this risk entirely because the exercise cutoff times for index options may be earlier than those fixed for other types of options and may occur before definitive closing index values are announced alternatively when the index level is close to the exercise price the fund may sell rather than exercise the option although the markets for certain index option contracts have developed rapidly the markets for other index options are not as liquid the ability to establish and close out positions on such options will be subject to the development and maintenance of a liquid secondary market it is not certain that this market will develop in all index option contracts the fund will not purchase or sell any index option contract unless and until in the opinion of the investment manager the market for such options has developed sufficiently that the risk in connection with such transactions is no greater than the risk in connection with options on stocks where futures are purchased to hedge against a possible increase in the price of a security before the fund is able to fashion its program to invest in the security or in options on the security it is possible that the market may decline if the fund as a result decided not to make the planned investment at that time either because of concern as to the possible further market decline or for other reasons the fund could realize a loss on the futures contract that is not offset by a reduction in the price of securities purchased in addition to the possibility that there may be an imperfect correlation or no correlation at all between movements in the stock index future and the portion of the portfolio being hedged the price of stock index futures may not correlate perfectly with movements in the stock index due to certain market distortions all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions that could distort the normal relationship between the index itself and the value of a future moreover the deposit requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities market and may therefore cause increased participation by speculators in the futures market such increased participation may also cause temporary price distortions due to the possibility of price distortion in the futures market and because of the imperfect correlation between movements in stock indices and movements in the prices of stock index futures the value of stock index futures contracts as a hedging device may be reduced in addition if the fund has insufficient available cash it may at times have to sell securities to meet variation margin requirements such sales may have to be effected at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so nonprincipal investment policies and risks the following discussion of nonprincipal investment policies and risks applies to each of the funds unless otherwise noted foreign securities investments in foreign securities may present risks not typically involved in domestic investments the funds may purchase foreign securities directly on foreign markets or those represented by american depositary receipts adrs or other receipts evidencing ownership of foreign securities such as international depositary receipts and global depositary receipts adrs are united states us dollardenominated and traded in the united states on exchanges or over the counter and can be either sponsored or unsponsored the company sponsoring adr is subject to us reporting requirements and will pay the costs of distributing dividends and materials with an unsponsored adr the us bank will recover costs from the movement of shares and dividends less information is normally available on unsponsored adrs by investing in adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock the funds may possibly avoid some currency and some liquidity risks however the value of the foreign securities underlying the adr may still be impacted by currency fluctuations the information available for adrs is subject to the more uniform and more exacting accounting auditing and financial reporting standards of the domestic market or exchange on which they are traded additional costs may be incurred in connection with international investment since foreign brokerage commissions and the custodial costs associated with maintaining foreign portfolio securities are generally higher than in the united states fee expense may also be incurred on currency exchanges when the funds change investments from one country to another or convert foreign securities holdings into us dollars u s government policies have at times in the past through imposition of interest equalization taxes and other restrictions discouraged certain investments abroad by u s investors in addition foreign countries may impose withholding and taxes on dividends and interest since investments in securities of issuers domiciled in foreign countries usually involve currencies of the foreign countries and since the funds may temporarily hold funds in foreign currencies during the completion of investment programs the value of the assets of the funds as measured in u s dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations for example if the value of the foreign currency in which a security is denominated increases or declines in relation to the value of the us dollar the value of the security in us dollars will increase or decline correspondingly the funds will conduct their foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign exchange market or through entering into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies a forward foreign currency contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract these contracts are traded in the interbank market conducted directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers a forward foreign currency contract generally has no deposit requirement and no commissions are charged at any stage for trades the funds may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for two reasons first a fund may desire to preserve the u s dollar price of a security when it enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency the fund may be able to protect itself against possible losses resulting from changes in the relationship between the u s dollar and foreign currencies during the period between the date the security is purchased or sold and the date on which payment is made or received by entering into a forward contract for the purchase or sale for a fixed amount of dollars of the amount of the foreign currency involved in the underlying security transactions second when the advisor or subadvisor believes that the currency of a particular foreign country may suffer a substantial decline against the u s dollar a fund enters into a forward foreign currency contract to sell for a fixed amount of dollars the amount of foreign currency approximating the value of some or all of the funds securities denominated in such foreign currency the precise matching of the forward foreign currency contract amounts and the value of the funds securities involved will not generally be possible since the future value of the securities will change as a consequence of market movements between the date the forward contract is entered into and the date it matures the projection of shortterm currency market movement is difficult and the successful execution of this shortterm hedging strategy is uncertain although forward foreign currency contracts tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged currency at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result should the value of such currency increase the funds do not intend to enter into such forward contracts under this circumstance on a regular or continuous basis smallcap issuers applies to large cap growth see description of smallcap issuers in supplemental information on principal investment policies and risks above temporary defensive positions for temporary defensive purposes  which may include a lack of adequate purchase candidates or an unfavorable market environment  the funds may invest in cash or cash equivalents cash equivalents include instruments such as but not limited to us government and agency obligations certificates of deposit bankers acceptances time deposits commercial paper shortterm corporate debt securities and repurchase agreements the funds may invest in money market instruments of banks whether foreign or domestic including obligations of us branches of foreign banks yankee instruments and obligations of foreign branches of us banks eurodollar instruments all such instruments must be highquality us dollardenominated obligations although not subject to foreign currency risk since they are us dollardenominated investments in foreign money market instruments may involve risks that are different than investments in securities of us issuers see foreign securities above the funds investments in temporary defensive positions are generally not fdic insured even though a bank may be the issuer repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements each of the funds may invest less than  of its net assets in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements combined but typically will invest  or less of its net assets in these instruments repurchase agreements are arrangements under which the fund buys a security and the seller simultaneously agrees to repurchase the security at a mutually agreedupon time and price reflecting a market rate of interest repurchase agreements are shortterm money market investments designed to generate current income a fund engages in repurchase agreements in order to earn a higher rate of return than it could earn simply by investing in the obligation which is the subject of the repurchase agreement repurchase agreements are not however without risk in the event of the bankruptcy of a seller during the term of a repurchase agreement a legal question exists as to whether the fund would be deemed the owner of the underlying security or would be deemed only to have a security interest in and lien upon such security the funds will only engage in repurchase agreements with recognized securities dealers and banks determined to present minimal credit risk by the advisor under the direction and supervision of the funds board of directors in addition the funds will only engage in repurchase agreements reasonably designed to secure fully during the term of the agreement the sellers obligation to repurchase the underlying security and will monitor the market value of the underlying security during the term of the agreement if the value of the underlying security declines and is not at least equal to the repurchase price due the fund pursuant to the agreement the fund will require the seller to pledge additional securities or cash to secure the sellers obligations pursuant to the agreement if the seller defaults on its obligation to repurchase and the value of the underlying security declines the fund may incur a loss and may incur expenses in selling the underlying security while an underlying security may bear a maturity in excess of one year repurchase agreements are generally for periods of less than one year repurchase agreements not terminable within seven days are considered illiquid under a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells portfolio securities to a bank or securities dealer and agrees to repurchase those securities from such party at an agreed upon date and price reflecting a market rate of interest a fund invests the proceeds from each reverse repurchase agreement in obligations in which it is authorized to invest a fund intends to enter into a reverse repurchase agreement only when the interest income provided for in the obligation in which the fund invests the proceeds is expected to exceed the amount the fund will pay in interest to the other party to the agreement plus all costs associated with the transactions the funds do not intend to borrow for leverage purposes the funds will only be permitted to pledge assets to the extent necessary to secure borrowings and reverse repurchase agreements during the time a reverse repurchase agreement is outstanding the fund will maintain in a segregated custodial account an amount of cash us government securities or other liquid highquality debt securities equal in value to the repurchase price the fund will mark to market the value of assets held in the segregated account and will place additional assets in the account whenever the total value of the account falls below the amount required under applicable regulations a funds use of reverse repurchase agreements involves the risk that the other party to the agreements could become subject to bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings during the period the agreements are outstanding in such event the fund may not be able to repurchase the securities it has sold to that other party under those circumstances if at the expiration of the agreement such securities are of greater value than the proceeds obtained by the fund under the agreement the fund may have been better off had it not entered into the agreement however the funds will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only with banks and dealers which the advisor believes present minimal credit risks under guidelines adopted by each funds board of directors in addition a fund bears the risk that the market value of the securities it sold may decline below the agreedupon repurchase price in which case the dealer may request the fund to post additional collateral high social impact investments the high social impact investments program targets a percentage of a funds assets to directly support the growth of communitybased organizations for the purposes of promoting business creation housing development and economic and social development of urban and rural communities these securities are unrated and are deemed by the advisor to be the equivalent of noninvestment grade debt securities  that is lower quality debt securities generally those rated bb or lower by standard  poors sp or ba or lower by moodys investors service inc moodys these securities are commonly known as junk bonds these securities have moderate to poor protection of principal and interest payments and have speculative characteristics see appendix b for a description of the ratings rather than earning a higher rate as would be expected to compensate for the higher risk ie lower credit quality they earn a rate of return that is lower than the rate currently earned by high quality us treasury securities there is no secondary market for these securities the funds expect to make their high social impact investments primarily through the purchase of notes issued by the calvert social investment foundation a nonprofit organization legally distinct from the funds and calvert group ltd organized as a charitable and educational foundation for the purpose of increasing public awareness and knowledge of the concept of socially responsible investing the foundation prepares its own careful credit analysis to attempt to identify those community development issuers whose financial condition is adequate to meet future obligations or is expected to be adequate in the future through portfolio diversification and credit analysis investment risk can be reduced although there can be no assurance that losses will not occur noninvestment grade debt securities noninvestment grade debt securities are lower quality debt securities generally those rated bb or lower by sp or ba or lower by moodys known as junk bonds these securities have moderate to poor protection of principal and interest payments and have speculative characteristics see appendix b for a description of the ratings a fund considers a security to be investment grade if it has received an investment grade rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or is an unrated security of comparable quality these securities involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuers creditworthiness than investmentgrade debt securities because the market for lowerrated securities may be thinner and less active than for higherrated securities there may be market price volatility for these securities and limited liquidity in the resale market market prices for these securities may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty or rising interest rates unrated debt securities may fall into the lower quality category unrated securities usually are not attractive to as many buyers as rated securities are which may make them less marketable the quality limitation set forth in a funds investment policy is determined immediately after the funds acquisition of a given security accordingly any later change in ratings will not be considered when determining whether an investment complies with the funds investment policy through portfolio diversification and credit analysis investment risk can be reduced although there can be no assurance that losses will not occur warrants the funds may invest in warrants warrants are options to purchase common stock at a specific price usually at a premium above the market value of the optioned common stock at issuance valid for a specific period of time warrants may have a life ranging from less than one year to perpetual however most warrants have expiration dates after which they are worthless in addition a warrant is worthless if the market price of the common stock does not exceed the warrants exercise price during the life of the warrant warrants have no voting rights pay no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation issuing them the percentage increase or decrease in the market price of the warrant may tend to be greater than the percentage increase or decrease in the market price of the optioned common stock derivatives a fund may use various techniques to increase or decrease its exposure to changing security prices interest rates or other factors that affect security values these techniques may involve derivative transactions such as buying and selling options and futures contracts and leveraged notes entering into swap agreements and purchasing indexed securities a fund can use these practices either as substitution or as protection against an adverse move in the fund to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the fund if the advisor andor subadvisor judges market conditions incorrectly or employs a strategy that does not correlate well with a funds investments or if the counterparty to the transaction does not perform as promised these techniques could result in a loss these techniques may increase the volatility of a fund and may involve a small investment of cash relative to the magnitude of the risk assumed derivatives are often illiquid options and futures contracts applies to small cap value and mid cap value the funds may purchase put and call options and engage in the writing of covered call options and secured put options on securities which meet the applicable funds social criteria and employ a variety of other investment techniques specifically the funds may also engage in the purchase and sale of stock index futures contracts foreign currency futures contracts interest rate futures contracts and options on such futures as described more fully below the funds may engage in such transactions only to hedge the existing positions in the respective funds they may not engage in such transactions for the purposes of speculation or leverage such investment policies and techniques may involve a greater degree of risk than those inherent in more conservative investment approaches the funds may write covered options on securities in standard contracts traded on national securities exchanges the funds may write such options in order to receive the premiums from options that expire and to seek net gains from closing purchase transactions with respect to such options put and call options each of the funds may purchase put and call options in standard contracts traded on national securities exchanges on securities of issuers which meet the funds social criteria the funds will purchase such options only to hedge against changes in the value of securities the funds hold and not for the purposes of speculation or leverage by buying a put a fund has the right to sell the security at the exercise price thus limiting its risk of loss through a decline in the market value of the security until the put expires the amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying security will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the put option and any related transaction costs prior to its expiration a put option may be sold in a closing sale transaction and any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the put option plus the related transaction costs each of the funds may purchase call options on securities which it may intend to purchase and which meet the funds social criteria such transactions may be entered into in order to limit the risk of a substantial increase in the market price of the security which a fund intends to purchase prior to its expiration a call option may be sold in a closing sale transaction any profit or loss from such a sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the call option plus the related transaction costs covered options each of the funds may write only covered options on equity and debt securities in standard contracts traded on national securities exchanges this means that in the case of call options so long as a fund is obligated as the writer of a call option the fund will own the underlying security subject to the option and in the case of put options the fund will through its custodian deposit and maintain either cash or securities with a market value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the option when a fund writes a covered call option the fund gives the purchaser the right to purchase the security at the call option price at any time during the life of the option as the writer of the option the fund receives a premium less a commission and in exchange foregoes the opportunity to profit from any increase in the market value of the security exceeding the call option price the premium serves to mitigate the effect of any depreciation in the market value of the security writing covered call options can increase the income of the fund and thus reduce declines in the net asset value per share of the fund if securities covered by such options decline in value exercise of a call option by the purchaser however will cause the fund to forego future appreciation of the securities covered by the option when a fund writes a covered put option it will gain a profit in the amount of the premium less a commission so long as the price of the underlying security remains above the exercise price however the fund remains obligated to purchase the underlying security from the buyer of the put option usually in the event the price of the security falls below the exercise price at any time during the option period if the price of the underlying security falls below the exercise price the fund may realize a loss in the amount of the difference between the exercise price and the sale price of the security less the premium received a fund may purchase securities which may be covered with call options solely on the basis of considerations consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the fund the funds turnover may increase through the exercise of a call option this will generally occur if the market value of a covered security increases and the fund has not entered into a closing purchase transaction risks related to options transactions the funds can close out their respective positions in exchangetraded options only on an exchange which provides a secondary market in such options although the funds intend to acquire and write only such exchangetraded options for which an active secondary market appears to exist there can be no assurance that such a market will exist for any particular option contract at any particular time this might prevent the funds from closing an options position which could impair the funds ability to hedge effectively the inability to close out a call position may have an adverse effect on liquidity because a fund may be required to hold the securities underlying the option until the option expires or is exercised other principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand interest rates the current market price price volatility of the underlying security and the time remaining until the expiration date futures transactions each of the funds may purchase and sell futures contracts but only when in the judgment of the advisor such a position acts as a hedge against market changes which would adversely affect the securities held by the fund these futures contracts may include but are not limited to market index futures contracts and futures contracts based on us government obligations a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a security on a future date which has the effect of establishing the current price for the security although futures contracts by their terms require actual delivery and acceptance of securities in most cases the contracts are closed out before the settlement date without the making or taking of delivery of securities upon buying or selling a futures contract a fund deposits initial margin with its custodian and thereafter daily payments of maintenance margin are made to and from the executing broker payments of maintenance margin reflect changes in the value of the futures contract with the fund being obligated to make such payments if its futures position becomes less valuable and entitled to receive such payments if its positions become more valuable the funds can use these practices only for hedging purposes and not for speculation or leverage if the advisor andor subadvisor judges market conditions incorrectly or employs a strategy that does not correlate well with a funds investments or if the counterparty to the transaction does not perform as promised these techniques could result in a loss these techniques may increase the volatility of a fund and may involve a small investment of cash relative to the magnitude of the risk assumed although some of the securities underlying a futures contract may not necessarily meet the funds social criteria any such hedge position taken by the fund will not constitute a direct ownership interest in the underlying securities futures contracts are designed by boards of trade which are designated contracts markets by the cftc as series of a registered investment company the funds are eligible for exclusion from the cftcs definition of commodity pool operator meaning that the funds may invest in futures contracts under specified conditions without registering with the cftc futures contracts trade on contracts markets in a manner that is similar to the way a stock trades on a stock exchange and the boards of trade through their clearing corporations guarantee performance of the contracts options on futures contracts each of the funds may purchase and write put or call options and sell call options on futures contracts in which the fund could otherwise invest and which are traded on a us exchange or board of trade the funds may also enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate an existing position that is to sell a put option already owned and to buy a call option to close a position where the fund has already sold a corresponding call option the funds may only invest in options on futures contracts to hedge their respective existing investment positions and not for income enhancement speculation or leverage purposes although some of the securities underlying the futures contract underlying the option may not necessarily meet the funds social criteria any such hedge position taken by the funds will not constitute a direct ownership interest in the underlying securities an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contracta long position if the option is a call and a short position if the option is a putat a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the option the funds will pay a premium for such options purchased or sold in connection with such options bought or sold the funds will make initial margin deposits and make or receive maintenance margin payments which reflect changes in the market value of such options this arrangement is similar to the margin arrangements applicable to futures contracts described above put options on futures contracts the purchase of put options on futures contracts is analogous to the sale of futures contracts and is used to protect a funds portfolio of debt securities against the risk of declining prices a fund may purchase put options and sell put options on futures contracts that are already owned by the fund the funds will only engage in the purchase of put options and the sale of covered put options on market index futures for hedging purposes call options on futures contracts the sale of call options on futures contracts is analogous to the sale of futures contracts and is used to protect a fund against the risk of declining prices the purchase of call options on futures contracts is analogous to the purchase of a futures contract a fund may only buy call options to close an existing position where the fund has already sold a corresponding call option or for a cash hedge the funds will only engage in the sale of call options and the purchase of call options to cover for hedging purposes writing call options on futures contracts the writing of call options on futures contracts constitutes a partial hedge against declining prices of the securities deliverable upon exercise of the futures contract if the futures contract price at expiration is below the exercise price a fund will retain the full amount of the option premium which provides a partial hedge against any decline that may have occurred in the funds securities holdings risks of options and futures contracts if a fund has sold futures or takes options positions to hedge against a decline in the market and the market later advances the fund may suffer a loss on the futures contracts or options which it would not have experienced if it had not hedged correlation is also imperfect between movements in the prices of futures contracts and movements in prices of the securities which are the subject of the hedge thus the price of the futures contract or option may move more than or less than the price of the securities being hedged where a fund has sold futures or taken options positions to hedge against decline in the market the market may advance and the value of the securities held in the fund may decline if this were to occur the fund might lose money on the futures contracts or options and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities the funds can close out futures positions only on an exchange or board of trade which provides a secondary market in such futures although the funds intend to purchase or sell only such futures for which an active secondary market appears to exist there can be no assurance that such a market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time this might prevent the funds from closing a futures position which could require a fund to make daily cash payments with respect to its position in the event of adverse price movements options on futures transactions bear several risks apart from those inherent in options transactions generally the funds ability to close out their options positions in futures contracts will depend upon whether an active secondary market for such options develops and is in existence at the time the funds seek to close their positions there can be no assurance that such a market will develop or exist therefore the funds might be required to exercise the options to realize any profit investment restrictions fundamental

figures measure only the income component of a funds investments while total return includes not only the effect of income dividends but also any change in net asset value or principal amount during the stated period total return is computed by taking the total number of shares purchased by a hypothetical  investment after deducting any applicable sales charge adding all additional shares purchased within the period with reinvested dividends and distributions calculating the value of those shares at the end of the period and dividing the result by the initial  investment note total return as quoted in the financial highlights section of the funds prospectus and annual report to shareholders however per sec instructions does not reflect deduction of the sales charge and corresponds to return without maximum load or wo max load or at nav as referred to herein for periods of more than one year the cumulative total return is then adjusted for the number of years taking

deduct a sales charge return without maximum load which will be higher than total return should be considered only by investors such as participants in certain pension plans to whom the sales charge

its base fee reduced by a performance fee adjustment performance fee which shall vary with the funds performance over a performance period as compared to a benchmark index and will range from a

and other accounts the following describes material conflicts of interest as of september   which may potentially arise in connection with the management of a funds investments by a portfolio manager and that individuals simultaneous management of the investments of any other accounts listed in this sai see other accounts managed by portfolio managers of the funds above calvert large cap growth bridgeway john montgomery actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager has daytoday management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund or other account set forth below is a description of material conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with a portfolio manager who manages multiple funds andor other accounts the management of multiple funds andor other accounts may result in a portfolio manager devoting varying periods of time and attention to the management of each fund andor other account as a result the portfolio manager may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment opportunities for each of those accounts as might be the case if he or she were to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single fund the subadvisor believes this problem may be significantly mitigated by its use of quantitative models which drive stock picking decisions of its actively managed funds if a portfolio manager identifies an investment opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account a fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an allocation of filled purchase or sale orders across all eligible funds and other accounts accordingly the subadvisor has developed guidelines to address the priority order in allocating investment opportunities at times a portfolio manager may determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the funds or other accounts for which he exercises investment responsibility or may decide that certain of the funds or other accounts should take differing positions with respect to a particular security in these cases the portfolio manager may place separate transactions for one or more funds or other accounts which may affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the detriment of one or more other funds or accounts with respect to securities transactions for calvert large cap growth the subadvisor determines which broker to use to execute each order consistent with its duty to seek best execution of the transaction the subadvisor may place separate nonsimultaneous transactions for the fund and another mutual fund or account that may temporarily affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the detriment of the fund or the other mutual fund or account the subadvisor seeks to mitigate this problem through a random rotation of order in the allocation of executed trades with respect to securities transactions for the fund the subadvisor determines which broker to use to execute each order consistent with its duty to seek best execution of the transaction however with respect to certain other accounts such as other pooled investment vehicles that are not registered mutual funds and other accounts managed for organizations and individuals the subadvisor may be limited by the client with respect to the selection of brokers in these cases the subadvisor or its affiliates may place separate nonsimultaneous transactions for the fund and another mutual fund or account that may temporarily affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the detriment of the fund or the other mutual fund or account the appearance of a conflict of interest may arise where the subadvisor has an incentive such as a performance based management fee similar to that charged calvert large cap growth or other differing fee structure which relates to the management of one fund or other account but not all funds and accounts with respect to which a portfolio manager has daytoday management responsibilities the subadvisor has adopted certain compliance policies and procedures that are designed to address these types of conflicts however there is no guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation in which an actual or potential conflict may arise calvert small cap value and calvert mid cap value channing eric t mckissack cfa and wendell e mackey cfa when a portfolio manager has responsibility for managing more than one account potential conflicts of interest may arise those conflicts could include preferential treatment of one account over others in terms of allocation of resources or of investment opportunities channing has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential material conflicts for instance portfolio managers within channing are normally responsible for all accounts within a certain investment discipline and do not absent special circumstances differentiate among the various accounts when allocating resources additionally channing utilizes a system pro rata for allocating investment opportunities among portfolios that is designed to provide a fair and equitable allocation whenever a portfolio manager manages other accounts including accounts that pay higher fees or accounts that pay performancebased fees potential conflicts of interest exist including potential conflicts between the investment strategy of the fund and the investment strategy of the other accounts and potential conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities between the fund and such other accounts channing believes several factors limit the presence of conflicts between the fund and other similar stock accounts managed by the portfolio management team or individual members of the team first discipline and constraints are imposed because the investment programs of the fund and other similar accounts are determined based on quantitative models second all portfolio management team members are aware of and abide by channings trade allocation procedures which seek to ensure fair allocation of investment opportunities among all accounts performance attribution with full transparency of holdings and identification of contributors to gains and losses act as important controls on conflicts that might otherwise exist where similar accounts are traded in a common trading environment performance dispersion among accounts employing the same investment strategy but with different fee structures is periodically examined by channings portfolio managers and its investment team to ensure that any divergence in expected performance is adequately explained by differences in the clients investment guidelines and timing of cash flows c compensation of portfolio managers of the funds set forth below are the structure of and method used to determine  the cash and noncash compensation received by each portfolio manager from a fund the advisor or subadvisor if any of the fund or any other sources with

believes that healthy corporations are characterized by sound corporate governance and overall corporate social responsibility the wellgoverned company meets high standards of corporate ethics and operates in the best interests of shareowners the socially responsible company meets high standards of corporate ethics and operates in the best interests of other stakeholders employees customers communities and the environment in our view companies that combine good governance and corporate social responsibility are better positioned for longterm success these proxy voting guidelines the guidelines reflect calverts view that our fiduciary obligations to our shareholders include an obligation to vote their proxies in a manner consistent with  good corporate governance and  corporate social responsibility the attributes of wellgoverned socially responsible companies that these proxyvoting guidelines seek to promote are longterm value responsible healthy companies are those that focus on longterm value creation that aligns the interests of management with those of shareowners and other stakeholders good governance is likely to be compromised when a company becomes myopic focusing on current earnings expectations and other shortterm goals rather than the fundamental soundness of the enterprise over the longer term a focus on longterm value creation also increases the relevance of companies environmental management treatment of workers and communities and other social variables just as a shortterm focus on earnings performance can compromise longterm shareowner interests so can poor treatment of workers communities the environment or other stakeholders create shortterm gain while increasing risks and compromising performance over the longer term calverts proxy voting guidelines support governance structures and policies that keep the focus of company management on longterm corporate health and sustainable financial social and environmental performance accountability corporate management must be accountable to many interests including investors stakeholders and regulators management of a company must be accountable to the board of directors the board must be accountable to the companys shareowners and the board and management together must be accountable to the stakeholders some governance structures by their very nature weaken accountability including corporations that are too insulated from possible takeovers certain other governance structures are well suited to manage this accountability independent boards that represent a wide variety of interests and perspectives full disclosure of company performance on financial environmental and social metrics charters bylaws and procedures that allow shareholders to express their wishes and concerns and compensation structures that work to align the interests and timeframes of management and owners calverts proxy voting guidelines support structures that create and reinforce accountability and oppose those that do not sustainability wellgoverned companies are those whose operations are financially socially and environmentally sustainable sustainability requires fair treatment of shareholders and other stakeholders in order to position the company for continued viability and growth over time effective corporate governance like national governance cannot indefinitely ignore or exploit certain groups or interests to the benefit of others without incurring mounting risks for the corporation for example companies that provide excessive compensation to executives at the expense of other employees and shareowners are creating risks that may be expressed in rising employee turnover or activist campaigns targeting corporate practices companies that fail to account for potential liabilities associated with climate change may be creating risks that will be expressed in costly government regulation or uninsured catastrophic losses calverts proxy voting guidelines aim to support sustainable governance that attends fairly to the interests of shareowners workers communities and the environment as a longterm equity investor calvert strives to encourage corporate responsibility which includes respectful treatment of workers suppliers customers and communities environmental stewardship product integrity and high standards of corporate ethics as well as more traditional measures of sound corporate governance companies that combine good governance and social responsibility strive to avoid unnecessary financial risk while serving the interests of both shareowners and stakeholders in our view good governance  social responsibility  corporate responsibility on behalf of our shareholders calvert funds generally vote our proxies in accordance with the positions set forth in these proxy voting guidelines the guidelines the guidelines are not meant to be exhaustive nor can they anticipate every potential voting issue on which the funds may be asked to cast their proxies there also may be instances when the advisor calvert asset management company votes the funds shares in a manner that does not strictly adhere to or is inconsistent with these guidelines if doing so is in the best interests of the funds shareholders also to the extent that the guidelines do not address potential voting issues the funds delegate to the appropriate advisor the authority to act on its behalf to promote the applicable funds investment objectives and social goals to the extent the funds vote proxies in a manner not strictly in accordance with these guidelines and such votes present a potential conflict of interest the funds will proceed in accordance with section iii below when support for or opposition to a proxy proposal as described below is qualified with the term ordinarily this means that the fund advisor generally foresees voting all shares as described except in special circumstances where the advisor determines that a contrary vote may be in the best interests of fund shareholders when support for or opposition to a proxy proposal is qualified by the expression on a case by case basis this means that the fund advisor cannot determine in advance whether such proposals are generally in the best interests of fund shareholders and will reserve judgment until such time as the specific proposal is reviewed and evaluated when we use the term shareholder we are referring to calverts mutual fund shareholders whose proxy votes we cast in accordance with these guidelines when we use the term shareowner we are referring to the equity owners of stock in publicly traded corporations calvert appreciates that issues brought to shareholders may change over time as both investors concerns and rules governing inclusion of specific items in corporate proxies change corporate governance laws and best practices codes are continuously evolving worldwide we have constructed these proxy voting guidelines to be both general enough and sufficiently flexible to adapt to such changes internationally corporate governance codes have more in common with each other than do the laws and cultures of the countries in which the companies are domiciled in light of these different regulatory contexts the fund advisor will assess both best practices in the country in question and consistency with the funds guidelines prior to voting proxies to that end we have not attempted to address every specific issue that may arise on a proxy ballot calverts proxy voting record is available on the funds web site wwwcalvertcom and will after august   also be available on the securities and exchange commissions website at wwwsecgov i corporate governance a board and governance issues board of directors the board of directors the board is responsible for the overall governance of the corporation including representing the interests of shareowners and overseeing the companys relationships with other stakeholders while company boards in most countries do not have a statutory responsibility to protect stakeholders the duties of care and loyalty encompass the brand financial and reputational risks that can result from inadequate attention to stakeholder interests thus in our view a boards fiduciary duties encompass stakeholder relations as well as protecting shareowner interests one of the most fundamental sources of good governance is independence directors who have financial or other affiliations with companies on whose boards they serve may face conflicts of interest between their own interests and those of the corporations shareowners and other stakeholders in our view the board should be composed of a majority of independent directors and key committees including the audit compensation and nominating andor governance committees should be composed exclusively of independent directors independent directors are those who do not have a material financial or personal relationship with the company or any of its managers that could compromise the directors objectivity and fiduciary responsibility to shareowners in general this means that an independent director should have no affiliation with the company other than a seat on the board and in some cases ownership of sufficient company stock to give the director a stake in the companys financial performance but not so great as to constitute a controlling or significant interest a significant difference between governance structures among different countries involves board structure there are some countries for example germany austria and the netherlandsthat use a twotiered board structure companies in these countries have supervisory boards and management boards supervisory boards are made up of nonexecutives and management boards are comprised of executives because the boards ability to represent shareowners independently of management can be compromised when the chair is also a member of management it can sometimes be beneficial for the chair of the board be an independent director another critical component of good governance is diversity wellgoverned companies benefit from a wide diversity of perspective and background on their boards to bring such diversity to the board directors should be chosen to reflect diversity of experience perspective expertise gender race culture and geography calverts goal in addressing board diversity is to assure that boards of directors fairly represent the concerns of both shareholders and stakeholders stakeholders include employees communities vendors and customers and as such include people of color and racial minorities who have historically faced discrimination or denial of opportunities solely on account of their race even well governed corporations may risk perpetuating this historic injustice if boards of directors are not inclusive and diverse companies that are private may take some time to achieve an adequate balance of diversity and independence on their boards for private companies the fund advisor will vote on a casebycase basis on board independence and board diversity matters each director should also be willing and able to devote sufficient time and effort to the duties of a director ordinarily this means that directors should not sit on more than two other boards of publicly traded companies unless personal circumstances allow sufficient time to devote to corporate governance on several boards directors who routinely fail to attend board meetings regardless of the number of boards on which they serve are not devoting sufficient attention to good corporate governance the board should periodically evaluate its performance the performance of it various committees and the performance of individual board members in governing the corporation the fund advisor will oppose slates of directors without at least a majority of independent directors the fund advisor will oppose slates of directors that result in a board that does not include both women and people of color and may oppose slates of directors that include women and people of color should the advisor conclude that the presence of women and people of color on the board constitutes mere token representation the fund advisor will support proposals requesting that companies adopt policies or nominating committee charters to assure that diversity is a key attribute of every director search the fund advisor will support proposals requesting that the majority of directors be independent and that the board audit compensation andor nominating committees be composed exclusively of independent directors the fund advisor will examine on a casebycase basis proposals seeking to separate the positions of chair of the board and chief executive officer as well as resolutions asking for the chair to be an independent director the fund advisor may oppose slates of directors in situations where the company failed to take action on shareowner proposals that passed in previous years the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose director candidates who have not attended a sufficient number of meetings of the board or key committees on which they served to effectively discharge their duties as directors the fund advisor will support proposals calling for a systematic and transparent board election and nominating regime classified or staggered boards on a classified or staggered board directors are divided into separate classes with directors in each class elected to overlapping threeyear terms companies argue that such boards offer continuity in strategic direction which promotes longterm planning however in some instances these structures may deter legitimate efforts to elect new directors or takeover attempts that may benefit shareowners a classified board structure may also tend to depress stock price if viewed as an antitakeover measure the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals to elect all board members annually and to remove classified boards increase authorized common stock companies may choose to increase their authorization of common stock for a variety of reasons in some instances the intended purpose of the increased authorization may clearly benefit shareowners in others the benefits to shareowners are less clear given that increased authorization of common stock is dilutive except where the authorization is being used to facilitate a stock split or stock dividend proposed increases in authorized common stock must be examined carefully to determine whether the benefits of issuing additional stock outweigh the potential dilution the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals authorizing the issuance of additional common stock necessary to facilitate a stock split the fund advisor will examine and vote on a caseby case basis proposals authorizing the issuance of additional common stock if the company already has a large amount of stock authorized but not issued or reserved for its stock option plans or where the request is to increase shares by more than  percent of the current authorization the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose the proposals unless there is a convincing business plan for use of additional authorized common stock due to concerns that the authorized but unissued shares will be used as a poison pill or other takeover defense blank check preferred stock blank check preferred stock is stock with a fixed dividend and a preferential claim on company assets relative to common shares the terms of the stock voting dividend and conversion rights are set by the board at a future date without further shareowner action while such an issue can in theory have legitimate corporate purposes most often it has been used as an antitakeover device the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose the creation of blank check preferred stock in addition the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose increases in authorization of preferred stock with unspecified terms and conditions of use that may be determined by the board at a future date without approval of shareholders supermajority vote requirements supermajority vote requirements in a companys charter or bylaws require a level of voting approval in excess of a simple majority generally supermajority provisions require at least  affirmative votes for passage of issues the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose supermajority vote requirements restrictions on shareowners acting by written consent written consent allows shareowners to initiate and carry out a shareowner action without waiting until the annual meeting or by calling a special meeting it permits action to be taken by the written consent of the same percentage of outstanding shares that would be required to effect the proposed action at a shareowner meeting the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals to limit or eliminate the right of shareowners to act by written consent restrictions on shareowners calling meetings it is common for company management to retain the right to call special meetings of shareowners at any time but shareowners often do not have similar rights in general we support the right of a majority of shareowners to call special meetings even in extraordinary circumstances such as consideration of a takeover bid restrictions on the right of a majority of shareowners to call a meeting can also restrict the ability of shareowners to force company management to consider shareowner proposals or director candidates the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose restrictions on the right of shareowners to call special meetings as such restrictions limit the right of shareowners to participate in governance limitations director liability and indemnification because of increased litigation brought against directors of corporations and the increased costs of directors liability insurance many states have passed laws limiting director liability for actions taken in good faith it is argued that such indemnification is necessary for companies to be able to attract the most qualified individuals to their boards in addition many companies are seeking to add indemnification of directors to corporate bylaws the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals seeking to indemnify directors and limit director liability for acts excluding fraud or other wanton or willful misconduct or illegal acts but will oppose proposals seeking to indemnify directors for all acts reincorporation corporations are bound by the laws of the states in which they are incorporated companies reincorporate for a variety of reasons including shifting incorporation to a state where the company has its most active operations or corporate headquarters in other cases reincorporation is done to take advantage of stronger state corporate takeover laws or to reduce tax or regulatory burdens in these instances reincorporation may result in greater costs to stakeholders or in loss of valuable shareowner rights the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals to reincorporate for valid business reasons such as reincorporating in the same state as the corporate headquarters the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals to reincorporate outside the united states if the advisor determines that such reincorporation is no more than the establishment of a skeleton offshore headquarters or mailing address for purposes of tax avoidance and the company does not have substantial business activities in the country in which it proposes to reincorporate cumulative voting cumulative voting allows shareowners to stack their votes behind one or a few directors running for the board thereby helping a minority of shareowners to win board representation cumulative voting gives minority shareowners a voice in corporate affairs proportionate to their actual strength in voting shares however like many tools cumulative voting can be misused in general where shareowner rights and voice are well protected by a strong diverse and independent board and key committees where shareowners may call special meetings or act by written consent and in the absence of strong antitakeover provisions cumulative voting is usually unnecessary the fund advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis proposals calling for cumulative voting in the election of directors dual or multiple classes of stock in order to maintain corporate control in the hands of a certain group of shareowners companies may seek to create multiple classes of stock with differing rights pertaining to voting and dividends creation of multiple classes of stock limits the right of some shareowners  often a majority of shareowners  to exercise influence over the governance of the corporation this in turn diffuses directors incentives to exercise appropriate oversight and control over management the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals to create dual classes of stock however the advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis proposals to create classes of stock offering different dividend rights such as one class that pays cash dividends and a second that pays stock dividends and may support such proposals if they do not limit shareowner rights limit directors tenure corporate directors generally may stand for reelection indefinitely opponents of this practice suggest that limited tenure would inject new perspectives into the boardroom as well as possibly creating room for directors from diverse backgrounds however continuity is also important and there is no empirical support for the proposition that limitations on director tenure improve governance it may be in the best interests of the shareowners for longserving directors to remain on the board providing they maintain their independence as well as the independent perspective they bring to the board accordingly the fund advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis proposals to limit director tenure director stock ownership advocates of requirements that directors own shares of company stock argue that stock ownership helps to align the interests of directors with the interests of shareowners yet there are ways that such requirements may also undermine good governance limiting board service only to those who can afford to purchase shares or encouraging companies to use stock awards as part or all of director compensation in the latter case unless there are mandatory holding requirements or other stipulations that help to assure that director and shareowner incentives are indeed aligned awards of stock as compensation can create conflicts of interest where board members may make decisions for personal gain rather than for the benefit of shareowners thus in some circumstances director stock ownership requirements may be beneficial and in others detrimental to the creation of longterm shareowner value the fund advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis proposals requiring that corporate directors own shares in the company the fund advisor will oppose excessive awards of stock or stock options to directors selection of auditor and audit committee chair annual election of the outside auditors is standard practice while it is recognized that the company is in the best position to evaluate the competence of the outside auditors we believe that outside auditors must ultimately be accountable to shareowners a report released by the blue ribbon commission on improving the effectiveness of corporate audit committees in conjunction with the nyse and the national association of securities dealers concluded that audit committees must improve their current level of oversight of independent accountants given recent examples of accounting irregularities that audit panels and auditors failed to detect in calverts view shareowner ratification of independent auditors is an essential step toward restoring investor confidence many of the accounting irregularities in recent years stem from two causes conflicts of interest often arising when certain nonaudit fees are far more lucrative to the audit firms than the contracts for independent corporate audits and misstatement of earnings eg use of onetime charges offbalancesheet entities or utilizing unrealistic projections of portfolio returns as a justifications for underfunding company pension plans and overstating earnings a number of countries now call for disclosure of payments for nonaudit services others have established limits on the percentage of nonaudit income that auditors can earn from one client some regulations go so far as to ban nonaudit work for auditors the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals seeking ratification of the auditor when fees for nonaudit consulting services exceed audit fees or in any other case where the advisor determines that the independence of the auditor may be compromised the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals that call for more stringent measures to ensure auditor independence in a number of countries including spain italy and japan companies routinely appoint internal statutory auditors the fund advisor will ordinarily support the appointment or reelection of internal statutory auditors unless there are concerns about audit methods used or the audit reports produced or if there are questions regarding the auditors being voted on in some countries shareholder election of auditors is not common practice the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals that call for the annual election of auditors by shareholders the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals seeking ratification of the audit committee chair if the audit committee recommends an auditor whose nonaudit consulting services exceed audit fees or in any other case where the advisor determines that the independence of the auditor may be compromised the fund advisor will otherwise vote on a casebycase basis proposals seeking ratification of the audit committee chair and may oppose ratification when the advisor believes the company has used overly aggressive or other unrealistic assumptions in financial reporting that overstate or otherwise distort its earnings from ongoing operations transparency and disclosure international corporate governance is changing rapidly and there has been a wave of development of governance codes around the world in response to crises such as the asian financial crash in the late s and the united states accounting scandal in fact there are approximately forty different codes in the eu member countries alone however the common thread throughout all of these codes is that shareowners want their companies to be transparent the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals that call for full disclosure of company financial performance the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals that call for an annual financial audit by external and independent auditors the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals that call for disclosure of ownership structure and objectives of companies including the rights of minority shareholders vis�vis the rights of major shareholders the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals calling for disclosure of corporate governance codes and structures the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals that call for disclosure of related party transactions the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals that call for disclosure of the board nominating process charter and bylaws there may be proposals involving changes to corporate charters or bylaws that are not otherwise addressed in or anticipated by these guidelines the fund advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis proposals to amend or change corporate charter or bylaws and may support such proposals if they are deemed consistent with shareholders best interests and the principles of sound governance and overall corporate social responsibility underlying these guidelines expensing of stock options the treatment of stock options in corporate financial reporting has been a subject of much debate in recent years the majority of companies that make extensive use of stock optionsparticularly when used as a key component of executive compensationtake no charge on their financial statements for issuance of such options yet with the rapid growth of executive stock options as a major source of executive compensation there have been renewed calls for revision of current accounting standards that allow companies to choose between recording fair value or intrinsic value of those options it is likely that companies will be required to expense stock options sometime in the near future until that time it remains calverts view that the expensing of stock options gives shareholders valuable additional information about companies financial performance and should therefore be encouraged the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals requesting that companies expense stock options b executive and employee compensation in  ceo compensation was  times greater than the average worker by  ceos were paid  times more than their average employees according to the aflcio if the rate of growth of executive compensation were to continue the average ceos salary would equal that of about  american factory workers in the year  the size of ceo compensation is simply out of hand business week  the problem is not limited to ceos excessive executive compensation has become a widespread problem throughout american industry in too many situations corporate executives are essentially insured against downside risk while enjoying a disproportionate share of upside gain the significant increase in the use of stock options for executive compensation that began in the s also created strong incentives for executives to use their insider knowledge for shortterm personal gain and to increase the value of their options by in many cases concealment or selective disclosure of material information executive risks and rewards need to be better aligned with those of employees shareowners and the longterm performance of the corporation prosperity should be shared broadly within a company as should the downside risk of share ownership executive compensation packages should also be transparent and shareowners should have the right and responsibility to vote on major stock option and other incentive plans stock option plans transfer significant amounts of wealth from shareowners to highly paid executives and directors reasonable limits must be set on dilution caused by such plans which should be designed to provide incentives as opposed to riskfree rewards disclosure of ceo executive board and management compensation the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals requesting companies to disclose the compensationincluding salaries option awards bonuses and restricted stock grantsof top management and the board of directors compensation for ceo executive board and management the fund advisor will oppose executive compensation proposals if we determine that the compensation does not reflect the financial economic and social circumstances of the company ie during times of financial strains or underperformance formation and independence of compensation review committee the fund advisor will support proposals requesting the formation of a committee of independent directors to regularly review and examine executive compensation stock options for board and executives during the s the use of stock options in executive compensation soared while the stock market was gaining few investors complained yet after the fall of the market executive compensation and the use of optionbased compensation in particular continued to increase at levels that seemed disconnected from the change in companies financial fortunes many investors began to question whether stock option grants to senior executives were serving their intended function of aligning the interests of company management with those of shareowners boards are beginning to scrutinize executive compensation more carefully but there are still many companies whose executive compensation seems disconnected from the actual performance of the corporation and creation of shareowner value many boards continue to approve option repricing packages that allow executives to avoid downside risk and exercise options at favorable prices further weakening the alignment between management interests and shareowner interests repricing can in some cases serve to strengthen the alignment for example when options are offered broadly to middle managers and employees as well as top executives or when repricing reduces potential dilution the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals to approve stock option plans in which the dilutive effect exceeds  percent of share value or for companies with small market capitalization  percent of share value option grants that exceed these thresholds will be examined and voted on a casebycase basis to evaluate whether there are valid business reasons for the grants the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals to approve stock option plans that contain provisions for automatic repricing unless such plans contain provisions to limit unrestricted resale of shares purchased with repriced options the fund advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis proposals for repricing of underwater options the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals to approve stock option plans that have option exercise prices below the market price on the day of the grant the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals requiring that all option plans and option repricing must be submitted for shareholder approval the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals to approve stock option plans with evergreen features reserving a specified percentage of stock for award each year with no termination date the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals to approve stock option plans for outside directors subject to the same constraints previously described employee stock ownership plan esops the fund advisor will support proposals to approve esops created to promote active employee ownership eg those that pass through voting rights on all matters to a trustee or fiduciary who is independent from company management the fund advisor will oppose any esop whose primary purpose is to prevent a corporate takeover pay equity the fund advisor will support proposals requesting that management provide a pay equity report ratio between ceo and worker pay the fund advisor will support proposals requesting that management report on the ratio between ceo and employee compensation the fund advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis proposals requesting management to set a maximum ratio between ceo and employee compensation andor a cap on ceo compensation executive compensation tie to nonfinancial performance the fund advisor will support proposals asking companies to review their executive compensation as it links to nonfinancial performance such as diversity labor and human rights environment community relations and other social issues shareowner access to proxy equal access proposals ask companies to give shareowners access to proxy materials to state their views on contested issues including director nominations in some cases such proposals allow shareowners holding a certain percentage of shares to nominate directors there is no reason why management should be allowed to nominate directors while shareowners  whom directors are supposed to represent  are deprived of the same right at the same time we recognize the countervailing argument that shareowners should not interfere with the ordinary business prerogatives of management on balance however we support the view that shareowners should be granted access to the proxy ballot in the nomination of directors the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals for shareowner access to the proxy ballot golden parachutes golden parachutes are compensation agreements that provide for severance payments to top executives who are terminated or demoted pursuant to a takeover or other change in control companies argue that such provisions are necessary to keep executives from jumping ship during potential takeover attempts while calvert recognizes the merits of this argument golden parachutes often impede takeover attempts that we believe shareowners have the right and the responsibility to consider the fund advisor will support proposals providing shareowners the right to ratify adoption of golden parachute agreements the fund advisor will examine and vote s on a casebycase basis golden parachute contracts based upon an evaluation of the particular golden parachute itself and taking into consideration total management compensation the employees covered by the plan quality of management size of the payout and any leveraged buyout or takeover restrictions the fund adviser will oppose the election of directors who vote to approve golden parachutes that are not ratified by shareowners c mergers acquisitions spinoffs and other corporate restructuring mergers and acquisitions frequently raise significant issues of corporate strategy and as such should be considered very carefully by shareowners mergers in particular may have the effect of profoundly changing corporate governance for better or worse as two corporations with different cultures traditions and strategies become one considering the nonfinancial effects of a merger proposal such proposals allow or require the board to consider the impact of merger decisions on various stakeholders including employees communities of place or interest customers and business partners and give the board the right to reject a tender offer on the grounds that it would adversely affect the companys stakeholders the fund advisor will support proposals that consider nonfinancial impacts of mergers the fund advisor will examine and vote on a casebycase basis all merger and acquisition proposals and will support those that offer value to shareowners while protecting or improving the companys social and environmental performance the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose proposals for corporate acquisition takeover restructuring plans that include significant new takeover defenses or that merge a nonnuclear and a nuclear utility or that pose other potential financial social or environmental risks or liabilities poison pills poison pills or shareowner rights plans are triggered by an unwanted takeover attempt and cause a variety of events to occur which may make the company financially less attractive to the suitor typically directors have enacted these plans without shareowner approval most poison pill resolutions deal with shareowner ratification of poison pills or repealing them altogether the fund advisor will support proposals calling for shareowner approval of poison pills or shareholder rights plans the fund advisor will ordinarily oppose poison pills or shareowner rights plans unless management is able to present a convincing case for a particular plan that does not significantly compromise shareowner rights or interests or environmental and social performance greenmail greenmail is the premium a takeover target firm offers to a corporate raider in exchange for the raiders shares this usually means that the bidders shares are purchased at a price higher than market price discriminating against other shareowner the fund advisor will ordinarily support antigreenmail provisions and oppose the payment of greenmail optout of state antitakeover law several states have enacted antitakeover statutes to protect companies against hostile takeovers in some directors or shareowners are required to opt in for such provisions to be operational in others directors or shareowners may opt out hostile takeovers come in many forms some offer advantages to shareowners by replacing current management with more effective management others do not shareowners of both the acquirer and the target firms stand to lose or gain significantly depending on the terms of the takeover the strategic attributes of the takeover and the price and method of acquisition in general shareowners should have the right to consider all potential takeovers hostile or not and vote their shares based on their assessment of the particular offer the fund advisor will ordinarily support proposals for bylaw changes allowing a company to opt out of state antitakeover laws and will oppose proposals requiring companies to opt into state antitakeover statutes � corporate social responsibility a sustainability reporting the

earths temperature will rise between  and  degrees fahrenheit over the next century unless there is a dramatic  to  percent reduction in co emissions failure to address this developing ecological catastrophe will likely mean rising sea levels melting polar ice caps coastal erosion increasingly dramatic storms floods and other natural disasters as well as accelerating species losses and habitat extinctions shareholder initiatives on climate change have focused on companies that contribute significantly to global warmingincluding oil and mining companies utilities and automobile manufacturers

will ordinarily support resolutions asking companies to create or expand upon relocation programs for displaced workers d product safety and impact many companies products have significant impacts on

operations was not well known or reported but increasingly company operations in countries with substandard labor or human rights records has come under much greater scrutiny the adverse publicity associated with allegations of sweatshop practices or other human rights abuses can also pose substantial brand or reputational risks for companies many of the shareowner resolutions filed on international operations and human rights focus on specific countries or specific issues within them for example shareowners have in the past asked companies to commit themselves to uphold the south african council of churches code of conduct for corporations doing business in south africa or to report on or comply with the macbride principles aimed at eliminating religious discrimination in northern ireland in other cases resolutions have requested that companies report on operations or cease operations in particular nations with repressive regimes or a history of human rights and labor

banks have often insisted on belttightening and other restructuring measures that can result in high inflation rising unemployment and social instability some advocates have argued for the forgiveness of such loans in order to promote social and economic gains for millions of citizens in developing nations forgiveness however may also result in unacceptable loss to lending institutions and their shareowners proposals calling for debt forgiveness to developing countries may have some merit if there is a reasonable prospect that with forgiveness the countries can rebuild economic security and
