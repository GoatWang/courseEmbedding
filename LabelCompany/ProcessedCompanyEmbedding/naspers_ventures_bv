plants a flag in us with new venture group posted may   by connie loizos cookie  shares next story software piracy claims can ruin your business and reward those responsible naspers the yearold internet and entertainment group is finally planting a flag in the us establishing a naspers ventures unit that will operate largely out of san francisco the person company which is based in cape town south africa and tends to focus on less developed markets including latin america africa india and even russia said its decision to come to the us owes to a few factors the first is organizational though naspers is one of the most active investors in the world – it committed  billion to companies last year including avito an online classified ads company in moscow — the company has created smaller operating companies around certain sectors where it has a wealth of bets some of those sectors and bets include ecommerce flipkart online retail allegro online classifieds including mailru and olx social networking tencent and payments payu “we’ve gotten wellrepresented in those areas” says naspers ceo bob van dijk “but we also realized that to prepare for our next phase of growth we want to be focused on other new consumer needs that are being transformed by tech” and to do it via a dedicated ventures unit indeed this morning naspers ventures is announcing it has led a  million series b investment in the social learning network brainly — a deal that represents the first ed tech investment for naspers sevenyearold brainly was founded in kraków poland and now has a second office in new york larry iilg a former ebay and trulia executive who joined naspers in late  and is now ceo of naspers ventures says another reason naspers is coming to the us is to help its many farflung startups get a foothold here “we’re looking to support existing companies that aren’t in the us but that want to attract talent here and potentially bring their models here as well” he says not last adds illg naspers thinks it can aid us companies operating in what illg views as underfunded sectors to “go global very quickly” thanks to naspers’ existing infrastructure naspers ventures which is putting together an office with up to  support staff will be investing off naspers’ balance sheet for now in fact the unit has already quietly made a handful of investments including in letgo a mobile only classifieds site in which naspers invested  million last fall letgo was founded by alec oxenford who’d previously founded olx naspers initially acquired a majority stake in olx in  over time it increased its position to  percent olx has since been entering new markets at a rapid clip in a bid to become the world’s largest consumertoconsumer marketplace letgo appears to be following a similar playbook as techcrunch reported yesterday letgo and wallapop — both online classifieds companies that were started in barcelona — are in advanced talks to merge operations in the us to better
