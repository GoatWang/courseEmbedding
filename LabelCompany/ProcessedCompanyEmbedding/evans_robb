restart operations september   leave a comment arizonabased vemma nutrition co had its day in court sept  making its case and asking judge john j tuchi to lift or modify the terms of the court order that has put a halt to the company’s business in august the federal trade commission sued vemma accusing the company of being a pyramid scheme making false and misleading income claims and failing to provide appropriate income disclosures the ftc requested and received an ex parte temporary restraining order with asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver which meant vemma executives did not have an opportunity to offer a defense prior to the order being issued the ftc has asked the judge to extend the government’s control of the company with a preliminary injunction it is the first significant ftc action in the direct selling space since the ninth circuit of the us court of appeals’  ruling that burnlounge inc was an illegal pyramid scheme the court’s final decision will join existing case law in shaping the legal standards that govern direct selling in the united states and may provide new insight into how federal regulators view the distribution channel the more immediate issue for vemma however is that the temporary receiver appointed in the case has shut down all company operations including its international business units and retail sales “there is no doubt that if this injunction is left in place we are never going back” vemma’s counsel said in his closing summary before the judge the temporary restraining order expires at  pm local time on friday sept 8 and judge tuchi said he will issue his ruling before that deadline the courtroom was packed for the allday hearing which included cross examination of witnesses on both sides of the case ftc investigator matthew thacker professor stacie bosley who provided an analysis of vemma’s compensation plan for the ftc truth in advertising executive director bonnie patten kenton johnson executive vice president of robb evans  associates the temporary receiver currently running the company professor emre carr vemma’s compensation analysis expert allison tengan vemma’s vice president of legal affairs and vemma coo brad wayment during the hearing the ftc continued to shape a sweeping case that vemma’s compensation plan improperly paid affiliates for recruiting and not for product sales to end users its marketing materials made inaccurate income claims and its compliance efforts were ineffective the defense offered testimony to refute those assertions arguing that the government built its case without using actual purchasing data from the company and by cherrypicking often outofdate marketing materials the defense also focused much of its time before the judge on building a case for why the tro should be lifted or modified including establishing that the receiver spent a combined  minutes with company management before deciding that he could not continue any aspect of vemma’s operations under the terms of the tro filed under news us news tagged with allison tengan bk boreyko bonnie patten brad wayment burnlounge compensation plan court direct sales direct selling direct
