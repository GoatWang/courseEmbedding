real estate in  he became vice president of real estate and was appointed to the companys board of directors as the first generation of senior executives began to reach retirement age jenkins and his peers were put into key positions within the company industry insiders noted that this gradual process of turning over power was a key reason that publix remained a consistent presence in the retail food business amid change and supermarket takeovers in the book fifty years of pleasure  pat watters writes that jenkins applied for a job at publix upon completion of his doctorate he wrote his thesis on shoppingcenter development at first his uncle refused to employ him telling jenkins that the grocerystore business was too difficult for the younger man to master jenkins persisted telling his uncle that he had tied up  percent of his personal investments in publix stock and that he wanted to have the chance to turn his investments into large profits his uncle understood that reasoning and put him to work in the realestate division jenkins admitted in an interview for the book that he believed publix was simply the best chance he had for achieving his potential jenkins achieved a reputation equal to his uncles in knowing how to locate stores in profitable areas best place to work under jenkinss leadership publix expanded into the conveniencestore and gasstation market under

companys motto where shopping is always a pleasure noted for his careful planning jenkins established a reputation in his early years for taking meticulous wellplanned steps toward building the company he continued that approach as ceo until  jenkins and the company remained dedicated to the concept of not expanding outside of florida when the economic climate warranted a change however jenkins led the companys expansion into georgia south carolina alabama and tennessee his research and homework in preparing the expansion impressed those watching the fortune  company publix entered the atlanta market in  a research consultant noted that the growth of publix in that area awed industry insiders within a decade the company had gone from having no stores to competing with kroger for dominance in the area when publix moved into tennessee and bought stores from albertsons in  industry insiders were impressed with the thoroughness with which the company entered the market in the nashville area analysts noted that publix contacted the proper regulatory agencies and personally supervised every detail during negotiations and development of the expansion the owners of the company personally attended the meetings and made the phone calls jenkins continued following the original mission of publix to promote highquality food in order to become the best retailer in the world he focused on giving customers value while not tolerating waste jenkins dedicated the business to remaining loyal to its stockholders and taking civic duties seriously in his first year as ceo profits grew  percent with a  percent increase in revenue local residents are quick to praise and defend lakelands largest employer one observer of publixs success noted with a hint of bias that finding a disgruntled employee was impossible andrew wolf an analyst at bbt capital markets in richmond virginia told progressive grocer in  that one of the reasons for employee loyalty were the incentives employees had as owners of the company in  for the seventh consecutive year publix received recognition as one of fortune magazines top one hundred companies to work for this designation was determined by a survey of randomly selected employees that asked about management peer relationships and pride in working for publix jenkins told fortune  it is thrilling to know that our associates still consider publix to be one of the best companies to work for in america publix also received the highest scores of any other supermarket for customer satisfaction in a national survey conducted by the american customer satisfaction index in  aggressive strategies bring results jenkins followed established business standards while remaining willing to make changes that made good business sense for example he began a new policy in the 0s while still working in the real estate division that saved the company time and money when jenkins began as vice president of real estate in  publix owned  percent of its locations according to company records in 0 it owned only one in six jenkins remain committed to the companys focus on carefully determining each stores location when he could not find a developer to build and lease on a favorable site publix would build the store itself jenkins remarked in fifty years of pleasure that locating developers to build stores was easy because of publixs reputation they know that having a good merchant in their shopping center is going to make it a more successful one in  progressive grocer compared publix to walt disney world in orlando like the renowned amusement park publix created a clean and pleasant experience for the shopper the magazine noted that building loyalty among its customers left publix with a heritage and its customers with a tradition familyowned business earns respect publix developed a loyalty among its customers in florida the industry regarded publix as a wellrun supermarket chain a view that continued under jenkinss leadership he did not waiver from his familys philosophy in providing a pleasant place to shop and work as a result publix became one of the most respected familyrun businesses in the united states as expansion occurred outside the state of florida the same loyal following occurred when jenkins stopped the loyalty discountcard program analysts initially wondered if the strategy would work later they conceded that the move had been successful because publix had other strengths that its customers admired andrew wolf noted in progressive grocer that a loyalty card is not powerful enough to trump what they offer which is better merchandising better service higher quality and superior facilities february   when the corporate headquarters in lakeland were completed in  observers noted that the 0squarefoot crescentshaped complex reflected the steady growth of publix under the leadership of jenkins and sent a message to the city of lakeland that publix planned to stay in its home

philosophy in providing a pleasant place to shop and work as a result publix became one of the most respected familyrun businesses in the united states as expansion occurred outside the state of florida the same loyal following occurred when jenkins stopped the loyalty discountcard program analysts initially wondered if the strategy would work later they conceded that the move had been successful because publix had other strengths that its customers admired andrew wolf noted in progressive grocer that a loyalty card is not powerful enough to trump what they offer which is better
