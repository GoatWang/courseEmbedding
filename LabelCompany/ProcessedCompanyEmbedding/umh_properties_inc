manufactured homes are quite simply homes that are built completely in a factory and then transported to a home site for placement  though built in a factory these homes offer all of the amenities of a sitebuilt home  they come in wide variety of architectural styles layouts and sizes though most are singlestory homes a single section manufactured home typically offers up to  square feet of living space while a three section home could offer as much as   and because they are built in a factory with the efficiency of the assembly line process manufactured homes are often more affordable than site built homes they are also perfect for landlease scenarios where the homeowner rents only the lot upon which the home is situated   check out just some of the manufactured homes that we offer    all manufactured homes are subject to the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards also known as the hud code established in   these standards many of which are more stringent than standards for site build homes ensure that the homes meet regional standards for safety durability efficiency roof load wind resistance and other important factors  before the home leaves the factory it is carefully inspected to ensure compliance with all aspects of the hud code landlease communities what is a landlease community umh communities are known as landlease communities a landlease community is a housing development where a resident owns or rents a home and leases the lot underneath the home from the landowner the landlease arrangement allows a resident to experience the true
