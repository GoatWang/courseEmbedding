corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of 0 however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a 0 salary and 00 profit the extra taxes on the 00 would be over 0 raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other

suppliers and lenders may look more favorably on your business when youve formed an llc compare llcs and corporations with our business comparison chart disadvantages of an llc creating an llc is an attractive option but there are a few hurdles limited growth potential you cannot issue shares of stock to attract investors lack of uniformity llcs can be treated differently in different states selfemployment tax earnings can be subject to this kind of taxation tax recognition on appreciated assets this could happen if you convert an existing business to an llc one more way that extra taxation can occur is creating an llc right for me that really depends on what your shortterm and longterm business goals are we recommend that you put some thought into where your business is now and how you want your business to grow before deciding whether the llc structure is right for you how to form an llc limited liability company choose a legal name and reserve it if the secretary of state in your state does that sort of thing not all do draft and file your articles of incorporation with your secretary of state decide who will run the business managers or members decide how many owners are in the business apply for a business license and other certificates specific to your industry file form ss or apply online at the internal revenue service website to obtain an employer identification number ein apply for any other id numbers required by state and local government agencies requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another but generally your business most likely will

services is that possible i need additional help – can you give me more guidance i had some legal questions come up can you assist how does forming an llc help protect my personal assets unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships llcs allow their owners to separate and protect their personal assets from business debts and liabilities a sole proprietor or general partner remains personally liable for business obligations leaving their home car and personal savings at risk in contrast forming an llc creates a business structure separate from its owners in a properly formed and managed llc only business assets remain at risk in a judgment against the company owners can protect their personal savings and possessions from business debts back to top how are llc profits taxed like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc enjoys passthrough taxation this means that owners also known as members report their share of profits or losses in the company on their individual tax returns the internal revenue service irs does not assess taxes on the company itself this avoids the double taxation that general or c corporations experience in a c corporation the irs taxes profits at the corporate level and dividends at the shareholder level when creating an llc owners need not distribute profits and losses in the llc in proportion to ownership pursuant to irs guidelines the owners of an llc can agree to allocate the companys profits and losses among themselves however they see fit not necessarily based on the percentage of the company each owner controls back to top how does an llc compare to a c corporation for many small business owners a limited liability company llc offers advantages over a c corporation also known as a general corporation creating an llc combines the tax advantages of a sole proprietorship or partnership with the liability protection of a corporation the irs taxes the profits of a c corporation at corporate tax rates then if the c corporation pays dividends to shareholders the irs taxes those dividends a second time at the personal income tax rates of the shareholders the llc business structure avoids this double taxation the internal revenue service irs does not consider an llc itself a taxable entity instead the companys earnings pass through to the owners who report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns small business owners who want the flexible structure of an llc but the advantages of corporate taxation can elect corporate taxation for their llc to elect corporate taxation owners file form  tax classification election with the irs electing this status may also make an llc eligible for certain deductions available only to corporations for specific guidance small business owners should consult their accountant or tax advisor regarding this election back to top how does an llc compare to an s corporation the limited liability company llc and the subchapter s corporation s corp share the benefit of passthrough taxation this means that owners in the company report their share of profits and losses on each owners individual tax return the internal revenue service irs assesses no separate tax on the company itself in contrast double taxation occurs when the irs taxes both a c corporations profit and dividends paid to shareholders despite the similarity of passthrough taxation an llc formation can offer advantages over an s corporation not required to hold annual meetings or record meeting minutes though we recommend it llc owners need not worry about the formalities of issuing stock since an llc does not have stock no limit to the number of owners llc owners need not be us citizens or permanent residents back to top what is a series llc a series llc consists of a limited liability company with more than one series of members managers or llc interests in some cases a series llc can have a separate business purpose or investment objective for years delaware law has permitted an llc to register separate series use of this structure remains uncommon due to uncertainty over federal income tax consequences advantages include the series llc permits separate liabilityinsulated divisions within a single entity a series llc could be used as a holding company owning intangible assets or tangible assets such as real estate or as an operating company

formed an llc compare llcs and corporations with our business comparison chart disadvantages of an llc creating an llc is an attractive option but there are a few hurdles limited growth potential you cannot issue shares of stock to attract investors lack of uniformity llcs can be treated differently in different states selfemployment tax earnings can be subject to this kind of taxation tax recognition on appreciated assets this could happen if you convert an existing business to an llc one more way that extra taxation can occur is creating an llc right for me that really depends on what your shortterm and longterm business goals are we recommend that you put some thought into where your business is now and how you want your business to grow before deciding whether the llc structure is right for you how to form an llc limited liability company choose a legal name and reserve it if the secretary of state in your state does that sort of thing not all do draft and file your articles of incorporation with your secretary of state decide who will run the business managers or members decide how many owners are in the business apply for a business license and other certificates specific to your industry file form ss or apply online at the internal revenue service website to obtain an employer identification number ein apply for any other id numbers required by state and local government agencies requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another but generally your business most likely will be required to pay unemployment disability and other payroll taxes – you will

taxed how does an llc compare to a c corporation how does an llc compare to a s corporation what is a series llc what state should i form my llc in how do i form an llc what do i need to do to maintain my llc can i use incorporatecom as a registered agent if i buy a package but want to customize and add services is that possible i need additional help – can you give me more guidance i had some legal questions come up can you assist how does forming an llc help protect my personal assets unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships llcs allow their owners to separate and protect their personal assets from business debts and liabilities a sole proprietor or general partner remains personally liable for business obligations leaving their home car and personal savings at risk in contrast forming an llc creates a business structure separate from its owners in a properly formed and managed llc only business assets remain at risk in a judgment against the company owners can protect their personal savings and possessions from business debts back to top how are llc profits taxed like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc enjoys passthrough taxation this means that owners also known as members report their share of profits or losses in the company on their individual tax returns the internal revenue service irs does not assess taxes on the company itself this avoids the double taxation that general or c corporations experience in a c corporation the irs taxes profits at the corporate level and dividends at the shareholder level when creating an llc owners need not distribute profits and losses in the llc in proportion to ownership pursuant to irs guidelines the owners of an llc can agree to allocate the companys profits and losses among themselves however they see fit not necessarily based on the percentage of the company each owner controls back to top how does an llc compare to a c corporation for many small business owners a limited liability company llc offers advantages over a c corporation also known as a general corporation creating an llc combines the tax advantages of a sole proprietorship or partnership with the liability protection of a corporation the irs taxes the profits of a c corporation at corporate tax rates then if the c corporation pays dividends to shareholders the irs taxes those dividends a second time at the personal income tax rates of the shareholders the llc business structure avoids this double taxation the internal revenue service irs does not consider an llc itself a taxable entity instead the companys earnings pass through to the owners who report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns small business owners who want the flexible structure of an llc but the advantages of corporate taxation can elect corporate taxation for their llc to elect corporate taxation owners file form  tax classification election with the irs electing this status may also make an llc eligible for certain deductions available only to corporations for specific guidance small business owners should consult their accountant or tax advisor regarding this election back to top how does an llc compare to an s corporation the limited liability company llc and the subchapter s corporation s corp share the benefit of passthrough taxation this means that owners in the company report their share of profits and losses on each owners individual tax return the internal revenue service irs assesses no separate tax on the company itself in contrast double taxation occurs when the irs
