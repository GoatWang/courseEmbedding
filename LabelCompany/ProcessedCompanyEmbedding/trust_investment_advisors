development of equity style portfolios for various asset classes and their application to individual clients portfolios the development of this investing philosophy is identified on the about page the application of this approach is detailed on the equity styles page our fundamental stock research distinguishes tia from many other investment management firms the clients portfolio manager is a member of our investment committee and fully participates in our investing decisions client benefits the relationship with the client is seamless  from initial interview through the specific equity styles chosen to the actual investment decisions made clients receive a monthly statement from their custodian clients also receive a comprehensive quarterly review of their account past performance past performance is no guarantee of future results however tia has realized significant benefits from its proven investment process above sp 00 returns during the lost decade of  to 00 created a new corporate preferred income portfolio for the best quality relative yields designed a covered call strategy to increase client portfolio income as a result of tias innovative investment portfolio services the client base has expanded to brokerage firms to offer these unique services to their clients equity process tias process begins with a database of  stocks and tias investment guidelines tia then selects the equities which qualify for specific equity portfolios from those tia selects the undervalued stocks from that group tia selects those which best suit the equity style at this point in time the sell process is just as important as the buy process tia uses the following criteria for determining when to sell a stock stock achieves target price fundamentals deteriorate opportunity to buy a better stock tia has a policy of staying fully invested at all times and doesnt engage in market timing we do reduce stock market risk by reducing the percentage allocation to equities at times of perceived risk account reviews our investment committee meets on a regular basis to manage the equity style portfolios each equity style is designed to meet a particular investment goal and is incorporated in an overall investment strategy for each client the stock selection research for each equity style has two components a screening to determine stocks meeting tias guidelines for consideration in the specific portfolio and a valuation matrix to determine the relative attractiveness of stocks the guidelines for purchase and sell decisions are identified for each equity style strategies fundamental research tia uses fundamental research analysis as its primary selection method tia applies its own independent and proprietary valuation techniques to determine the attractiveness of a security technical analysis tia uses technical analysis only as a supplement to their investment process technical analysis identifies past market movements and applies those patterns to the present this can show recurring patterns of investor behavior and potentially predict future price movement qualitative analysis tia subjectively evaluates nonquantifiable factors such as quality of management industry sector management attitude towards shareholders strength of research and development and factors not readily subject to measurement which help predict changes to share price based on that data   trust investment advisors tia  a registered investment advisory firm 0 woodfield crossing boulevard suite 00 indianapolis in 60  industry disclosures a concrete
