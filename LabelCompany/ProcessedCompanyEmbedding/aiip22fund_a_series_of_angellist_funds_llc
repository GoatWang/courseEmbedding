introduction to angellist funds  early investing toggle navigation sign in search for sign in search for adam sharp  years ago introduction to angellist part ii funds editor’s note this is part  of a series on angellist part  covers everything you need to know about investing in startups online through angelco i suggest reading it first if you haven’t yet there’s some important background information there in this letter we’ll look at angellist funds a new way to build a portfolio of startup investments happy new year readers when it comes to earlystage investing i’ve found there are generally two theories they boil down to this spread out your bets across many promising startups to maximize the chance of hitting a grand slam help companies when you can focus your investments in a select few startups per year then help them succeed billionaire peter thiel is a big proponent of the second option a focused approach and it’s worked well for the cofounder of paypal he sold his early  stake in facebook for  billion in  that one was good for  times his investment he’s made many successful highly focused investments since but what works well for elite silicon valley vcs like peter isn’t for everyone to succeed with a highly targeted approach you need millions dedicated to earlystage investments having a toptier network in the valley sure comes in handy when helping companies scale and it wouldn’t hurt to have the deep experience that comes from turning a startup into a billiondollar monster… for the rest of us i believe a diversified approach is better and angellist has a new line of funds designed for just this each fund will invest in approximately  startups listed on angellist the current funds are built around themes the enterprise fund will invest in startups selling a product or service to businesses for example there’s also a healthcare fund a west coast fund and more on the way fund investments are selected by the experienced team at angellist with some help from an advanced computer algorithm according to a recent article in fortune deals are “selected by an algorithm with a bit of human curation on top and may include stealthy startups that are not shown on angellist’s public site” we don’t know exactly how the automated part of funds works i suspect it’s mostly based on the quality of coinvestors so if the lead investor in a deal has an excellent track record the system might tag it for further investigation i’ve invested in a few deals along with angellist funds and whatever they’re doing it seems to be working those deals are some of my favorite picks navdy soothe cabify md insider and others i’d guess that only around one in 5 startups that raise money on angellist is chosen by funds they’re selective i think of these vehicles like actively managed mutual funds they just happen to invest in the first second or third round of a company’s existence more risk higher potential reward how much minimum investments range from  to 5 and you need to be an accredited investor as i mentioned in part  spread out across  startups your stake in each company would be small but at this early stage of investment even  could turn into quite a lot to demonstrate how  could turn into serious money down the road let’s look at angellist’s most wellknown success story to date uber the ondemand taxi service listed its seed financing round on angellist in  at the time it was a totally unproven concept there were a few early signs of its success in the local san francisco market but nothing earthshattering today uber’s valued at  billion investors in that deal have made an estimated  times their investments a  investment would be worth around  today admittedly uber is an extreme example it’s rare that a startup scales that fast in fact most will fail before they get to a series b or c let alone a  billion series e like uber but the uber example does show that angellist and its funds have access to very good deal flow its founders are wellnetworked in the startup capital of the world i’ve seen it firsthand and made over  investments on the platform you can see my profile here and more examples of past angellist deals here we won’t know how these funds will perform for a while seedstage investments take time to grow some startups stay “lean” longer and grow slower some raise a ton of cash and try to scale at warp speed uber many fail it’s the nature of startup investing and it all takes time i think angellist funds will do well they have highquality deal flow which is the critical factor when investing early especially when compared with other investment options out there i think these funds are a solid choice for those who can afford the risk personally i like to choose individual deals but i can see the attraction of a single investment spread across  companies especially if you’d rather not spend hours doing diligence on each deal or don’t feel comfortable picking individual startups you can see a list of current and “coming soon” funds on angellist here answers to questions about fees “carry” and more can be found here i had originally planned to cover angellist’s impressive new hiring tools and “intros” but funds ended up taking over watch for that in a future post good investing adam sharp founder early investing back to articles top posts on

shares next story a run through the chinese pavilion at techcrunch disrupt sf angellist is expanding globally and launching new vehicles for accredited investors to back what amounts to indexed angellist syndicate funds for the top deals on the platform that’s the latest from angellist cofounder naval ravikant and angel investor gil penchina from the stage of disrupt sf  as the angels who along with crunchfund investor and techcrunch founder michael arrington held the audience rapt the angellist platform has grown increasingly robust and through the syndicate vehicles can now invest in — and lead — series a rounds according to navikant “once my first fund got to  million there were people who weren’t able to get into every deal” says penchina “so we launched the saas syndicate… the bitcoin syndicate which is doing two deals the iot syndicate and a late stage syndicate which is going to compete with late stage investors” both penchina and ravikant see angellist as a way to democratize the venture model from top to bottom with the latestage fund the latest shot from angellist across the bow of traditional investors at issue is the dilution that earlystage investors suffer in the highpriced laterstage rounds that have become the norm in silicon valley and beyond in recent years thanks andreessen horowitz as the angellist syndicates grow larger they’re also professionalizing penchina has eight fulltime staff working on his syndicate fund along with another  “volunteers” so far penchina has deployed  million across his syndicates but expects that number to soar to  million over the next  months” ravikant envisions a system that allows an investor’s fund to grow as his experience and track record evolves “it’s a smooth path up to a fund” from angel investment says ravikant “you can add backers as you go” angellist is a way to add leverage to an investor’s checkbook it’s additional firepower to compete against the more established and wellheeled investors in the venture community and he argues it’s a better deal for the limited partners that invest in funds “institutional lps go into individual funds now” he says now that angellist has managed to embed itself in the us ecosystem it’s casting its eye on markets around the world the investment platform is in the process of obtaining regulatory clearance in the uk with plans to move into canadian and australian markets shortly thereafter the only problem with the angellist model is the problem of overtaxing resources both men said “i’m in too many deals now” ravikant said  shares
