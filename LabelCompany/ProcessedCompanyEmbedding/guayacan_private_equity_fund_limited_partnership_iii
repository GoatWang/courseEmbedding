learn how and when to remove this template message a private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity and to a lesser extent debt securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of  years often with annual extensions at inception institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership which is then drawn over the term of the fund from the investors point of view funds can be traditional where all the investors invest with equal terms or asymmetric where different investors have different terms a private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm the general partner and investment advisor typically a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every  to  years as the previous fund is fully invested contents  legal structure and terms  investments and financing  multiples and prices  portfolio company sales exits  investment features and considerations  see also  references  further reading  external links legal structure and termsedit diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or lpa such funds have a general partner gp which raises capital from cashrich institutional investors such as pension plans universities insurance companies foundations endowments and highnetworth individuals which invest as limited partners lps in the fund among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following term of the partnership the partnership is usually a fixedlife investment vehicle that is typically  years plus some number of extensions management fees an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the funds manager to pay for the private equity firms investment operations typically  to  of the committed capital of the fund distribution waterfall  the process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor and allocated between limited and general partner this waterfall includes the preferred return  a minimum rate of return eg  which must be achieved before the general partner can receive any carried interest and the carried interest the share of the profits paid the general partner above the preferred return eg  transfer of an interest in the fund private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded however they can be transferred to another investor typically such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the funds manager restrictions on the general partner the funds manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund however the lpa does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type size or geographic focus of investments permitted and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments the following is

roberts  co kkr kkr  fund lp  billion of commitments alliance boots dollar general energy future holdings corporation first data corp hospital corporation of america hca nielsen company nxp semiconductors investments and financingedit a private equity fund typically makes investments in companies known as portfolio companies these portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from lps and may be partially or substantially financed by debt some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym lbo for leveraged buyout the cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt while billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses such lbo financing most often comes from commercial banks although other financial institutions such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds may also provide financing since mid debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years lbo funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund and sometimes as a consortium of several likeminded funds multiples and pricesedit the acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the companys historical income most often based on the measure of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio companys industry the size of the company and the availability of lbo financing portfolio company sales exitsedit a private equity funds ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return known as internal rate of return irr in excess of the price paid these exit scenarios historically have been an ipo of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition ma also known as a trade sale a sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm also known as a secondary has become common feature of developed private equity markets in prior years another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment sometimes financed with additional debt investment features and considerationsedit considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include substantial entry requirements with most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment usually upwards of  which can be drawn at the managers discretion over the first few years of the fund limited liquidity investments in limited partnership interests the dominant legal form of private equity investments are referred to as illiquid investments which should earn a premium over traditional securities such as stocks and bonds once invested liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investors capital may be lockedup in longterm investments for as long as twelve years distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made investment control nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments typically governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal however in some cases limited partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment unfunded commitments an investors commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor if a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities it will not draw on an investors commitment and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed investment risks given the risks associated with private equity investments an investor can lose all of its investment the risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage by their nature investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies high returns consistent with the risks outlined above private equity can provide high returns with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets for the abovementioned reasons private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money these disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns which may range up to  for successful funds see alsoedit real estate fund special purpose private equity fund history of
