contracts are as follows withdrawal charge as a percentage of premium payments contribution year of premium payment  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent withdrawal charge         withdrawal charge if fiveyear period is elected         applicants legal analysis  section c of the act authorizes the commission to exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from the provisions of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants request that the commission pursuant to section c of the act grant the exemptions requested below with respect to the contracts and any future contracts funded by the separate accounts or other accounts that are issued by the insurance companies and underwritten or distributed by the distributor or affiliated brokerdealers applicants undertake that future contracts funded by the separate accounts or other accounts in the future will be substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  subsection i of section  of the act provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account except as provided in paragraph  of the subsection paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless such contract is a redeemable security section a defines “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of the which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  applicants submit that the recapture of the contract enhancement in the circumstances set forth in this application would not deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets a contract owners interest in the amount of the contract enhancement allocated to his or her contract value upon receipt of a premium payment is not fully vested until five or seven complete years following a premium until or unless the amount of any contract enhancement is vested the insurance companies retain the right and interest in the contract enhancement amount although not in the earnings attributable to that amount thus applicants urge that when the insurance companies recapture any contract enhancement they are simply retrieving their own assets and because a contract owners interest in the contract enhancement is not vested the contract owner has not been deprived of a proportionate share of the separate accounts assets ie a share of the separate accounts assets proportionate to the contract owners contract value  in addition applicants state that it would be patently unfair to allow a contract owner exercising the freelook privilege to retain the contract enhancement amount under a contract that has been returned for a refund after a period of only a few days if the insurance companies could not recapture the contract enhancement applicants claim that individuals could purchase a contract with no intention of retaining it and simply return it for a quick profit furthermore applicants state that the recapture of the contract enhancement relating to withdrawals or receiving income payments within the first five or seven years of a premium contribution is designed to protect the insurance companies against contract owners not holding the contract for a sufficient time period according to applicants it would provide the insurance companies with insufficient time to recover the cost of the contract enhancement to its financial detriment  applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the contract enhancement amount in the separate accounts after the contract enhancements is applied accordingly the assetbased charges applicable to the separate accounts will be assessed against the entire amounts held in the separate accounts including any contract enhancement amounts as a result the aggregate assetbased charges assessed will be higher than those that would be charged if the contract owners contract value did not include any contract enhancement the insurance companies nonetheless represent that the contracts fees and charges in the aggregate are reasonable in relation to service rendered the expenses expected to be incurred and the risks assumed by the insurance companies  applicants represent that the contract enhancement will be attractive to and in the interest of investors because it will permit owners to put   or  of their firstyear premium payments to work for them in the investment divisions and guaranteed accounts in addition the owner will retain any earnings attributable to the contract enhancements recaptured as well as the principal of the contract enhancement amount once vested  applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of any contract enhancement under the contracts do not violate sections a and ia of the act applicants assert that the application of a contract enhancement to premium payments made under the contracts should not raise any questions as to compliance by the insurance companies with the provisions of section i however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants request an exemption from section a and ia to the extent deemed necessary to permit the recapture of any contract enhancement under the circumstances described in the application without the loss of relief from section  provided by section i  section c of the act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section a rule c under the act prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  it is possible that someone might view the insurance companies recapture of the contract enhancements as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the separate accounts applicants contend however that the recapture of the contract enhancement does not violate rule c the recapture of some or all of the contract enhancement does not involve either of the evils that rule c was intended to eliminate or reduce as far as reasonably practicable namely i the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or repurchase at a price above it and ii other unfair results including speculative trading practices to effect a recapture of a contract enhancement the insurance companies will redeem interests in a contract owners contract value at a price determined on the basis of the current net asset value of the separate accounts the amount recaptured will be less than or equal to the amount of the contract enhancement that the insurance companies paid out of its general account assets although contract owners will be entitled to retain any investment gains attributable to the contract enhancement and to bear any investment losses attributable to the contract enhancement the amount of such gains or losses will be determined on the basis of the current net asset values of the separate accounts thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the contract enhancement applicants also submit that the second harm that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the contract enhancement applicants assert that because neither of the harms that rule c was meant to address is found in the recapture of the contract enhancement rule c should not apply to any contract enhancement however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with rule c applicants request an exemption from the provisions of rule c to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the contract enhancement under the contracts  applicants submit that extending the requested relief to encompass future contracts and other accounts is appropriate in the public interest because it promotes competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications prior to introducing new variable annuity contracts investors would receive no benefit or additional protection by requiring applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issues under the act not already addressed in this application applicants further submit for the reasons stated herein that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the act namely that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and that therefore the commission should grant the requested order for the commission by the division

of  to  years jnl new york may also offer other income payment options the contracts may also offer various gmwb optional endorsements  jnl new york will add an additional amount to the owners contract value a “contract enhancement” for the initial premium payment and for each subsequent premium payment received prior to the first contract anniversary following the owners th birthday premium payments will not be accepted on or after the first contract anniversary following the owners th birthday if the owner is age  at issue premium payments will not be accepted on or after the first contract anniversary all contract enhancements are paid from jnl new yorks general account assets the contract enhancement is equal to  of the premium payment  jnl new york will recapture all or a portion of any contract enhancements by imposing a recapture charge whenever an owner i makes a total withdrawal within the recapture charge period nine completed years after a premium payment or a partial withdrawal of corresponding premiums within the recapture charge period in excess of those permitted under the contracts free withdrawal provision unless the withdrawal is made for certain healthrelated emergencies specified in the contracts or ii returns the contract during the freelook period  the amount of the recapture charge varies depending upon when the charge is imposed based on completed years since receipt of the related premium as follows contract enhancement recapture charge as a percentage of premium paymentscompleted years since receipt of premiumrecapture charge  a “completed year” is the succeeding twelve months from the date on which jnl new york receives a premium payment completed years specify the years from the date of receipt of the premium and do not refer to contract years if the premium receipt date is on the issue date of the contract then completed year  does not include the first contract anniversary the first contract anniversary begins completed year  and each successive completed year begins with the contract anniversary of the preceding contract year if the premium receipt date is other than the issue date or a subsequent contract anniversary there is no correlation of the contract anniversary date and completed years for example if the issue date is january   and a premium payment is received on february   then although the first contract anniversary is january   the end of competed year  for that premium payment would be february   and february   begins completed year   the recapture charge percentage will be applied to the corresponding premium reflected in the amount withdrawn that remains subject to a recapture charge the amount recaptured will be taken from the investment divisions and the fixed account in the proportion their respective values bear to the contract value the dollar amount recaptured will never exceed the dollar amount of the contract enhancement added to the contract  jnl new york does not assess the recapture charge on any payments paid out as death benefits income payments withdrawals of earnings withdrawals taken under the free withdrawal provision which allows for free withdrawals up to  of remaining premium less earnings or withdrawals necessary to satisfy the required minimum distribution of the internal revenue code if the withdrawal requested exceeds the required minimum distribution the recapture charge will not be waived on the required minimum distribution  the contract value will reflect any gains or losses attributable to a contract enhancement described above for purposes of determining the recapture charge and withdrawal charge withdrawals will be allocated first to earnings if any which may be withdrawn free of any recapture charge and withdrawal charge second to premium on a firstin firstout basis so that all withdrawals are allocated to premium to which the lowest if any withdrawal charges and recapture charges apply and third to contract enhancements for all purposes other than for tax purposes earnings are defined to be the excess if any of the contract value over the sum of remaining contract enhancements the total contract enhancements reduced by withdrawals of contract enhancements and remaining premiums the total premium reduced by withdrawals that incur withdrawal charges andor recapture charges and withdrawals of premiums that are no longer subject to withdrawal charges andor recapture charges contract enhancements and any gains or losses attributable to a contract enhancement will be considered earnings under the contract for tax purposes  the contracts have a “freelook” period of twenty days after the owner receives the contract contract value less the full amount of any contract enhancements is returned upon exercise of free look rights by an owner therefore  of the contract enhancement will be recaptured under all circumstances if an owner returns the contract during the freelook period but any gain or loss on investments of the contract enhancement would be retained by the owner the dollar amount recaptured will never exceed the dollar amount of the contract enhancement added to the contract a withdrawal charge will not be assessed upon exercise of free look rights  in addition to the contract enhancement recapture charges the contracts may have additional charges including a withdrawal charge that applies to total withdrawals and partial withdrawals in excess of amounts permitted to be withdrawn under the contracts free withdrawal provision the withdrawal charges shown in the table below apply to the contracts the amount of the withdrawal charge depends upon the when the charge is imposed based on the completed years since the receipt of the related premium as followsstart printed page  withdrawal charge as a percentage of premium paymentscompleted years since receipt of premiumwithdrawal charge  jnl new york does not assess the withdrawal charge on any payments paid out as death benefits income payments the income date which is the date income payments commence cannot be sooner than  months from the issue date cancellation of the contract upon exercise of free look rights by an owner withdrawals of earnings withdrawals taken under the free withdrawal provision which allows for free withdrawals up to  of remaining premium less earnings and withdrawals necessary to satisfy the required minimum distribution of the internal revenue code if the withdrawal requested exceeds the required minimum distribution the withdrawal charge will not be waived on the required minimum distribution applicants legal analysis  applicants state that section c of the act authorizes the commission to exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from the provisions of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants request that the commission pursuant to section c of the act grant the exemptions requested below with respect to the contracts and any future contracts funded by the jnlny separate account or other accounts that are issued by jnl new york and underwritten or distributed by the distributor or affiliated brokerdealers applicants undertake that future contracts funded by the jnlny separate account or other accounts in the future will be substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  section  of the act regulates and imposes certain restrictions on the sales of periodic payment plan certificates issued by any registered investment company applicants state that subsection i of section  of the act provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account except as provided in paragraph  of the subsection paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless such contract is a redeemable security section a defines “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  applicants submit that the recapture of the contract enhancement in the circumstances set forth in its application would not deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets a contract owners interest in the amount of the contract enhancement allocated to his or her contract value upon receipt of a premium payment is not fully vested until nine complete years following a premium payment until or unless the amount of any contract enhancement is vested jnl new york retains the right and interest in the contract enhancement amount although not in the earnings attributable to that amount thus applicants urge that when jnl new york recaptures any contract enhancement it is simply retrieving its own assets and because a contract owners interest in the contract enhancement is not vested the contract owner has not been deprived of a proportionate share of the jnlny separate accounts assets ie a share of the jnlny separate accounts assets proportionate to the contract owners contract value  in addition applicants represent that it would be patently unfair to allow a contract owner exercising the freelook privilege to retain the contract enhancement amount under a contract that has been returned for a refund after a period of only a few days if jnl new york could not recapture the contract enhancement individuals could purchase a contract with no intention of retaining it and simply return it for a quick profit furthermore applicants state that the recapture of the contract enhancement relating to withdrawals and to income payments within the first nine years of a premium contribution is designed to protect jnl new york against contract owners not holding the contract for a sufficient time period it provides jnl new york with sufficient time to recover the cost of the contract enhancement and to avoid the financial detriment that would result from a shorter recapture period  applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the contract enhancement amount in the jnlny separate account after the contract enhancements is applied accordingly the assetbased charges applicable to the jnlny separate account will be assessed against the entire amounts held in the jnlny separate account including any contract enhancement amounts as a result the aggregate assetbased charges assessed will be higher than those that would be charged if the contract owners contract value did not include any contract enhancement  applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of any contract enhancement under the contracts do not violate sections a and ia of the act sections e and i were added to the act to implement the purposes of the national securities markets improvement act of  and congressional intent the application of a contract enhancement to premium payments made under the contracts should not raise any questions as to compliance by jnl new york with the provisions of section i however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants request an order providing exemption from sections a and ia to the extent deemed necessary to permit the recapture of the contract enhancements under the circumstances described herein and in the application without the loss of relief from section  provided by section i  applicants state that section c of the act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to start printed page principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section a rule c under the act prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  applicants state that it is possible that someone might view jnl new yorks recapture of the contract enhancements as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the jnlny separate account applicants contend however that the recapture of the contract enhancement does not violate rule c the recapture of some or all of the contract enhancement does not involve either of the evils that section c and rule c were intended to eliminate or reduce as far as reasonably practicable namely i the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or repurchase at a price above it and ii other unfair results including speculative trading practices to effect a recapture of a contract enhancement jnl new york will redeem interests in a contract owners contract value at a price determined on the basis of the current net asset value of the jnlny separate account the amount recaptured will be less than or equal to the amount of the contract enhancement that jnl new york paid out of its general account assets although contract owners will be entitled to retain any investment gains attributable to the contract enhancement and to bear any investment losses attributable to the contract enhancement the amount of such gains or losses will be determined on the basis of the current net asset values of the jnlny separate account thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the contract enhancement applicants also submit that the second harm that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the contract enhancement because neither of the harms that rule c was meant to address is found in the recapture of the contract enhancement rule c should not apply to any contract enhancement however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with rule c applicants request an order granting an exemption from the provisions of rule c to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the contract enhancement under the contracts  applicants submit that extending the requested relief to encompass future contracts and other accounts is appropriate in the public interest because it promotes competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications prior to introducing new variable annuity contracts investors would receive no benefit or additional protection by requiring applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issues under the act not already addressed in the application  applicants submit for the reasons stated herein that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the act namely that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and that therefore the commission should grant the requested order start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority elizabeth m murphy secretary end signature end supplemental

the recapture of the contract enhancement relating to withdrawals or receiving income payments within the first five or seven years of a premium contribution is designed to protect the insurance companies against amended contract owners not holding the amended contract for a sufficient time period according to applicants it would provide the insurance companies with insufficient time to recover the cost of the contract enhancement to its financial detriment  applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the contract enhancement amount in the separate accounts after the contract enhancements is applied accordingly the assetbased charges applicable to the separate accounts will be assessed against the entire amounts held in the separate accounts including any contract enhancement amounts as a result the aggregate assetbased charges assessed will be higher than those that would be charged if the amended contract owners contract value did not include any contract enhancement the insurance companies nonetheless represent that the amended contracts fees and charges in the aggregate are reasonable in relation to service rendered the expenses expected to be incurred and the risks assumed by the insurance companies  applicants represent that the contract enhancement will be attractive to and in the interest of investors because it will permit owners to put   or  of their firstyear premium payments to work for them in the investment divisions and the guaranteed accounts in addition the owner will retain any earnings attributable to the contract enhancements recaptured as well as the principal of the contract enhancement amount once vested  applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of any contract enhancement under the amended contracts do not violate sections a and ia of the act applicants assert that the application of a contract enhancement to premium payments made under the amended contracts should not raise any questions as to compliance by the insurance companies with the provisions of section i however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants request an exemption from section a and ia to the extent deemed necessary to permit the recapture of any contract enhancement under the circumstances described in the application without the loss of relief from section  provided by section i  section c of the act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered page  investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section a rule c under the act prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  it is possible that someone might view the insurance companies recapture of the contract enhancements as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the separate accounts applicants contend however that the recapture of the contract enhancement does not violate rule c the recapture of some or all of the contract enhancement does not involve either of the evils that rule c was intended to eliminate or reduce as far as reasonably practicable namely i the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or repurchase at a price above it and ii other unfair results including speculative trading practices to effect a recapture of a contract enhancement the insurance companies will redeem interests in an amended contract owners contract value at a price determined on the basis of the current net asset value of the separate accounts the amount recaptured will be less than or equal to the amount of the contract enhancement that the insurance companies paid out of their general account assets although amended contract owners will be entitled to retain any investment gains attributable to the contract enhancement and to bear any investment losses attributable to the contract enhancement the amount of such gains or losses will be determined on the basis of the current net asset values of the separate accounts thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the contract enhancement applicants also submit that the second harm that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the contract enhancement applicants assert that because neither of the harms that rule c was meant to address is found in the recapture of the contract enhancement rule c should not apply to any contract enhancement however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with rule c  applicants request an exemption from the provisions of rule c to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the contract enhancement under the amended contracts  applicants submit that extending the requested relief to encompass future contracts and other accounts is appropriate in the public interest because it promotes competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications prior to introducing new variable annuity contracts investors would receive no benefit or additional protection by requiring applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issues under the act not already addressed in the application applicants further submit for the reasons stated herein that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the act namely that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and that
