retail putnam absolute return  fund that they could incorporate into their annuity and life insurance platforms said putnams president and chief executive officer robert l reynolds this subaccount aims for targeted return with managed volatility that insurers can use in assembling portfolios to help meet their variable products investment risk and volatility objectivesthis new application is fresh evidence of the great potential that absolute return strategies have to meet a wide variety of investment goals reynolds explainedthe trustees of the putnam funds have approved the proposed subaccount and putnam has filed the subaccount with the us securities and exchange commission subject to the required review the putnam vt absolute return  fund will be launched in spring the putnam

tactics that employ security selection tactical asset allocation  currency transactions and options transactionsabsolute return strategies in general can help address a variety of retirementrelated investment concerns including market volatility the need for more dependable streams of income the potential for inflation and longevity risk said reynolds this makes such strategies especially
