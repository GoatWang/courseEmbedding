systems related products insight vision systems easy to use industrialgrade smart cameras with advanced machine vision technology in thailand the consumer products market continues to remain solid due primarily to a high level of government support and strong exports  in order to leverage this market most effectively global manufacturing companies need to find new ways to increase productivity and lower production costs while still delivering the highest quality consumer goodsusbased johnson  johnson is one of the world’s largest producers of fast moving consumer goods fmcg such as baby care products consumer health care products modess and carefree beauty care products clean  clear and neutrogena and many others  in addition to china and india johnson  johnson chose thailand to be a regional manufacturing hub the company’s factory is located in the lad krabang industrial estate zone and employs more than  peoplejohnson  johnson has an impeccable reputation for quality assurance qa because it has put the strictest standard of quality control in at every stage of production process the company has made significant investments in technology and factory management systems production process management work safety and health standards environmental impact analysis and socially responsible activities migration from sensor technology to vision sensor system and applications prior to adopting a vision system in the production line the company used an existing sensor system to check the completeness of material layers and other components of sanitary napkin products  however when additional product features are incorporated into new product designs the existing sensor system cannot read the new release paper pattern and color properly  the existing sensor system triggers the shut down signal which caused the machine to stop every time the operation staff needed to adjust the sensor position it resulted in significant production downtime and unnecessary waste in order to overcome this problem johnson  johnson decided to upgrade their existing sensor system to a vision system that uses image capture technology the goal with changing technologies was to reduce expenses associated with an incomplete production process and increase the production efficiency and effectiveness of the factory  more importantly johnson  johnson deployed a vision system to maintain the standards of every product the company makes  according to johnson  johnson’s company slogan “we never pass defect to customers”servo dynamics company limited a cognex automation solution provider asp in thailand provides advice assistance and the best vision system solution for companies both before and after installation  prior to installation servo dynamics recommended that johnson  johnson conduct a feasibility study and evaluate several vision systems products including cognex the study provided a comparison of the detailed attributes of each vision system in terms of efficiency functions and features valuation speed communication options with factory network and other backend systems and price  the cognex vision system was tested and approved by the working team because it completely met johnson  johnson’s requirements in terms of features reading rate speed and ease of setting up the software application cognex was the only company that offered a complete line of machine vision products that support different requirements in each production line  in the end the main differentiator for johnson  johnson was the fact that cognex has invested heavily in its research and development of machine vision technologyjohnson  johnson selected several cognex products to meet its vision system needs on the production lines includinginsight® micro  which is used for inspecting finished products  in order to ensure that every piece of product meets the high johnson  johnson standard the insight micro  provided the final inspection check prior to the product being packaged for shipping insight  which is used to capture the inner and outer rim of sanitary napkin to check if the materials in each layer are complete and there are not any missing layerschecker®  which is used for vision capture of the glue strip and is the tool that replaced the original sensor system insight  which is used to read the barcode on the talcum powder can on the production line systems integration great teamwork speeds up the processthe engineering team of johnson  johnson worked in conjunction with the experts from servo dynamics to study and plan the implementation and integration of the vision system into the factory system at the beginning addressing the inconsistent value caused by light from the led screen in various positions was a significant barrier to successful installation the servo dynamics team solved this problem by programming the insight explorer software to put an adjustment on the installation position and the alignment of light and color value through the control body of the programmable logic controller plc and ensuring this functionality can be easily applied and conveniently configured  the installation of the vision systems took only two months to complete  to date cognex vision systems are installed in eight modess sanitary napkin production lines and one production line of care free sanitary napkins vision systems are also being installed in all four production lines of baby talcum powder instant benefits gained right after the new vision system is operationaljohnson  johnson has been successful in solving the problem of sensor error reducing the production downtime rate to  and reducing waste from machine ramp up  in the first year alone the cost savings from preventing machine shutdown and reducing waste was valued at usd 7“in the past we had to use many quality assurance officers in random inspections of products at  minute intervals including the operation officers who had to align the sensor system or electrical system manually  with cognex vision systems in place these jobs are easy and convenient as they only need to control the value alignment and make any adjustment right from the monitor screen” stated mr jenwich mitravijarn engineer leader of johnson  johnson          “moreover we experienced that cognex vision systems are easy to set up and configure even for a first time user  as our business requirements keep changing over time the variety of cognex products cater to those changes and truly meet our specific needs well  another significant factor is cognex’s before and after sale service cognex provides prompt support and expertise that helps us find the best solutions at each stage this really gives us more confidence to invest in the future”looking ahead johnson  johnson is considering extending the installation of vision systems in the production lines of other products to cope with the higher market demand
