actelion pharmaceuticals  rd investment and returns  actelion ltd adr otcmktsalioy  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»actelion pharmaceuticals  rd investment and returnsjul   about actelion ltd alioy saurabh mishra value research analyst biotech healthcarefarmantrasummarythe accounting treatment of rd expenses skews the actual return on capital of the companythe return on capital of actelion drops to almost half when rd is capitalizedgiven the poor rd efficiency of pharmaceuticals these days the return on capital drops for most of the companiesthe companies who manage rd efficiently will have higher return on capital when capitalizedit is true that accounting is inconsistent in dealing with capital expenditures and operating expenditures of manufacturing firms vs technology or rd based firms the operating expenditures are designed to generate benefits in the current year whereas capital expenditures are designed to generate benefits in the future the us gaap does not allow the rd to be capitalized whereas in ifrs a certain portion of development cost can be capitalized provided there is a certainty in future benefits hence we decided to take actelion pharmaceuticals otcpkalioy otcpkaliof as an example to understand the impact on its return on capital when it capitalizes its rd vs when it does not the idea of this exercise is that as a risk averse investor one would prefer investing in a company with better rd productivity ie better return on capital on its rd investment actelion pharmaceuticals actelion ltd is a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of innovative drugs for diseases with unmet medical needs actelion is a leader in the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah their portfolio of pah treatments covers the spectrum of disease from who functional class fc ii through to fc iv with oral inhaled and intravenous medications although not available in all countries actelion has treatments approved by health authorities for a number of specialist diseases including type  gaucher disease niemannpick type c disease digital ulcers in patients suffering from systemic sclerosis and mycosis fungoides type cutaneous tcell lymphoma actelions stock price movements actelions stock price jumped from  chf in july  to  today st of july  comparing with the sp  and morningstar midcap companies actelion seems to be ahead in the game source morningstar the rd investment and returns before we capitalize actelions rd investment let us first understand the reasons why accounting does not permit capitalizing rd benefits are uncertain it is true that rd is uncertain but so is an investment in a manufacturing plant in countries torn with civil war even some of the giant companies such as hp nysehpq have tried to build tablets which were unsuccessful in the market but those expenses of manufacturing were capitalized accounting was developed way back when manufacturing was one of the key businesses since then the business models have changed  we have businesses such as uber airbnb consumer product companies such as cocacola nyseko and biotech companies that might not own a big chunk of tangible assets but in order to generate longterm returns they do lot of investments in rd training and advertisements hence those expenses or a portion of those expenses that would generate returns in long term need to be capitalized being conservative one of the arguments is that by expensing the rd the earnings are conservative however by expensing we are depriving the biggest asset from the books of biotech companies ie their rd that also implies that the return on capital for those companies spending huge amounts on intangible assets will look inflated impact of rd investments on return on capital actelion spent  m chf on rd in  in order to capitalize it is important to first define the amortizable life of rd ie how much time it takes actelion to launch the product from its rd lab to the market given the strategy to develop its own products as well as inlicense at very late stages an average of five years was assumed contrary to typical product development time of  years after collecting the fiveyear rd expenses from  the unamortized rd over the period was sum up the unamortized rd is the value of the research asset and will be added separately during the calculation of book value of capital the value of the research assetunamortized value of the rd   m chf total amortization of rd asset for    m chf the rd expenditure for  ie  m chf is not amortized assuming that it is invested just yesterday all the earnings in chf millions the return on capital without capitalizing  looks very attractive in comparison to  after capitalizing this is because the book value of capital of  m chf does not include the value of the intangible asset ie rd investment done in the past competitive analysis in order to understand how actelions competition fare in terms of their rd investments and returns we decided to check the return on capital roc of the competition united therapeutics nasdaquthr bayer otcpkbayry and pfizer nysepfe if the roc increases after capitalization thats a rough indicator that the investment on rd generates greater return than the investment on traditional assets the following table gives the roc expensing as well as capitalizing of the competition it seems that capitalizing rd has the maximum impact on actelion although the profitability ratio seems very high but capitalizing pulls down the actual roc capitalizing rd provides an answer to the question is rd investment good for the company of course it is provided it helps you to make excess returns in the future actelion does make excess returns ie its return on capital is higher than the cost of capital however our view about how much excess returns it has actually made is different when we capitalize the rd investments ie investments that are meant to generate returns in the multiple periods consequences for valuation when we capitalize the rd we are changing several financial statements we evaluate its impact on the following parameters important for valuation operating income the operating income changes by adding back the rd expense and subtracting the amortization of rd free cash flow to the firm fcff it remains the same as earnings and reinvestment change by the same amount growth rate the fundamental expected growth rate depends on how much the company reinvests in the form of capital expenditures and change in noncash working capital and how well it reinvests which is measured by the return on capital if the operating income as well as the reinvestment increases the reinvestment rate would increase if the roc is greater after capitalizing rd it can be assumed that returns on rd investment is greater than the returns on traditional investments hence the growth rate will increase or decrease depending on whether reinvestment rate and the return on capital increasesdecreases does actelions intrinsic value decrease or increase after capitalization we will see its impact in detail in our next post on actelion in sum we see that the accounting treatment of capex at the manufacturing firm is different from that of technology based firms such as biotech and pharmaceutical companies who invest a huge sum of money on rd to generate returns in the future expensing rd provides a skewed view of the returns they are making on their investments and also has an impact on the value the companies who manage rd efficiently will have higher return on capital when capitalized assumptions return on capital the book value of capital used is based on  while the after tax operating income is from  the argument is that in the real world there is always a lag between the capital invested and the returns the company generates tax rate actelion received tax benefits in the year  however we used the marginal tax rate of  kpmg data for switzerland with the assumption that it cannot earn the benefit throughout its life for others effective tax rates are used capex includes ppe cost of acquisition and rd rd amortization period for actelion a fiveyear period is chosen as the company not only develops its own products at early stages but also licenses it at a very late stage to launch the products hence on an average we used a fiveyear period for the amortization all data collected from the annual reports from the respective companies disclaimer farmantra or its employee and author saurabh mishra does not hold any shares in

actelion ltd alioy christopher fisher special situations eventdriven arbitragesummaryjnj has completed the acquisition of actelionan unsponsored actelion adr trades otc in the usadr shares could be subject to a  withholding tax with little recourseon friday johnson  johnson jnj completed their acquisition of swiss pharmaceutical company actelion in a b deal actelion shareholders received usdshare  a share in a new rd company called idorsia jj paid in usd for a few reasons for one as bloomberg estimated over half of the shareholders were actually us based actelion traded on a few different exchanges with most volume being traded on the swiss six exchange for anyone planning to buy the shares as a merger arb trade this complicated things as you would have to pay for the shares in swiss francs chf and then hedge the currency exposure one alternative to this would have been to purchase the us listed adr which trades otc as otcpkalioy this is an unsponsored adr meaning it isnt associated with actelion citi drs nysec the adr sponsor simply purchased shares of actelion is switzerland and listed the adr shares in the us of note is that alioy represents ¼ share of actelion so the payment price from jj was us  this was an excellent trade suggested by one seeking alpha author here a situation that has been common in a few recent foreign mergers is that there are tax uncertainties depending on the proportion of shares tendered and whether a holder has tendered their shares actelion made it easy to avoid issues of the shares trading past the tender deadline by listing a tendered line of shares under the ticker atlnee traders could buy this line right up until fridays close and not worry about having missed the tender deadline the issue with not tendering is that if between  of shares are tendered holders of shares that arent tendered may be subject to swiss withholding tax to the tune of  from the offer document the consideration paid to remaining actelion minority shareholders irrespective of their tax residence in the squeezeout merger may depending on the structuring of the squeezeout merger be subject to swiss withholding tax of  on the difference between nysei the amount of the consideration and ii the sum of the nominal value of the actelion shares concerned and of the proportionate part of actelions reserves from capital contributions reserven aus kapitaleinlagen attributable to the respective actelion shares actelion shareholders who are not tax residents of switzerland may be entitled to a full or partial refund of the swiss withholding tax if the country of residence for tax purposes has entered into a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with switzerland and the conditions of such treaty are met by my calculations the book value per share is roughly chfshare meaning withholding tax could be applied on the remaining chf  being paid to actelion shareholders at  that would be about chfshare in withholding tax or net proceeds of share of alioy there was a similar situation with chemchinas tender offer for syngenta nysesyt which was also domiciled in switzerland there is an excellent write up on the tax issues associated with the syngenta closing here comment section has some good info as well let me outline the key points syngenta based in switzerland trades as synn in switzerland and also as a sponsored ie issued by the company adr in the us as  syt shares represent  synn share us options are available on this ticker merger consideration paid by chemchina was usd per share or usd per synn share faces possible  withholding tax if percentage of shares tendered is less than   applicable to foreign holders who did not tender us holders may be able to have this tax reduced to  syt was a company issued adr therefore swiss holders could step in and purchase untendered shares and not be subject to the withholding tax there was a certain amount of uncertainty with how options could be treated it was possible that the occ could step in and mark the options suspend trading and cash settle all outstanding options if shares traded down substantially to reflect the possible withholding tax put sellers could have been in for a nasty surprise what happened on may th syngenta announced provisional tender results indicating  of shares had been tendered when it appeared that there would be no extension of the tender offer and shares remaining untendered could be subject to withholding tax shares began trading down closing at  on may th from the closing price of  may th put option prices started increasing dramatically with most trades occurring on the bid chemchina and syngenta put an end to speculation however with a press release on may st stating that they had acquired close to  of syngenta shares and would continue buying shares in the market with the aim of reaching the  threshold while shares remain listed and trading and its possible they could still be hit with withholding tax it now seems likely chemchina will simply continue buying shares until they hit  syt data by ycharts so now back to actelion and its unsponsored adr the issue of withholding tax was of obvious concern for alioy shareholders who made clear the risks to the adrs issuer citi for whatever reason citi decided not to tender the shares which i confirmed with a citi representative because of the share structure there is also no way for swiss parties to buy shares and avoid withholding tax actelions last announcement on the tender stated the definitive end to the tender with  of shares being submitted they later announced the completion of the acquisition after clearing by the eu commission with settlement on june th actelion stated that immediately after the completion of the tender offer they would file to delist shares from the swiss six exchange and jj would conduct a squeeze out of remaining shares thereafter atln shares are still trading alioy data by ycharts so if you are holding shares of alioy should you sell now citi confirmed they planned to sell the idorsia shares they received in the market which could mean proceeds of between usd  depending on when they sold shares could be paid out between usd  and  vs the current price of  if no withholding tax is applied if withholding tax is applied consideration paid to holders could be closer to  there also seems to be little holders of alioy could do to reclaim these taxes given the adr structure so should you sell now i certainly wouldnt want to hold these shares given the
