performing new gadgets but at the end of the day that hp car spends most of its time in the garage our quadcore processor idles while we struggle with ms word and the additional harddisk space that we bought just to be on the safe side will remain empty forever even large parts of our brain lie waste while we check another  cat pictures on reddit a lot of altcoin projects aim to give purpose to all those unused resources allowing end users to make a little money off their spare processing power car mileage personal information or even to farm their awwinebriated minds for money like in the case of steemit in the second installment of our series about altcoins we present another project that goes for our unused hard disk space storj got us pretty excited by how far ahead it already is but most of all by the way in which its developers try to strike a balance between perfect decentralization and overall usefulness the technology like sia which we reviewed in the first installment storj offers decentralized endtoend encrypted cloud storage the core protocol allows for peer to peer negotiation and verification of storage contracts providers of storage are called farmers and those using the storage renters renters periodically audit whether the farmers are still keeping their files safe and in a clever twist of similar architectures immediately pay out a small amount of cryptocurrency for each successful audit conversely farmers can decide to stop storing a file if its owner does not audit and pay their services on time files are cut up into pieces called shards and stored  times redundantly by default the network will automatically determine a new farmer and move data if copies become unavailable in the core protocol contracts are negotiated through a completely decentralized keyvalue store kademlia the system puts measures in place that prevent farmers and renters from cheating on each other eg through manipulation of the auditing process other measures are taken to prevent attacks on the protocol itself storj like other similar services offers several advantages over more traditional cloud storage solutions since data is encrypted and cut into shards at source there is almost no conceivable way for unauthorized third parties to access that data data storage is naturally distributed and this in turn increases availability and download speed thanks to the use of multiple parallel connections on top of the core protocol the storj developers have built a suite of tools that walks the line between complete decentralization and usefulness we like this approach because we believe that fully decentralized so to say maximalist blockchain plays lack the usability necessary for mainstream adoption accessible to any end user is storj share the client that allows farming free hard disk space on windows macos or linux  a few clicks and you are a farmer more on this in our usability review below the storj bridge centralizes and simplifies access to the network handling contract negotiation auditing payment and availability in a way it can be compared to the skype supernodes of yore the storj client accesses the bridge and the api it provides to store the actual data in the network account management and client pairing can be handled through the client or through a small central webapp this architecture eliminates the need for each and every client to become an integral part of the network and greatly increases the systems immediate usefulness for developers without sacrificing too much of the advantages that stem from its decentralization the economy while the storj protocol could work with any kind of currency even if economics permit a noncrypto asset the storj tools rely on storjcoin x sjcx for the payment of storage space sjcx is a counterparty asset counterparty in turn relies on bitcoins blockchain for its transactions there is a fixed total of  sjcx  were available at the time of writing the initial distribution of sjcx happened via a crowdsale that raised about  btc at a rate of  sjcx per btc the crowdsale was preceded by a precrowdsale that sold about m sjcx from  to  storj labs inc used approximately m sjcx per year almost all of which have gone to fund community volunteers and pay farmers in the test groups storj labs inc is working on a transparency plan for sjcx and told us that they will commit to a m sjcx cap per year on the amount of coins that can be used from the larger balance of funds that include the community pool developer pool and bitcoin pool detailed in the crowdsale terms like with other storage plays money will primarily be entering the ecosystem through the purchase of storage space storj is quite far ahead and plans to enter the commercial market somewhen later in  consequently we had to look quite far ahead too when searching for potential pitfalls in storjs economic model if storj intends to primarily compete on price there is a certain risk that beyond the initial enthusiasm few rational actors will remain committed to farming out their unused harddisk space neglecting traffic revenues but also any profit for the renter a theoretical max income for a  farmer could be onethird of amazons s prices in this setting  a negligible amount of money about gbmonth at the time of writing the classical argument against this is that storage space and bandwidth are sunk costs anyway but after decades of environmental education we believe that things will not work out like this for many people the perceived cost of leaving their desktop or laptop running  is probably higher than the real cost and farming only when the computer needs to be on anyway doesnt feel quite right from this point of view we hope that storj will be able to take full advantage of the actual benefits it has to offer compared to classical storage services privacy reliability and speed the ideal storjbased consumer offering would be some kind of highly private dropbox that is able to charge a premium compared to the convenient but insecurebydesign usbased companys product for the renting side storj will mostly appeal to bigtime storage guzzlers or to those who have a very high interest in privacy or global network resilience for all but the biggest players storage comes for almost free with the services that they are already using and they would probably rather consider farming their existing storage than buying new one we hope that storj will be adopted and loved by developers for the unique properties it has to offer and not just be considered a cheap alternative to s and the likes the company behind storj storj labs inc relies on a combination of crowdfunding and conventional venture capital so far the company has raised a m seed round in februarymarch  developers and community storj labs inc has been able to attract a talented bunch of people and is looking for more the storj founders left to right tome boshevski chief design officer james prestwich coo  cfo john quinn chief development officer and shawn wilkinson ceo  cto the storj team structure too reflects the companys determination to strike a balance between technological prowess and realworld usefulness among others it encompasses developers business people and advisors but also ux specialists and community workers the community around the project seems to be picking up too with an encouraging number of outside contributions on github and the user forums the storj team reached out to us after we published the sia review here on steemit little did they know that we had already become smalltime farmers on their system a few days ago they provided us with additional technological background info and important clarifications regarding the upcoming transparency plan for sjcx enduser experience farming storjs farming solution storj share is exceedingly simple to use download the client install define the storage location and your payment address and youre good to go we loved farming with storj share so much we have peers we make contracts all the time that in the beginning we didnt even think about the fact that we were actually providing resources to somebody else during the ongoing test phase rewards are paid out in bulk via a script run by the storj developers of course a reward model that almost immediately shows albeit small payouts will add to the gamification of the system storj share ran just fine and out of the box on our typical home networks at work upnp is disabled and we had to manually set up the correct firewall rules storj share behaved nicely on the systems we used to test on the home network the additional strain on the wifi connection became noticeable for example when streaming music over the same network our gigabit network at work didnt even notice the additional traffic things got a bit more complicated when we tried to build a farming rig based on ubuntu lts both the gui and the command line clients refused to handle the four drives that we installed gracefully after combining the drives into a raid  and renting them out as one everything went back to normal all in all an impressive farming experience for such an early stage product renting renting is free while the current testing phase called test group c lasts farmers are paid through the storj project renting doesnt come with an easy to use gui client it is very obviously targeting developers for those however quick starting by up and downloading a few cat pictures is made easy thanks to a comprehensive documentation we experienced impressive throughput rates both up and downloading files on various kinds of networks there were a few hiccups for example when trying to store an entire hd episode of game of thrones which we of course didnt share with anybody else we experienced occasional hangups during up and downloading overall the renting experience seemed stable enough to start building a beta product based on storj right now for fun and profit besides speculating on the value of sjcx is there a way to make money off storj right here right now well its difficult to tell since payouts based on the actual provision of storage space are not happening yet current payouts are rewarding test group participants according to a formula developed and made transparent by the storj team out of parts that we had lying around at the office we decided to build a small storage rig that is able to farm about one tb a profitable rig would probably have to be bigger since unlike gpu or asic farms its possible to build extremely power efficient and cheap storage rigs try a raspberry pi with some used gb disks off ebay its not completely unimaginable that such a system could work profitably on storj especially if the bandwidth it uses can be considered sunk cost our rig seems to consume about w currently and to use a negligible amount of our flat rate gigabit internet connection since we got the parts for free wed have to only make about   per year for the rig to be profitable under our conditions meaning with the high electricity costs here in zurich switzerland anybody up for a solar powered low energy storage farm on his rooftop conclusion as you can probably tell if you got that far we are pretty excited about storj and about how far ahead the project already is compared to other blockchainenabled storage plays in spite of all the excitement we must not forget that the basic premise of such projects needs to be proven that theres a need for truly decentralized endtoend encrypted storage solutions that are farming excess storage space that there is indeed a need for that is the kneejerk reaction of almost anybody working with the internet for as long as we are but we must not ignore that massmarket adoption of privacyfocused technologies has been slow at best we see storj as an invitation to create completely new kinds of services in this domain and hope that a lot of developers with a vision will jump on the opportunity we plan to continue this series and to eventually review most of the current crypto projects from a fundamentals perspective tell us what

test groups since the start of the year and have gotten about  sjcx in testing rewards so far for contributing  tb of capacity of course this is in no way indicative of actual income after commercial launch storj inspired me to buy a low end synology nas which has been great for archiving backups of my desktop system and being a storj farmer  it was a bit complicated to setup farming on the nas and required a bit of trial and error but in the end i got it working with support from the fairly active storj slack community these days it pretty much runs on auto pilot but i still log onto the nas and check logs every couple days to make sure things are going smoothly and occasionally i have to upgrade the software when new versions get released overall being a storj farmer has been an educational experience and a fun little hobby getting involved has expanded my personal horizons and taught me new tech skills so even if farming doesnt become very profitable its still worth it for me i wish the storj team much success with future phases of the project its off to a good start and i look forward to a solid level of adoption after commercial launch votes solar kingnuze iainc
