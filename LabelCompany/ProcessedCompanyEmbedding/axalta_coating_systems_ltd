automobile which we are accustomed to seeing everywhere of these processes coating is effective for protecting the surface of an automobile body and making the automobile body look beautiful a coating film formed by coating is usually consists of three to five layers coating processes removing iron powders and oils adhering to materials such as steel plate enhances adhesion to electrodeposition coatings it also forms a chemical coating film and increases the resistance to corrosion using chemical reactions automobile bodies are dipped in a large vessel containing electrodeposition coatings for preventing rust and coated by applying electrical current this makes it possible to coat the inside of the automobile body which is difficult to coat by spraycoating this is done by making the automobile body look beautiful and reducing the damage due to chipping in the top coating the final coating process after having undercoated for coloring a clear coat is coated to make the surface glossy and improve weatherproofing return to the top of the page coatings for parts electrodeposition coatings for parts and frames metal parts which are heavily used in automobiles require high
