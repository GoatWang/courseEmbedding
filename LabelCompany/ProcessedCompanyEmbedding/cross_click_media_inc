february   as southern products inc and was doing business as sigmac usa on august   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of cosignercom inc a private nevada corporation “cosignercom” as a result of the acquisition we divested our former consumer electronics business and began to focus on the business of cosignercom inc as our primary line of business   on august   the company completed its merger with cosignercom and its whollyowned subsidiary cosigner acquisition corp under the merger agreement the company merged with and into cosigner acquisition corp in connection with the closing of this transaction cosigner inc acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the company which resulted in the company becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of cosigner inc in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the company’s stock the shareholders received a total of  shares of the newlydesignated series a convertible preferred stock  in newlyissued  secured notes warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock an exercise price of  per share and  newlyissued shares of common stock   the closing of the transaction has been characterized as a reverse capitalization therefore the historical financial statements are the financial statements of cosignercom inc which have been presented to retroactively reflect the historic capitalization of the accounting acquiree   on june   the company changed its name to crossclick media inc from cosigner inc with the full consent of the board of directors and filed such with the nevada secretary of state’s office subsequently finra approved the name and stock symbol change with an effective date of july  the company transitioned from a real estate financial services holding company to a marketing and new media company featuring an affiliate network call center and an enterprise solutions division that can provide design web development ecommerce data management and more

innovative marketing to help brand their corporate identity products and services within the first six months of operations since the transition in business model we have generated revenue from our new line of business and have several clients already receiving services on a daily or weekly basis        crossclick media inc has developed a multichannel marketing program known as the ad wheel businesses can readily target their selected audience using socio and economic demographics to deliver their marketing or branding message “call to action” campaign or deliver an “act now” coupon or opportunity supported by our call center and online development departments to present a cohesive presentation and deliver results this concept began to be developed in support the company’s subsidiary cosignercom   cosignercom provided creditchallenged tenants with a cosigner while providing residential landlords a contracted rent payment guarantee for a specified number of months within the  month lease period for their specified properties one lease at a time this lease payment assurance program was flexible with defaulted rent paid for either a month or month period of time within the month contract period depending upon the requirement or election of the landlord at this time cosignercom is busy restructuring its business model streamlining its processes and practices having learned many lessons over  surety contracts and processing to deliver a more vibrant menu of online based services we look forward to launching our revitalized web portal in the first quarter of    cosignercom was established as a result of the  financial and housing crises since the summer of  to today a large number of americans have lost their jobs their homes andor their businesses resulting in having their personal wealth and credit scores severely reduced and damaging their credit history over this same time period circumstances and events have occurred leaving more and more people unable to qualify for a residential lease a survey by the associated press july  states that  of all adult americans will experience near poverty or unemployment in their lifetime while a recent report by experian stated that america is becoming more of a renter nation out of choice and as such the need for residential cosigning of leases will only grow as a result of these circumstances the need to have someone cosign for a residential lease has increased in the case of many tenants the family and friends who would have cosigned for them a few years ago are now unable to do so   cosignercom seeks to meet the increased need for lease cosigners with the concept of commercializing residential rent guarantees cosigning as a professional financial service on a tenantfee paid basis our service replaces the traditional need to rely on family and friends to cosign on a lease with an affordable and professional service that benefits both tenant and landlord similar to the very same type of service that has been a mainstay in australia’s residential leasing industry for over the past twenty years this surety service product directly benefits the landlord and those responsible for the collection of residential rents while being paid for by an independent second party the tenant instead of looking for an individual to be their guarantor or cosigner or having to pay a significantly larger security deposit or prepaid rent a renter may qualify to purchase a lease guarantee from cosignercom to satisfy the landlords financial and credit requirements additional benefits are available to the paying tenant including a credit reporting option on the tenant’s rent payments during the contract period   over the past fortythree  months cosignercom has continued to develop refine and fieldtest its business model and rent guarantee programs in targeted markets across the united states cosignercom’s management believes that the company has a unique service ready to be distributed in the top twentyfive us rental markets in june  the company launched its test of an infield sales force in the southern michigan area the test results did not meet management’s expectations and the company is evaluating strategic opportunities for its future including sale of the asset to qualified thirdparty investors   cosignercom’s growth strategy is based on the expansion of its residential lease payment program and on bundling this program with tenant screening and residential placement services online the company’s goal is to make the use of commercial rent assurance the us industry standard and to focus its resources and market awareness efforts on landlords and property managers educating them on the simplicity and value of the company’s service that facilitates housing for tenants and maximizes occupancy rates and cash flow for landlords with almost  rental units in the united states and  out of every  adults having poor bad or no credit the
