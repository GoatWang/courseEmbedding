lawsuitsedit main article ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co united states supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg stated lilly ledbetter was a supervisor at goodyear tire and rubber’s plant in gadsden alabama from  until her retirement in  for most of those years she worked as an area manager a position largely occupied by men initially ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work over time however her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority by the end of  ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between ledbetter and her  male counterparts was stark ledbetter was paid  per month the lowest paid male area manager received  per month the highest paid  lilly ledbetter sued goodyear claiming she was paid less than men doing the same work she won the suit and was awarded  the jury deciding that goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination the case was appealed to the supreme court in ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co  us   justice alito held for the fivejustice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer  days ago or more the united states congress overturned this decision by passing the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of  which was the first bill signed into law by president obama this was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation the plaintiff in this case lilly ledbetter characterized her situation as one where disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period in rejecting ledbetters appeal the supreme court said that she could have and should have sued when the pay decisions were made instead of waiting beyond the day statutory charging period justice ginsburg dissented from the opinion of the court joined by justices stevens souter and breyer she argued against applying the day limit to pay discrimination because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time furthermore the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions such as termination adverse actions are obvious but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than  days of the pay change ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the courts cramped interpretation her dissent asserted that the employer had been knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward during the day charging period and therefore could be held liable environmental recordedit researchers at the university of massachusetts amherst identified goodyear as the thlargest corporate

aggression in vietnam in  the rubber workers union was communistrun so after the coup many of them were killed or imprisoned some of the survivors you see them here still work the rubber  but this time as prisoners and at gunpoint sexual discrimination lawsuitsedit main article ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co united states supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg stated lilly ledbetter was a supervisor at goodyear tire and rubber’s plant in gadsden alabama from  until her retirement in  for most of those years she worked as an area manager a position largely occupied by men initially ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work over time however her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority by the end of  ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between ledbetter and her  male counterparts was stark ledbetter was paid  per month the lowest paid male area manager received  per month the highest paid  lilly ledbetter sued goodyear claiming she was paid less than men doing the same work she won the suit and was awarded  the jury deciding that goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination the case was appealed to the supreme court in ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co  us   justice alito held for the fivejustice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer  days ago or more the united states congress overturned this decision by passing the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of  which was the first bill signed into law by president obama this was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation the plaintiff in this case lilly ledbetter characterized her situation as one where disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period in rejecting ledbetters appeal the supreme court said that she could have and should have sued when the pay decisions were made instead of waiting beyond the day statutory charging period justice ginsburg dissented from the opinion of the court joined by justices stevens souter and breyer she argued against applying the day limit to pay discrimination because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time furthermore the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions such as termination adverse actions are obvious but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than  days of the pay change ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the courts cramped interpretation her dissent asserted that the employer had been knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward during the day charging period and therefore could be held liable environmental recordedit researchers at the university of

lawsuitsedit main article ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co united states supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg stated lilly ledbetter was a supervisor at goodyear tire and rubber’s plant in gadsden alabama from  until her retirement in  for most of those years she worked as an area manager a position largely occupied by men initially ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work over time however her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority by the end of  ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between ledbetter and her  male counterparts was stark ledbetter was paid  per month the lowest paid male area manager received  per month the highest paid  lilly ledbetter sued goodyear claiming she was paid less than men doing the same work she won the suit and was awarded  the jury deciding that goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination the case was appealed to the supreme court in ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co  us   justice alito held for the fivejustice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer  days ago or more the united states congress overturned this decision by passing the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of  which was the first bill signed into law by president obama this was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation the plaintiff in this case lilly ledbetter characterized her situation as one where disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period in rejecting ledbetters appeal the supreme court said that she could have and should have sued when the pay decisions were made instead of waiting beyond the day statutory charging period justice ginsburg dissented from the opinion of the court joined by justices stevens souter and breyer she argued against applying the day limit to pay discrimination because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time furthermore the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions such as termination adverse actions are obvious but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than  days of the pay change ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the courts cramped interpretation her dissent asserted that the employer had been knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward during the day charging period and therefore could be held liable environmental recordedit researchers at the university of massachusetts amherst identified goodyear as the thlargest corporate

lawsuitsedit main article ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co united states supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg stated lilly ledbetter was a supervisor at goodyear tire and rubber’s plant in gadsden alabama from  until her retirement in  for most of those years she worked as an area manager a position largely occupied by men initially ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work over time however her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority by the end of  ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between ledbetter and her  male counterparts was stark ledbetter was paid  per month the lowest paid male area manager received  per month the highest paid  lilly ledbetter sued goodyear claiming she was paid less than men doing the same work she won the suit and was awarded  the jury deciding that goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination the case was appealed to the supreme court in ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co  us   justice alito held for the fivejustice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer  days ago or more the united states congress overturned this decision by passing the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of  which was the first bill signed into law by president obama this was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation the plaintiff in this case lilly ledbetter characterized her situation as one where disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period in rejecting ledbetters appeal the supreme court said that she could have and should have sued when the pay decisions were made instead of waiting beyond the day statutory charging period justice ginsburg dissented from the opinion of the court joined by justices stevens souter and breyer she argued against applying the day limit to pay discrimination because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time furthermore the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions such as termination adverse actions are obvious but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than  days of the pay change ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the courts cramped interpretation her dissent asserted that the employer had been knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward during the day charging period and therefore could be held liable environmental recordedit researchers at the university of massachusetts amherst identified goodyear as the thlargest corporate

lawsuitsedit main article ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co united states supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg stated lilly ledbetter was a supervisor at goodyear tire and rubber’s plant in gadsden alabama from  until her retirement in  for most of those years she worked as an area manager a position largely occupied by men initially ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work over time however her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority by the end of  ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between ledbetter and her  male counterparts was stark ledbetter was paid  per month the lowest paid male area manager received  per month the highest paid  lilly ledbetter sued goodyear claiming she was paid less than men doing the same work she won the suit and was awarded  the jury deciding that goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination the case was appealed to the supreme court in ledbetter v goodyear tire  rubber co  us   justice alito held for the fivejustice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer  days ago or more the united states congress overturned this decision by passing the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of  which was the first bill signed into law by president obama this was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation the plaintiff in this case lilly ledbetter characterized her situation as one where disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period in rejecting ledbetters appeal the supreme court said that she could have and should have sued when the pay decisions were made instead of waiting beyond the day statutory charging period justice ginsburg dissented from the opinion of the court joined by justices stevens souter and breyer she argued against applying the day limit to pay discrimination because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time furthermore the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions such as termination adverse actions are obvious but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than  days of the pay change ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the courts cramped interpretation her dissent asserted that the employer had been knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward during the day charging period and therefore could be held liable environmental recordedit researchers at the university of massachusetts amherst identified goodyear as the thlargest corporate
