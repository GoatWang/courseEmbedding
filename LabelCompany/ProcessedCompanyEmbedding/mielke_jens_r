blogs jens mielke revenue recognition lessons learned so far in my first blog on the topic of the new revenue recognition guidance i shared an overview of what asu  covers and some thoughts around how it will impact companies since then aventine hills technical accounting team has been engaged by clients to assist with their initial assessment and adoption process while still early some “lessons learned” can be shared to help others who are about to begin the process as the old advertising saying goes “your results may vary” so too may your experiences with revenue recognition every company is different and even companies in the same industry may have different outcomes it’s not too soon to start and waiting is risky when it was finally issued in  the adoption date for the standard  at the time  for public companies  seemed a long way off few companies even considered beginning an assessment then via an amendment to the standard we received a oneyear deferral even better…or so we thought suddenly a lot of other projects jumped ahead on our collective accounting department agenda now we are just over a year and a half from the required public company adoption date and based on my discussions with many executives a lot of companies haven’t even started an initial assessment one thing that i have learned from talking with client and nonclient executives who have begun an assessment is that the process is generally taking longer than originally expected there are several reasons for this internal project team members tend to be pulled off the project to deal with more “immediate” emergencies gathering and analyzing contracts can be more difficult and time consuming than expected system changes can be very labor intensive and it personnel may get pulled away as well there can be a tendency to “slow walk” adoption in hopes the due date will be deferred again it can be tempting to bet that more timing relief is on the way especially given the constant stream of amendments and interpretations that are published however we at aventine hill are seeing initial impact assessment projects take several months before the implementation process even begins waiting is looking like a risky bet and starting early allows you to gain insights into your business that you may want to change beyond just adopting the standard you may find some unexpected things in your customer contracts when we talk with companies that have begun the adoption process one startling fact often emerges – companies especially those that are highly decentralized often don’t know where their contracts are stored while some companies have implemented electronic storage for legal documents many have not this can mean that hard copies of contracts are filed away in cabinets all over the country or even overseas one of the early steps in adoption is identifying your contracts based on your revenue stream analysis i highly recommend establishing a policy of having a central repository and using this opportunity to put new policies in place once contracts are located it is quite common for accounting to find a few surprises in them usually these surprises are minor but there is always a risk that the actual terms in contracts are so different than what was previously assumed there could be an accounting difference one side benefit to the assessment and adoption process is that companies gain a fresh understanding of what’s in their contracts opportunities to improve contract terms for the future may be uncovered yes you will need to talk to it  stat the new standard is certainly accounting and reporting focused but in todays’ world we know nothing happens in accounting that doesn’t somehow go “through the system” the demands of the new standard will undoubtedly require some level of system reconfiguration this can span from minor tweaking to the installation of new modules or even new software altogether system changes require time any accountant that has spent a lot of their career working closely with it can tell you this time is usually measured in months not days or weeks large companies have publicly discussed how it will be the gating issue for a successful adoption process the same may apply to smaller companies my advice get it involved now if you do not have a large it department to help you analyze what changes are needed and prepare a project budget to commit resources aventine hills cio services can help get to know practical expedients the new guidance contains many practical expedients that can make postadoption life much easier  they offer companies the ability to set policies that can “expedite” the accounting for revenue an example would be freight and delivery expenses the guidance allows for companies to make an election treating these charges as incidental not performance obligations once this election is made freight would not have to be accounted for in the same manner as the product and this eases some of the accounting burden the collective use of practical expedients requires some research and work up front but it can save a lot of effort in the future if the accounting doesn’t kill you the disclosures might for some companies the changes to the accounting itself may not be material but even companies that don’t see big changes to their financial statements will see big changes to their footnotes and for many the newly required disclosures will be tough to produce for example quantitative disclosures by major product line disaggregating revenue as to whether it will recognized at a point in time v over time and future revenues to be recognized from existing contracts with unfulfilled performance obligations most companies we talk to are not set up to produce these disclosures and some amount of system reconfiguration will be necessary what should you do now its the same advice as in my previous blog develop an adoption timeline with reasonable milestones inventory customer contracts assess your it systems take an honest look at your internal and external resources and determine whether or not your team has the bandwidth to get it all done it’s likely it doesn’t we can
