the dubious promotion of herbalifes niteworks home search the skeptical guide to multilevel marketing send this page to a friend      the dubious promotion of herbalifes niteworks stephen barrett md herbalife would like you believe that taking niteworks™ will benefit your heart the product was formulated by louis j ignarro phd professor of molecular and medical pharmacology at the ucla school of medicine who shared the  nobel prize in medicine for his research concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system  this article tells why i believe that niteworks is being promoted with improper claims and ignarros conduct has been highly questionable ingredients and claims niteworks which has been marketed since  is a powdered mixture each dose of which contains  mg of vitamin c  international units of vitamin e  micrograms of folic acid  mg of lemon balm extract  mg of alpha lipoic acid  mg of ltaurine and  grams of a proprietary blend of larginine and lcitrulline  the list price is  for a day supply the label shown below carries ignarros signature and endorsement states that the product is a dietary supplement   herbalifes web site says that niteworks supports energy vascular and circulatory health promotes a healthy cardiovascular system enhances blood flow to support function of the heart brain and other organs and helps you wake up feeling rejuvenated  an herbalife fact sheet states discoveries relating to nitric oxide led to dr louis ignarro and two other scientists winning the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  herbalife teamed with dr ignarro to develop niteworks™ a lemonflavored powder mix niteworks™ is formulated to help you create more lifesupporting nitric oxide during the night when nitricoxide levels are naturally at their lowest    through vascular nutrition you can increase the production of nitric oxide which “exercises” or expands your vessels increasing their youthful elasticity in addition nitric oxide is an important biological messenger that causes a cascade of benefits at the cellular level which can improve circulatory immune and nervoussystem function nitric oxide influences the functioning of virtually every organ in the body including the lungs liver kidneys stomach brain and of course the heart  in  i noticed that herbalifes product details listed keep blood vessels toned flexible and youthful for improved circulation as a key benefit however there is little scientific support for this claim some studies of arginine supplementation have found possible benefit some have found none and some have found possible harm as far as i know the full niteworks formula has not been tested in a clinical trial that looked for a protective effect against cardiovascular disease ignaros promotion in june  ignarro was featured at herbalifes extravaganza in las vegas where he talked to thousands of enthusiastic herbalife distributors for more than an hour as part of ignarros introduction herbalifes ceo michael o johnson played a video in which ignarro said weve done a lot of work to show that one does not have to take prescription drugs to be effective in treating cardiovascular disease one can just engage in natural sorts of things—dietary supplements    exercise diets that are low in fat and so on all of these things increase or enhance nitric acid production in the body and the more nitric oxide that is produced the more protection you have against cardiovascular disease  the video ended with a plea from ignarro take this message to tens of millions of people out there ignarros walk to the stage was accompanied by loud music rhythmic clapping and audience cheering that resembled what happens when boxers and wrestlers are introduced at championship events before and after speaking ignarro spent several minutes giving autographs to distributors who pressed toward him with papers held high his talk covered his research the physiological characteristics of nitric oxide his nobel award his beliefs about niteworks and what taking the product has done for him his wife and his friends during parts of his talk he seemed euphoric the audience lapped it all up many portions of his talk were met with applause and enthusiastic shouts   click for video clip       the scientific part of ignarros talk was centered around a slide show titled no more heart disease the nitric oxide story after promising to provide easy steps you can take to prevent cardiovascular disease and what we can do to reverse this process he stated that herbalifes cellular nutrition program nourishes all the cells in the body and that nitric oxide can do the same he went on to describe how nitric oxide allows cells to communicate with each other and can help prevent a wide variety of diseases he claimed that among other things it can help lower blood pressure improve blood flow inhibit clotting to prevent strokes and heart attacks prevents against early stages of atherosclerosis prevent vascular complications of diabetes protect against ulcers and alzheimers disease and affect erectile function   click for video clip ignarro further claimed that cardiovascular disease is associated with localized nitric oxide deficiency and that production can be increased by a lowfat diet mildtomoderate exercise smoking cessation and better cellular nutrition niteworks he said contains the amino acid arginine which the body converts to nitric oxide citrulline which the body recycles to arginine and the antioxidant vitamins a and c which protect against the destruction oxidation of nitric oxide although arginine is found in common foods such as meat poultry fish nuts cereals milk and certain vegetables ignarro told the audience you probably dont get sufficient amounts of arginine from your diet    to really get the increased production of nitric oxide that id like to see    youd probably have to eat the whole leg of a cow every day or as a barrel of fish    so you should supplement your diet with arginine    and the same thing goes for citrulline which is another amino acid its found together with arginine but is present in much smaller amounts thats why its particularly important to supplement with citrulline and of course our niteworks product contains both arginine and citrulline after finishing his chemistry lesson ignarro focused on the personal experience of himself his wife and his friends among other things he bragged that after taking niteworks he and his wife greatly improved their treadmill performance and that he slept better and generally felt better he also said that friends had lowered their blood pressure and become less depressed that everyone he knows who took the product had reported substantial benefits and that he really believes that soon there will be no more heart disease this statement was followed by a standing ovation from the audience the fact that mouse studies and haphazardly collected anecdotes do not provide an adequate basis for ignarros conclusions was not mentioned to the audience a few months after the extravaganza the washington post published an article in which ignarro told the reporter that the ingredients in niteworks generate nitric oxide slowly over a prolonged period so that it can be provided when the body needs it however he said that this had been shown so far only in animal studies and testtube studies with human cells ferid murad md phd who directs the institute of molecular medicine at the university of texas medical school at houston and shared the nobel prize with ignarro said that niteworks blend of ingredients makes sense except for lcitrulline which he said acts only marginally in recycling larginine and is probably in the product for patenting reasons murad also said that niteworks permonth price was obscene because the vitamins c and e are available for pennies a day and arginine is obtainable for about a dollar a day  questionable conduct in may  the proceedings of the national academy of sciences published an article by ignarro and  coauthors about a study in which mice with high cholesterol levels who exercised and were given arginine vitamin c and vitamin e were compared to sedentary mice and to mice who exercised but did not get the supplements the researchers found that the supplemented mice developed fewer problems with their coronary arteries  scientific journals require authors to disclose any financial interest they have in the subject matter they write about however the article did not disclose ignarros tie to herbalife or his financial interest in a product related to the study in fact the lack of disclosure and extent of the connection did not come to light until david evans an investigative reporter for bloomberg news learned how much amount of money was involved as reported in documents submitted to the securities and exchange commission as part of herbalifes application to become a publiclyheld company after further investigation evans reported in january  ignarro and david brubaker formed a consulting company called healthwell ventures llc to receive royalties for the sale of niteworks brubaker told evans that herbalife pays healthwell  of niteworks sales revenue since june  healthwell has received  million some of which represented an advance payment when the mouse study was published ucla issued a press release in which ignarro claimed that whats good for mice is good for humans and that the study shows that supplements work well even in the absence of exercise the release didnt name herbalife and didnt disclose ignarros financial interest in niteworks pharmacologist robert furchgott phd who also shared the  nobel prize with ignarro said that ignarros claims of effectiveness are improperly founded they jumped the gun he said i havent seen any properly controlled studies it just seems to me a mouse model isnt transferable to humans he also said i think with the sort of money theyre raking in they could have done some human studies former new england journal of medicine editor marcia angell md agreed that ignarro needs more than mouse studies to support his claims theres a way to find out if it works in humans by conducting clinical trials on people she said you cant assume it will work for people  brubaker who was also an herbalife distributor sells niteworks and other products from his healthwelllife web site from  through  shortly before evanss exposé was published i downloaded a video that contained ignarros las vegas presentation followed by an invitation to order niteworks via brubakers tollfree number ignarros presentation combined with the introduction shown at the extravaganza has also been promoted through the herbalife broadcast network hbn which herbalife international uses to communicate with its distributors ignarro notified the journal editor that he thought that disclosing his financial connection to herbalife was unnecessary because a the study was conceived before he teamed up with herbalife and b he had only played a minor role as a reviewer of the article  however i believe that a the connection was established before the article went to press and b if ignarro did enough to get his name on the article he did enough to require a disclosure moreover the news release associated with the article should have made the disclosure in  a pershing square capital management report noted that since  herbalife had paid ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm more than  million since   in  the los angeles times noted herbalifes support of ucla medical schools center for human nutrition  competition ferid murad phd the third scientist who shared the  nobel award has cast his lot with another manufacturer in december  leiner health products announced that it had created cardio discovery™ which it said was based on  years of research by nobel prize winner dr ferid murad a company press release stated cardio discovery helps support the cardiovascular system by increasing production of nitric oxide naturally produced in the body nitric oxide helps to maintain the flexibility of veins and arteries so that blood flows freely cardio discovery contains the amino acids larginine and lglutamine larginine is one of the body’s key nutrient sources for nitric oxide production which is necessary for the maintenance of a healthy cardiovascular system  the list price was month but some distributors were discounting it now called cardio support the product retails for  applicable laws under federal law products except for devices intended for the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease are drugs and all drugs must be labeled with adequate directions for use labeling includes any written printed or graphic material that accompanies a product and intended use is determined by the facts at hand drugs not generally recognized as safe and effective by experts are considered “new” drugs that cannot be marketed in interstate commerce without fda approval it is a federal crime to market a new drug that lacks approval or does not bear adequate directions the  dietary supplement health and education act dshea permits dietary supplements to be marketed with structurefunction claims that are truthful and supported by scientific evidence  it appears to me that niteworks is intended for the prevention of disease but is not generally recognized by experts as safe and effective for this purpose i also believe that many of the claims made by herbalife and ignarro go beyond what dshea permits for a dietary supplements thus for example the claim that niteworks can lead to no more heart disease appears to be illegal as well as preposterous in  the california attorney general sued herbalife international and its founderpresident mark hughes for making false claims about several products the case was settled in  with a consent agreement under which the defendants paid  in penalties and were permanently barred from making unsubstantiated health claims for any product  in  the federal trade commission took action against the marketers of another argininecontaining product heartbar that was claimed to protect its users against cardiovascular disease  the consent agreement  prohibits unsubstantiated representations that any such product substantially decreases leg pain for people with cardiovascular disease reverses damage or disease to the heart caused by high cholesterol smoking diabetes estrogen deficiency or any other medical condition or health risk prevents agerelated vascular problems including hardening of the arteries and plaque formation or reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease reduces or eliminates the need for surgery such as a coronary bypass or angioplasty or for medications such as nitroglycerin in patients with cardiovascular disease or improves endurance circulation and energy for the general population arginine research as far as i know niteworks has never been studied studied in humans to determine whether it can help people with cardiovascular disease but three studies suggest that one of its key ingredients—arginine—might do more harm than good for people with impaired artery function one study found that giving  grams of arginine per day for  days to  patients with coronary artery disease did not improve the function of the inner lining endothelium of their arteries  another study found that subjects with peripheral artery disease who took arginine supplements for  months did worse than that imilar people who received a placebo  the third study found that  grams of arginine given every day for  months did not improve arterial functioning among  people who had suffered a heart attack but during or shortly after the trial death occurred in six of the argininetakers but none of the placebotakers  the herbalife science web site mentions a clinical trial in which  healthy elderly men who exercised regularly were given either niteworks or a placebo for three weeks the study was supported by an nih grant and done at uclas center for human nutrition the researchers reported that the men who received niteworks were able to do strenuous exercise a bit longer before they got tired  whether this finding has any practical significance remains to be seen the bottom line niteworks is promoted as a powerful preventive against cardiovascular disease even though as far as i know the product has never been studied for this purpose in humans nobel prize winner louis ignarro phd who has a substantial financial interest in the matter is using his prestige to facilitate the sales process although research into nitric oxide may lead to some practical use of arginine supplementation it seems unlikely to result in no more heart disease meanwhile i believe it is foolish to spend  a month for a product that is overpriced has no proven

torre del greco near naples ignarro grew up in long beach ny which is a suburb of new york city ny on the south shore of long island ny ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of  ignarro is married and lives in beverly hills ca he is an avid cyclist and marathoner having completed  marathons ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production he is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics academic careeredit ignarro attended central grade school and long beach high school a strong interest in science led ignarro to columbia university where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in  received a bachelors degree in pharmacy ignarro then attended the university of minnesota where he received a phd in pharmacology his university studies also concentrated in chemistry enzymology and cardiovascular physiology which resulted in several published papers while at the university of minnesota ignarro studied under eventual nobel prizewinning chemist paul boyer ignarros work continued at the nih in the fields hed studied collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work this was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting in  ignarro left the nih to work for geigy pharmaceuticals with this company ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic gmp after geigy merged with ciba pharmaceuticals ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia this time as a professor in  ignarro accepted the position of assistant professor of pharmacology at tulane university school of medicine in new orleans la tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic gmp while studying cyclic gmp ignarro read a paper by ferid murad who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic gmp levels ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles in turn this led to his extensive research on the subject ignarros research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation with both effects mediated by cyclic gmp ignarro continued his research at tulane in  he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previouslyidentified by robert furchgott  years earlier the exact nature of the edrf was up to this point unknown interestingly furchgott and ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the edrf around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during  demonstrating nitric oxides role as edrf during the decades since ignarro and furchgotts initial research thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor this has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance in  ignarro moved from new orleans to los angeles where he accepted a position at the ucla school of medicine and continues to research and teach herbalife relationshipedit ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for herbalife since  and later became a member of the companys scientific advisory board he has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance ignarro first worked with herbalife to develop niteworks a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over  million in the first  months ignarro has continued to work with herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as omega fatty acid and coq as of  herbalife has made payments to ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over  million in  ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in niteworks in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences where as a member of the national academy of sciences he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication after ignarros ties to herbalife were revealed the journal issued a correction to the article citing ignarros undisclosed conflict of interest  ucla conducted its own investigation and determined that ignarro did not act improperly ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide ignarro appears in videos promoting niteworks and other herbalife products and is a frequent speaker at herbalife events since partnering with herbalife ignarro has spoken to more than  people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health famous quotesedit while testifying before congress in  ignarro remarked only in

ferid murad currently he is professor of pharmacology at the ucla school of medicines department of molecular and medical pharmacology in los angeles which he joined in  before relocating to california he was a professor of pharmacology at tulane university school of medicine new orleans for  years ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist research department for the pharmaceutical division of cibageigy corporation in new york ignarro has published numerous research articles he received the basic research prize of the american heart association in  this was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science that same year he was inducted into the national academy of sciences and the following year into the american academy of arts and sciences because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug he is sometimes referred to as the father of viagra he is the founder of the nitric oxide society

is married and lives in beverly hills ca he is an avid cyclist and marathoner having completed  marathons ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production he is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics academic careeredit ignarro attended central grade school and long beach high school a strong interest in science led ignarro to columbia university where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in  received a bachelors degree in pharmacy ignarro then attended the university of minnesota where he received a phd in pharmacology his university studies also concentrated in chemistry enzymology and cardiovascular physiology which resulted in several published papers while at the university of minnesota ignarro studied under eventual nobel prizewinning chemist paul boyer ignarros work continued at the nih in the fields hed studied collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work this was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting in  ignarro left the nih to work for geigy pharmaceuticals with this company ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic gmp after geigy merged with ciba pharmaceuticals ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia this time as a professor in  ignarro accepted the position of assistant professor of pharmacology at tulane university school of medicine in new orleans la tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic gmp while studying cyclic gmp ignarro read a paper by ferid murad who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic gmp levels ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles in turn this led to his extensive research on the subject ignarros research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation with both effects mediated by cyclic gmp ignarro continued his research at tulane in  he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previouslyidentified by robert furchgott  years earlier the exact nature of the edrf was up to this point unknown interestingly furchgott and ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the edrf around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during  demonstrating nitric oxides role as edrf during the decades since ignarro and furchgotts initial research thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor this has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance in  ignarro moved from new orleans to los angeles where he accepted a position at the ucla school of medicine and continues to research and teach herbalife relationshipedit ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for herbalife since  and later became a member of the companys scientific advisory board he has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance ignarro first worked with herbalife to develop niteworks a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over  million in the first  months ignarro has continued to work with herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as omega fatty acid and coq as of  herbalife has made payments to ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over  million in  ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in niteworks in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences where as a member of the national academy of sciences he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication after ignarros ties to herbalife were revealed the journal issued a correction to the article citing ignarros undisclosed conflict of interest  ucla conducted its own investigation and determined that ignarro did not act improperly ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide ignarro appears in videos promoting niteworks and other herbalife products and is a frequent speaker at herbalife events since partnering with herbalife

ignarro born may   is an american pharmacologist for demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide he was corecipient of the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine with robert f furchgott and ferid murad currently he is professor of pharmacology at the ucla school of medicines department of molecular and medical pharmacology in los angeles which he joined in  before relocating to california he was a professor of pharmacology at tulane university school of medicine new orleans for  years ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist research department for the pharmaceutical division of cibageigy corporation in new york ignarro has published numerous research articles he received the basic research prize of the american heart association in  this was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science that same year he was inducted into the national academy of sciences and the following year into the american academy of arts and sciences because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug he is sometimes referred to as the father of viagra he is the founder of the nitric oxide society and founder and editorinchief of nitric oxide biology and chemistry ignarro holds a bs in pharmacy columbia university  and a phd in pharmacology university of minnesota school of medicine  he also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from national institutes of health in  he is a member of the scientific committee of nicox a french pharmaceutical company a member of the board of directors of antibe therapeutics a canadian drug discovery company a member of the board of directors of operation usa a nonprofit organization and a member of the nutritional advisory board

greco near naples ignarro grew up in long beach ny which is a suburb of new york city ny on the south shore of long island ny ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of  ignarro is married and lives in beverly hills ca he is an avid cyclist and marathoner having completed  marathons ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production he is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics academic careeredit ignarro attended central grade school and long beach high school a strong interest in science led ignarro to columbia university where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in  received a bachelors degree in pharmacy ignarro then attended the university of minnesota where he received a phd in pharmacology his university studies also concentrated in chemistry enzymology and cardiovascular physiology which resulted in several published papers while at the university of minnesota ignarro studied under eventual nobel prizewinning chemist paul boyer ignarros work continued at the nih in the fields hed studied collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work this was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting in  ignarro left the nih to work for geigy pharmaceuticals with this company ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic gmp after geigy merged with ciba pharmaceuticals ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia this time as a professor in  ignarro accepted the position of assistant professor of pharmacology at tulane university school of medicine in new orleans la tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic gmp while studying cyclic gmp ignarro read a paper by ferid murad who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic gmp levels ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles in turn this led to his extensive research on the subject ignarros research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation with both effects mediated by cyclic gmp ignarro continued his research at tulane in  he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previouslyidentified by robert furchgott  years earlier the exact nature of the edrf was up to this point unknown interestingly furchgott and ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the edrf around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during  demonstrating nitric oxides role as edrf during the decades since ignarro and furchgotts initial research thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor this has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance in  ignarro moved from new orleans to los angeles where he accepted a position at the ucla school of medicine and continues to research and teach herbalife relationshipedit ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for herbalife since  and later became a member of the companys scientific advisory board he has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance ignarro first worked with herbalife to develop niteworks a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over  million in the first  months ignarro has continued to work with herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as omega fatty acid and coq as of  herbalife has made payments to ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over  million in  ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in niteworks in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences where as a member of the national academy of sciences he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication after ignarros ties to herbalife were revealed the journal issued a correction to the article citing ignarros undisclosed conflict of interest  ucla conducted its own investigation and determined that ignarro did not act improperly ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide ignarro appears in videos promoting niteworks and other herbalife products and is a frequent speaker at herbalife events since partnering with herbalife ignarro has spoken to more than  people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health famous quotesedit while testifying before congress in  ignarro remarked only in america could the son of

ignarro born may   is an american pharmacologist for demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide he was corecipient of the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine with robert f furchgott and ferid murad currently he is professor of pharmacology at the ucla school of medicines department of molecular and medical pharmacology in los angeles which he joined in  before relocating to california he was a professor of pharmacology at tulane university school of medicine new orleans for  years ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist research department for the pharmaceutical division of cibageigy corporation in new york ignarro has published numerous research articles he received the basic research prize of the american heart association in  this was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science that same year he was inducted into the national academy of sciences and the following year into the american academy of arts and sciences because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug he is sometimes referred to as the father of viagra he is the founder of the nitric oxide society and founder and editorinchief of nitric oxide biology and chemistry ignarro holds a bs in pharmacy columbia university  and a phd in pharmacology university of minnesota school of medicine  he also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from national institutes of health in  he is a member of the scientific committee of nicox a french pharmaceutical company a member of the board of directors of antibe therapeutics a canadian drug discovery company a member of the board of directors of operation usa a nonprofit organization and a member of the nutritional advisory board

greco near naples ignarro grew up in long beach ny which is a suburb of new york city ny on the south shore of long island ny ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of  ignarro is married and lives in beverly hills ca he is an avid cyclist and marathoner having completed  marathons ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production he is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics academic careeredit ignarro attended central grade school and long beach high school a strong interest in science led ignarro to columbia university where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in  received a bachelors degree in pharmacy ignarro then attended the university of minnesota where he received a phd in pharmacology his university studies also concentrated in chemistry enzymology and cardiovascular physiology which resulted in several published papers while at the university of minnesota ignarro studied under eventual nobel prizewinning chemist paul boyer ignarros work continued at the nih in the fields hed studied collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work this was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting in  ignarro left the nih to work for geigy pharmaceuticals with this company ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic gmp after geigy merged with ciba pharmaceuticals ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia this time as a professor in  ignarro accepted the position of assistant professor of pharmacology at tulane university school of medicine in new orleans la tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic gmp while studying cyclic gmp ignarro read a paper by ferid murad who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic gmp levels ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles in turn this led to his extensive research on the subject ignarros research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation with both effects mediated by cyclic gmp ignarro continued his research at tulane in  he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previouslyidentified by robert furchgott  years earlier the exact nature of the edrf was up to this point unknown interestingly furchgott and ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the edrf around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during  demonstrating nitric oxides role as edrf during the decades since ignarro and furchgotts initial research thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor this has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance in  ignarro moved from new orleans to los angeles where he accepted a position at the ucla school of medicine and continues to research and teach herbalife relationshipedit ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for herbalife since  and later became a member of the companys scientific advisory board he has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance ignarro first worked with herbalife to develop niteworks a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over  million in the first  months ignarro has continued to work with herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as omega fatty acid and coq as of  herbalife has made payments to ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over  million in  ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in niteworks in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences where as a member of the national academy of sciences he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication after ignarros ties to herbalife were revealed the journal issued a correction to the article citing ignarros undisclosed conflict of interest  ucla conducted its own investigation and determined that ignarro did not act improperly ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide ignarro appears in videos promoting niteworks and other herbalife products and is a frequent speaker at herbalife events since partnering with herbalife ignarro has spoken to more than  people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health famous quotesedit while testifying before congress in  ignarro remarked only in america could the son of

pharmacology member brain research institute research interests the principal objective of my research program is to elucidate the mechanisms of regulation and modulation of nitric oxide no production and cytotoxicity in macrophages vascular cells and tumor cells this laboratory employs a wide variety of techniques and procedures to answer important and timely questions pertaining to the biochemistry molecular biology and pathophysiology of no enzyme protein purification and characterization extensive cell culture systems physiologic methods for assessment of organ and tissue functions various molecular biology techniques northerns westerns southerns gel shift assays and related procedures and various analytical techniques hplc chemiluminescence spectroscopy are techniques routinely employed we make the effort to develop any technique that is required to answer important research questions no is one of the simplest molecules in nature but is synthesized by a complex enzymatic process no synthase is a homodimeric flavohemoprotein that catalyzes the electron oxidation of larginine to no  lcitrulline this enzymatic reaction is similar to that catalyzed by the cytochrome p system and requires numerous cofactors including calmodulin nadph flavins heme and tetrahydrobiopterin no synthase exists as three different isoforms endothelial neuronal and inducible endothelial and neuronal no synthase are constitutively present in select cell types and is activated by intracellular calcium which promotes the binding of calmodulin to the enzyme and thereby activates it the inducible no synthase already has calmodulin tightly bound as a subunit and therefore requires no calcium for enzyme activation it is already activated as it is being synthesized from its mrna no is a very small lipophilic readily diffusible chemically unstable molecule with a very short halflife seconds and produces effects immediately and locally no elicits physiological vasodilation antiplatelet effects neurotransmitter functions and pathophysiological actions septic shock acute and chronic inflammation destruction of invading bacteria viruses and tumor cells two different constitutively present isoforms of no synthase endothelial and neuronal nos are responsible for biosynthesis of small physiologically important amounts of no such small amounts of no are completely noncytotoxic an inducible isoform of no synthase which a distinct gene product from the constitutive isoforms is responsible for highoutput production of no generation of large amounts of no is associated with cytotoxicity and pathophysiology examples include induction of no synthase in vascular smooth muscle resulting in profound vasorelaxation and hypotension the characteristics of endotoxin shock induction of no synthase in brain microglia and astrocytes thereby resulting in production of large amounts of no which permeate nearby oligodendrocytes resulting in impaired myelin production the hallmark feature of multiple sclerosis induction of no synthase in joint tissues resulting in acute and chronic inflammation characteristic signs of arthritic disease research efforts in this laboratory are directed toward better understanding the factors that influence no production and cytotoxicity studies are focused on the transcriptional regulation of inducible no synthase and the involvement of nfkb and other transcription factors in the inducible expression of the no synthase gene separate projects focus on the mechanism by which oxidative stress triggers activation of nfkb and induction of hostdefense proteins the relationship between oxidative stress and signal transduction in inducible gene expression is a major area of current focus additional projects address the roles of phosphorylation and proteolysis in gene transcription pertaining to the cytotoxic actions of no studies focus on the chemistry of no as a reactive species with iron and copper and how such reactivity alters cell function the doubleedged role of no as both a protective species and deleterious species is intriguing and under investigation in various cell types including tumor cells as no appears to have potent tumoricidal activity additional specific aims focus on  coinduction of no synthase and arginase and arginine transporters in macrophages and vascular cells to understand the factors affecting arginine availability for no synthase catalyzed no production  mechanisms by which certain combinations of lipopolysaccharide plus cytokines cause rapidly developing death in certain cell types but not others  mechanisms by which no injures target cells and microorganisms without injuring cells that produce no  elucidation of the role of tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor for no synthase  elucidation of the mechanism by which no causes a negative feedback effect on no synthase to inhibit its own synthesis  elucidation of the mechanism by which no activates guanylate cyclase the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic gmp an important second messenger that mediates the physiological actions of no  determination of the factors that affect the transcriptional expression and posttranslational modifications of guanylate cyclase this laboratory made the original observations that no is a vasodilator  and inhibitor of platelet aggregation  that no elicits its biological actions via the second messenger cyclic gmp  that no activates guanylate cyclase by hemedependent mechanisms  that the endotheliumderived relaxing factor is no that no is the neurotransmitter in nonadrenergicnoncholinergic neurons innervating the erectile tissue of the penis and is responsible for penile erection  that no is a negative feedback modulator of no synthase  and that aspirin and related drugs interfere with the inducible expression of the no synthase gene  therefore this laboratory is committed to continued and persistent research into the biology and

strokeby ignarro louis jdr louis ignarro discovered the atom of cardiovascular healtha tiny molecule called nitric oxide no as it is known by chemists is a signaling molecule produced by the body and is a vasodilator that helps control blood flow to every part of the body dr ignarros findings led to the development of viagra nitric oxide has a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system as wellno relaxes and enlarges the blood vessels prevents blood clots that trigger strokes and heart attacks and regulates blood pressure and the accumulation of plaque in the blood vessels dr ignarros current research indicates that nitric oxide may help lower cholesterol by facilitating the actions of statin drugs like lipitor the goal of the regimen presented in no more heart disease is to age proof the cardiovascular system keeping the vascular network clean and elastic through enhanced no productivity the plan is easytofollow without extreme lifestyle adjustments involving taking supplements to stimulate nitric oxide production incorporating no friendly food into the diet and a moderate exercise programheartcondition used  goodhpb condition ratingsnew item is brand new unused
