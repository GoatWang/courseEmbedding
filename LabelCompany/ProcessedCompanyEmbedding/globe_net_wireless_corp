areas use either standard wifi b or satellite technology wifi  b b products appeared on the market in early  b has a maximum raw data rate of  mbps with average throughput of about mbps b devices suffer interference from other products operating in the ghz band when implemented as a rural internet solution the path between the transmission tower and the receiving equipment must be in direct lineofsight or better obstructions such as trees or snow can cause connection problems wifi services typically offer speeds of up to mbps download and mbps upload prices can be relatively low but speed reliability and availability are all common issues satellite satellite internet service is available in even the remotest locations however satellite also requires a completely clear lineofsight between the dish and the satellite for the system to work in addition to the signal being susceptible to absorption and scattering by moisture it is similarly impacted by the presence of trees and other vegetation in the path of the signal most consumer satellite systems operate above  ghz making them sensitive to even minor obstructions such as cloudy skies heavy rain or leaves on the receiving dish typical satellite services offer speeds of up to mbps download and kbps upload pricing can be quite high and problems such as low speeds inconsistent connections and high latency are common for most major providers bringing internet service to these remote locations is simply an unprofitable proposition either because there are not enough potential customers or because it is too costly to justify expansion of their network in the area some competitors of globe net include omnicity corp a public company located in rushville indiana and machlink corporation a private company located in edmonton alberta canada the gnw system offers faster internet speeds than what some competing companies are currently offering to their rural subscribers while higher download speeds are immediately obvious to most internet users ie loading pages faster downloading content faster faster upload speeds achievable through the use of the gnw system will appeal to commercial and business users as information can be sent from the location faster this is a definite advantage for organizations running servers that often transmit information ie medical governmental or transmit large amounts of information ie file server content provider some people still regard higher internet speed as a luxury only good for loading web pages faster or downloading the latest music videos quicker however having faster internet provides many more advantages not only for consumers but for businesses as well increased productivity – users can retrieve large documents research information and send and receive email quicker rural business employees do not need to go on trips to other locations for meetings instead they can join web conferences allowing businesses save time that would otherwise be spent on several days of travel as well as on money for flights hotels meals and rental cars increased flexibility – broadband internet makes working at home possible users can remotely connect to their office computers and perform tasks as if they were in that office this makes it possible for employees in remote areas to work as part of a larger office environment without the expense of traveling to and from work internet telephony – rural users really take advantage of voiceoverip voip for their telephone service in areas were cellular phone coverage is nonexistent or unreliable and landline service is only partially available voip is a good solution plus with typically lower monthly and long distance fees voip users can realize substantial cost savings voip will not work well with satellite internet because of the high latency inherent in that technology expanded communications – many people use programs like skype and google chat to video conference or voice chat with family members and friends businesses use web conferencing to have meetings or realtime collaboration software to work on teamcentric projects educational establishments are using it to reach out to students who cannot attend classes physically or post videos of lectures for students to download and review at a later time all of these applications require highspeed access multimedia entertainment – faster internet delivers better multimedia entertainment without real broadband connectivity viewing videos or downloading music is not a satisfying experience in fact some services will not even work without a fast enough internet connection also with the gnw system globe net can bring the internet to areas where wifi service cannot reach simply because the gnw system is not as susceptible to the pitfalls that affect the other technologies and will not be prone to these interference problems lineofsight  wifi relies on having direct lineofsight between the transmission tower and the receiving antenna leaving many locations unserviceable for example with trees or other vegetation in the signal path between the source and receiver wifi service would not work satellite internet requires a clear lineofsight between the receiving dish and the orbiting satellite so inclement weather such as snow or heavy rain or even cloudy skies can adversely affect the service the gnw system’s lower operating frequency will allows its signal to pass through buildings trees and other obstacles thereby reaching locations wifi simply cannot “see” interference  wifi operates at ghz other devices operating at this frequency like microwave ovens bluetooth devices baby monitors and cordless telephones will interfere with a wifi signal satellite systems are prone to rain fade degradation during heavy precipitation and occasional brief periods of solar interference in midmarch and late september when the sun lines up with the satellite for a few minutes each day rain fade and solar interference affect all satellite links from time to time not just internet systems company description globe net is a nevada company and was incorporated on september   globe net is a
