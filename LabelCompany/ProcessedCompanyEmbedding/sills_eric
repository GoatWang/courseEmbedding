the questionandanswer session operator instructions please note this call may be recorded and i’ll be standing by should you need any assistance it is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to mr larry sills executive chairman of standard motor products please go ahead sir larry sills good morning everyone we welcome you to our first quarter conference call and we thank you for taking the time to attend here from the company is eric sills president and ceo jim burke executive vice president and chief financial officer and myself larry sills executive chairman our agenda for the morning will be first jim will review the numbers of the quarter second eric will review the progress of some of our latest initiatives and then we’ll open for questions so let’s start with jim jim burke okay thank you larry as a preliminary note i would like to point out that some of the material we will be discussing today may include forwardlooking statements regarding our business and expected financial results when we use words like anticipate believe estimate or expect these are generally forwardlooking statements although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forwardlooking statements are reasonable they are based on information currently available to us and certain assumptions made by us and we cannot assure you that they will prove correct you should also read our filings with the securities and exchange commission for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements looking at the pl consolidated net sales in q  were  million up  million or  this significant increase is primarily related to two factors first  million wire sales from our general cable acquisition completed at the end of may  excluding the gc volume our consolidated net sales increased  the second significant increase was from stronger preseason temp control orders following the warm  season by segment engine management net sales in q  were  million up  million or  excluding the gc wire acquisition incremental sales engine management sales were up  million or  this increase reflects higher pipeline orders from certain customers as they are increasing their inventory coverage temp control net sales in q  were  million up  million or  this significant percentage increase reflects the higher preseason orders in anticipation of another warm season as experienced in  consolidated gross margin dollars in q were up  million at  down  points looking at the margins by segment engine management gross margin was  down  points versus q  margins were off slightly related to lower margins in our gc wire acquisition sales not present last year we expect the gc margins to improve significantly once we have combined the acquired operations in nogales mexico into our existing reynosa mexico operation in addition we are incurring additional costs during our multiple transition moves temp control gross margin was  up  points versus q  margins benefited from higher production levels and our continued efforts and focus on reducing costs total sga expenses were  million in q at  of net sales versus  last year the gc wire acquisition was beneficial gaining leverage on our sga spend as we have integrated our wire sales marketing and distribution functions during  the sga percentage also benefited from the higher temp control preseason orders shipped consolidated operating income before restructuring and integration expenses and other income net in q  was  million  of net sales versus  million  of net sales last year reflecting a  point improvement operating income dollars were up in both segments and our restructuring initiatives underway should improve this performance further the net effect of our operational results as reported on our nongaap reconciliation was q  diluted earnings per share of  versus  last year which is almost a  increase looking at the balance sheet our working capital needs increased as we entered the spring and summer seasons ar increased  million since december  primarily with the strong temp control preseason orders inventories increased  million since december as we build inventories for the summer season and also bridge inventory builds with our multiple facility moves underway accounts payable increased  million partially offsetting the rise in receivables and inventories total debt increased  million to fund our working capital needs these working capital increases are expected as we enter q and q and then we begin to monetize these investments through q and q our cash flow statement reflects a  million use of cash in q  versus only  million use last year this increase reflects the higher working capital needs slightly offset by higher net earnings capital expenditures were  million slightly below the  million level in q  we anticipate this spend level to increase over the balance of the year to the  millionplus range for the full year compared to  million in  this reflects our continued focus to reinvest in our businesses in february  we announced a  million board of directors authorized repurchase program for our common stock in q  we repurchased  shares at a cost of  million or  a share in q  through the end of april we repurchased another  shares at a cost of roughly  million or  a share leaving us a remaining  million authorization for future repurchases in summary we are pleased with the results in the quarter and future initiatives to strengthen our business for the longterm thank you for your attention and i will turn the call over to eric eric sills thanks jim and good morning everybody jim has covered the numbers and as you’ve heard we’re quite pleased sales were obviously quite strong however it is important to note that in both of our divisions a portion of the sales was geared towards customer pipelines rather than strong demand through the channel as you’ve seen from first quarter earnings calls from our large publicly traded customers q was a bit of a challenge overall and we did see that to varying degrees with how they did with our product lines as well i’ll talk about the two divisions separately in engine management our customers’ pos was slightly down meanwhile their purchases from us were up fairly substantially if you exclude the acquired general cable business our engine management sales out were about  up few of our customers determined the need to expand their assortment and deployed broader inventories throughout their system they therefore placed heavierthannormal line update orders as they reset their planograms as you know a key to growth in the difm business is to have broad coverage and rapid delivery so working with our category management team they identified coverage gaps and sought to fill those gaps in temp control our customers did post slight increases in pos but the dollars are small as q is always a light quarter as a weatherrelated business our first quarter is almost entirely about preseason orders as our customers get ready for the summer we see this every year but this year the preseason orders have come in heavier which reflects the impact of last year’s hot summer where they ended the season a bit lighter on inventory than usual so we therefore believe that the customer actions within both divisions do bode well for the future as we believe that these strategic purchasing decisions will help them secure sales going forward but as we always reiterate one should look at our performance yearoveryear as quarterly activities can cause some temporary peaks and valleys so i won’t spend any more time on the numbers i thought i’d spend a few minutes talking about recent initiatives and then we’ll open it up for qa first an update on general cable we’re nearing the anniversary of this acquisition and other than planned integration and efficiencies it’s performing quite well sales have been solid and we’ve retained all the accounts we’ve greatly improved our shipping performance our fill rates across the board to all of these accounts and the acquired plant in nogales is doing really quite well the integration is proceeding on plan as announced the distribution all moved last year and we have now moved the manufacturing for several accounts without any hiccups we’re on target with the buildout of an additional  square feet in our reynosa wire plant to accommodate the balance of the production lines which will all be moved by the end of the first quarter of next year so overall within wire and cable  will remain a transition year with lots of moving pieces and while we fully expect to achieve all of the planned synergies we won’t be all the way there with our profit improvement until next year we’ve also been quite active with other plant moves we’re making strides in winding down our grapevine texas plant a project we’ve been working on since early of last year to remind you there were two elements in grapevine where we did all of our diesel products as well as a bunch of our temperature control all of the diesel lines have now moved to our injector plant in greenville south carolina and are performing really quite well greenville is our center of excellence for fuel delivery products and we’re excited to see what they’re going to be able to do with this line the temp control products are all slated to move to reynosa we’ve expanded into an additional building there which is now fully up and running we’ve moved several of the lines already and have a handful of lines left to go we’re on target to be out of grapevine by the end of the year and we’re actively marketing the building and the product we are very pleased to note that many of the grapevine employees have elected to take other jobs with us mostly at our louisville location close by but also in south carolina and we’re very excited that they’ve chosen to stay with us as discussed on our last earnings call we are now also in the process of closing our electronics plant in orlando and relocating it to independence kansas to remind you of the rationale orlando is an excellent hightech plant but quite small less than  people and only about  square feet and meanwhile independence is quite large and diverse and manufactures many other similar electronic products and they can easily absorb all the orlando production and allow us to be a much more effective manufacturer seeking synergies between the two operations this will be a multiphased move which will take us into the middle of next year to complete the first phase will soon be underway and everything is on schedule so for all of our employees in both grapevine and orlando we really would like to thank you publicly you’ve been terrific throughout this entire process it’s been a difficult time but you’ve continued to operate your plans with pride performed at a high level and are helping to make this successful so you do truly have our sincere gratitude so in closing we are very pleased with the quarter we have a great team here at standard and with their talents i and the rest of the senior management team here at standard we’re very excited about our future so with that i will turn it back over to the moderator and we will open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we’ll take our first question from scott stember with cl king please go ahead scott stember good morning guys and very nice quarter eric sills thanks scott jim burke thanks scott scott stember can you maybe just talk about sellin eric you talked about how your customers are talking about how things were a little sluggish in the quarter maybe just talk a little bit more about what they’re saying what they’re hearing whether it’s weather related or just timing or tough comparisons with a year ago and maybe just talk about – maybe just reaffirm your expectations for the segment if you could eric sills the quarter – different customers had slightly different experiences in the quarter with the two different product lines and – but i don’t think it’s anything that has any longerterm impacts overall we see our engine management business is going to increase barring any major gains or losses of business it’s going to roll with the trends of the overall market up a couple of percentage points yearoveryear temp control is entirely based on the summer and so here we are in early may we’ll see what the next few months bring but we don’t get too hung up in what happened in a particular quarter and we’ll just see what happens as the year progresses scott stember got it and on the margin side a couple of items you talked about general cable mixing in and some of the redundancies with the facility moves can you maybe just – it sounds as if the lion’s share of the contraction came from the latter can you maybe just confirm that maybe just talk about that a little bit jim burke yes scott this is jim burke so again part of the – on the general cable the volume there – when we took it over the margins were lower and fully anticipated to bring them up once we consolidated the businesses they have a higher mix of oeoes business that’s in there which margins will be different than our aftermarket but then we have lower sga we are incurring incremental costs as you start up in a new area and wind down in the other and really there’s a lot of moving parts the key is we expect these margins to improve to the engine management levels and you’ll see further improvements once we complete all the moves by the end of q  scott stember got it and maybe on the sga line you definitely had some nice advances in leverage some of the things you talked about with general cable and some of the consolidations there but maybe just give us a framework of where you see in absolute dollar terms the line item going i guess for the balance of the year on a quarterly basis jim burke yes we came in at  million for the quarter and q and q because of our sales volumes will pick up that’s in there so again that’s probably the low end of the number that we would be in and again i’ve talked consistently that we’re more in absolute dollars than as a percent when you’re looking at our spend so from the  million we would size up obviously in q and q and then q it really depends how much volume but we’re probably in that same range again there so i would say the low point per quarter is  million we size up a little bit in q and  scott stember got it and one just last question maybe on new products i know that you guys have a lot of things in the pipeline and you’ve talked about numerous times maybe just talk about whether it’s diesel injectors or some of the new technologies in cars today that are leading to increased uses of your parts maybe just give us an idea of how that’s going and thanks for taking my questions eric sills sure absolutely scott well yes we do always have several new product lines that we are adding and growing with it’s important to note that a lot of times any sales growth that we see on newer categories is really replacing older technology as it’s falling off the backside of its life cycle but we do have several going on right now one that we’ve been talking about a bunch recently is diesel where if you go back a couple of years  we really used that to get our house in order  we started to see the fruits of that and here first quarter of  we’re continuing to see sales in our overall diesel offering up in north of  growth yearoveryear so diesel is a really exciting category for us and we see a lot of upside there continuing to see growth in our techsmart offering one new thing that maybe i’ll highlight just briefly is we developed several years ago a compressed natural gas injector for heavyduty markets and really it was – we had the product and we’re waiting for the market to develop here in early  we are starting to see a nice uptick as the china market starts to adopt the technology a little bit better yes it’s a small piece of what we do but just another example of where we’re always looking for complementary product categories scott stember great that’s all i have thanks again eric sills thank you scott operator operator instructions we’ll take our next question from bret jordan with jefferies please go ahead bret jordan hey good morning guys eric sills good morning bret jordan hi on the pos topic i guess if you look at maybe cadence or trajectory of the sellthrough as the quarter progressed and maybe anything that you’ve sort of seen anecdotally in april just that from an industry demand standpoint obviously that’s been talked a lot about the weak first quarter for your customers eric sills within – i don’t have the monthovermonth numbers but within the quarter like i said engine management was slightly soft temperature control was okay it’s really a little too early to tell what’s happening in this quarter especially engine management not particularly a weatherrelated product line and temperature control as we’ve said numerous times we really have to wait and see what happens going forward bret jordan okay and then i guess from a temperature control channel inventory standpoint obviously a lot of early seasonal orders if you looked at the inventory with your customers yearoveryear did they start out particularly light or are they holding more inventory now versus where they were a year ago eric sills i believe that they started out this year a bit lighter than they started out last year which is reflecting the fact that not only was last summer hot but it stayed hot long so what typically happens is towards the end of a season they will stop reordering from us and sell them from their own shelves and that is what we saw happen in  so i believe that what we saw this year is they started out lighter than they started  and now they are probably equally positioned for the season as they were last year bret jordan okay and then one last question on margins you talked about the engine management the wire margin improving significantly is there sort of gradual improvement or more of like a step function where we get to  you shut the plant and then we really pick up the margin should we expect that margin to uptick gradually over the next  months or is it mostly – is it sort of going to be an abrupt uptick jim burke yes again jim burke it’ll be more gradual that’s in there we’ll see some improvements coming over the second half of the year that we would see there and then the balance it won’t be a full step item that’s in there bret bret jordan okay great thank you eric sills you’re welcome operator and we have no further questions at this time larry sills okay well thank you all thank you all for attending just to summarize what you’ve been hearing we’re pleased with the first quarter the year was off to a good start but then again it is only the first quarter however as you’ve heard we have many initiatives in place and we have an excellent group of people to carry them out as a result we look forward to the balance of the year so thank you all for attending jim burke all right goodbye eric sills thank you operator this does conclude today’s call you may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day
