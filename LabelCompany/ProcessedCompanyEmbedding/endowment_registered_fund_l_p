portfolio the board of directors of each fund adopts the proxy voting policies and procedures of the adviser and subadvisers as the proxy voting policies and procedures that will be used by each of these respective entities when exercising voting authority on behalf of the fund these policies and procedures are attached hereto � iii retention of proxy voting authority with respect to proxies issued by the master fund the feeder funds do not delegate to the adviser but instead retain their proxy voting authority after receiving a proxy issued by the master fund the feeder fund will hold a meeting of its partners at which the partners will vote their interests to instruct the feeder fund to vote for or against the matter presented by the master fund the feeder fund will then calculate the proportion of interests voted for to those voted against ignoring for purposes of this calculation the interests for which it receives no voting instructions and will subsequently vote its interests in the master fund for or against the matter in the same proportion � iv consent in the event of a conflict of interest if for a particular proxy vote the adviser or subadviser seeks a fund�s consent to vote because of a conflict of interest or for other reasons any two independent directors of the fund may provide the fund�s consent to vote � v annual review of proxy voting policies of adviser and subadvisers the board of directors of each fund will review on an annual basis the proxy voting policies of the adviser and subadvisers applicable to the fund dated march�  as amended march�  endowment advisers lp proxy voting policies and procedures the following are proxy voting policies and procedures �policies and procedures� adopted by endowment advisers lp �endowment advisers� an investment adviser registered with the us securities and exchange commission �sec� under the investment advisers act of  as amended �advisers act� with respect to voting securities held by client portfolios clients include the endowment registered fund lp the endowment tei fund lp and the endowment registered master fund lp the �funds� each of which is an investment company registered with the sec under the investment company act of  as amended � act� and may include in the future other registered investment companies as well as individuals partnerships and corporations these policies and procedures are adopted to ensure compliance by endowment advisers with rule  under the advisers act and other applicable fiduciary obligations under rules and regulations of the sec and interpretations of its staff endowment advisers follows these policies and procedures for each of its clients as required under the advisers act and other applicable law unless expressly directed by a client in writing to refrain from voting that client�s proxies or to vote in accordance with the client�s proxy voting policies and procedures with respect to the funds endowment advisers follows both these policies and procedures and the proxy voting policies and procedures adopted by the funds and their boards of directors i definitions a �best interest of clients� in the view of endowment advisers this means clients� best economic interest over the long term � that is the common interest that all clients share in seeing the value of a common investment increase over time clients may have differing political or social interests but their best economic interest is generally uniform b �material conflict of interest� circumstances when endowment advisers or any member of its senior management or any of its portfolio managers or portfolio analysts knowingly does business with a particular proxy issuer or closely affiliated entity which may appear to create a material conflict between the interests of endowment advisers and the interests of its clients in how proxies of that issuer are voted � ii general policy where endowment advisers is given responsibility for voting proxies we must take reasonable steps under the circumstances to ensure that proxies are received and voted with a view to enhancing the value of the shares of stock held in client accounts these policies and procedures expressly address the voting of proxies or securities with respect to which the issuers solicit proxies to vote on proposals that are put to a vote of shareholders each fund may invest all or some portion of its assets in the securities of privately placed investment vehicles �private investment funds� which do not typically convey traditional voting rights to the holder and the occurrence of corporate governance or other notices for this type of investment is substantially less that encountered in connection with registered equity securities on occasion however each fund or its general partners may receive notices from the private investment funds seeking the consent of holders in order to materially change certain rights within the structure of the security issued by the private investment fund or change material terms of the private investment fund�s constituent documents endowment advisers shall follow these policies and procedures to the extent applicable in exercising the rights of the funds to vote or consent in connection with its investments in private investment funds the advisor shall take such action as may be necessary to enable the funds to comply with all disclosure and recordkeeping obligations imposed by applicable rules and regulations the financial interest of our clients is the primary consideration in determining how proxies should be voted in the case of social and political responsibility issues that in our view do not primarily involve financial considerations the diversity of our clients means that we are unable to represent each such view in each instance thus endowment advisers exercises its vote on these issues in what it believes to be the best economic interests of its clients unless a private account client has provided specific instructions otherwise for its voting securities when making specific proxy decisions endowment advisers generally adheres to its specific voting policies contained in section vi herein the guidelines set forth positions of endowment advisers on recurring issues and criteria for addressing nonrecurring issues the general voting policies of endowment advisers are described below � iii general voting policies a client�s best interest these policies and procedures are designed and implemented in a way that is reasonably expected to ensure that proxies are voted in the best interest of clients proxies will be voted with the aim of furthering the best economic interests of clients promoting high levels of corporate governance and adequate disclosure of company policies activities and returns including fair and equal treatment of shareholders b shareholder activism endowment advisers seeks to develop relationships with the management of portfolio companies to encourage transparency and improvements in the treatment owners and stakeholders thus endowment advisers may engage in dialogue with the management of portfolio companies with respect to pending proxy voting issues c casebycase basis while these policies and procedures guide our decisions each proxy vote is ultimately cast on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the contractual obligations under the advisory agreement or comparable document and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote endowment advisers may cast proxy votes in favor of management proposals or seek to change the views of management considering specific issues as they arise on their merits endowment advisers may also join with other investment managers in seeking to submit a shareholder proposal to a company or to oppose a proposal submitted by the company any such action is primarily based on grounds of fundamental share value d individualized these policies and procedures are tailored to suit the advisory business of endowment advisers and the types of securities portfolios it manages to the extent that clients have adopted their own procedures endowment advisers may vote the same securities differently depending upon clients� directions e material conflicts of interest material conflicts are resolved in the best interest of clients when a material

f limitations the circumstances under which endowment advisers may take a limited role in voting proxies include the following  no responsibility endowment advisers will not vote proxies for client

such clients  limited value endowment advisers may abstain from voting a client proxy if the effect on shareholders� economic interests or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or insignificant  unjustifiable costs endowment advisers may abstain from voting a client proxy for cost reasons  securities lending arrangements if voting securities are part of a securities lending program endowment advisers may be unable to vote while the securities are on loan  special considerations the responsibilities of endowment advisers for voting proxies are determined generally by its

of a company � could trigger various restrictions under the federal securities laws including under the proxy solicitation beneficial ownership and shortswing profit liability provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended in the event that endowment advisers wishes to discuss its voting intentions outside the firm endowment advisers should consult with its counsel before any such discussions b operational procedures  role of the proxy administrator once a client account is established and the proxy voting responsibility is determined the proxy administrator �pa� is responsible

proxies in the same proportion as the votes of other proxy holders that are not clients of endowment advisers �if possible erect information barriers around the person or persons making voting
