these properties are not only hard to locate but once identified getting the proper permits is not easy generally lease rates for the medical marijuana industry are substantially above traditional retail or commercial lease rates this is due to limited industry experience and higher than normal revenue per square foot these leases tend to produce yields more consistent with highend specialty
