review business hours please call to confirm mon am  pm tuesday am  pm wednesday am  pm thursday am  pm friday am  pm saturday am  pm coverage area best questions to ask a remodeler contractor what is your projected timeline for the additions and remodels project in muskegon though a standard question its important to ask most contractors will tell you how long they expect the job to take without you asking if they dont volunteer that information be sure to ask its also helpful to ask if thats a hard finish date meaning that its the definite finish date if its a soft finish date it may be extended for any number of reasons what guarantees andor warranties can you give me are you a warranty agent for any brands these first two questions should only relate to services or good purchased directly from the service provider many products carry their own warranties like roofing shingles or siding its useful to know what these warranties cover as well as how long they last the warranty agent question is important because often warranty agents work with the manufacturer to get you repairs under warranty at a much lower price how many contractors do you have working for you how many vehicles are in your fleet this is important mostly for larger jobs clearly a two man operation is going to build a home much slower than a  man crew this is also a good indication of the overall size of the additions and remodels company if thats an area of concern for you the reason you may want to ask about the fleet is that fleet size is a good indicator of the mobility of the company mobility may not sound important but its hard for the muskegon contractors to get to job sites if they lack appropriate vehicles do you hire properly documented additions and remodels workers this will be answered when you ask if all employees are licensed the only way to obtain a legitimate tradesmans license is to be a legal or naturalized citizen of the us the company may employ people in positions that dont require a license however so its wise to inquire does the additions and remodels job require permits if so will you be pulling them yourself many jobs in michigan will require municipal permits in order to be approved by the towns inspector its always good to ask who will be responsible for pulling those permits and if youll be expected to do it youll almost never be told to pull your own but knowing that muskegon additions and remodels permits are required makes you appear to be a well informed customer let us find additions and remodels professionals for you request online
