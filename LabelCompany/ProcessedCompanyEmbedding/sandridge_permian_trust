while investment tyler crowe tmfdirtybird jun   at pm source eric kounce via commonswikimediaorg editorial note this article was updated on may th  from the original article published on june th  sandridge permian trusts nyse per spectacular distribution yield of almost  is enough to make just about every income investor say this is too good to be true in the case of royalty trusts that can very much be the case now that sandridge energy nyse sd has drilled its last well as part of the covenants with the permain trust the sandridge permian trust will go into a state of perpetual decline until sandridge dissolves the trust in  so the question for longterm investors is if they can make a decent return on the trust through its distributions before the party is over to better understand this lets run through a series of scenarios that will help give a clearer picture of what to expect from this trust over the long term if you are looking at a royalty trust for the first time and are not quite sure what they are and how they operate check out this quick primer  its not a stock so change your mindseta big trap for investors is to think that a royalty trust is a stock its not over the long term share prices in a royalty trust should perpetually be in decline as the reserve base for that royalty trust is diminished the only way a share price can go up is if the value of that commodity goes up faster than the reserve declines so when making an investment in an royalty trust you should base your decision solely on whether the distributions that the trust will exceed the price you pay for a share  the sandridge permian trust is quite possibly the most direct way an individual investor can make an investment on oil in the permian basin unlike the other trusts that have been issued by sandridge energy the permian trust is predominately an oil trust its current production is more than  oil compared to the sandridge mississippian trust i nyse sdt and sandridge mississippian trust ii nyse sdr which produce about  and  oil respectively  so in this specific case we are making the bet that oil from the wells in this particular part of the permian basin will generate a return over the life of the wells greater than our original investment and hopefully that return will be superior to other investment opportunities  breaking down the return scenariosin reality we cant predict the longterm return of a royalty trust because frankly we have no way of knowing what the price of oil will be in the future instead we can look at the physical characteristics of the wells and how that will impact the distribution over time today sandridge estimates that the permian trust has about  million barrels of oil equivalent that can be extracted based on todays oil prices based on the most recent production numbers the trust has a reserve to production ratio of a little more than  years for the trust to last until its terminal date in  though that would mean todays production would need to decline  on average to make the reserve last the entire duration of the trust using this decline estimate and the current annual distribution we can project a rough estimate of the trusts longtime return lets assume the trusts distribution declines at the same rate as production and that when the trust is liquidated at the end of its life you get  of the current value of the trust using this assumption the estimated return over the life of the trust would look something like this source k via secgov authors calculations so based on those assumptions and were the price oil to remain constant throughout the life of the trust then you could potentially generate a greater than  your money over this  year period of course there are likely to be some changes on oil prices over this time so heres what those returns would look like if oil prices were to swing  in either direction  scenario estimated return over life of trust  years compounded annual growth rate oil prices remain constant   oil prices increase    oil prices decrease    authors note these projections assume that distributions from the trust are not reinvested back into the trust based on these projections an optimistic return on the trust would be an annualized compounded return of  which assumes that oil prices over the life of the life of the trust will be  higher than what they are today that isnt too much of a stretch considering where oil prices are today since  when records were first kept the sp  has an inflationadjusted compounded annual growth rate of  so investing directly in the permain trust has the potential to do much better  the one thing that you need to consider though is that half of the royalty revenue over the past  months has come from settlements of futures contracts that have allowed the trust to realize higher than market prices on its oil as these hedging contracts expire the trust will be more exposed to the market price of crude oil today and will likely result in much lower distributions  what a fool believesif you were to invest in the sandridge permian trust and hold it until its liquidation its very likely you wont lose money so if you are looking to protect your principal over a year period then perhaps the sandridge permian trust is a place to invest since it will likely beat inflation in fact at toadys low share price there is a pretty good chance that the trusts distribution returns could be greater than the sp  the one concern is that the expiration of those derivative contracts will significantly decrease the trusts distributions over the next couple of quarters at the same time its future is completely reliant on where oil prices go from here if history has taught us anything its that there is no real way for us to know this investors who want to play it safe shouldnt count on oil prices to rise any time soon based on this there are probably better opportunities out there tyler crowe has no position in any
