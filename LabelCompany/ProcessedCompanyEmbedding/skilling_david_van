trws credit bureau and now he has ambitious plans for the independent outfit thats succeeding itseptember  john odell  times staff writer when the big red trw sign is lowered from its perch atop an orange county highrise in coming weeks it will symbolize the huge changes occurring at a company that touches virtually every consumer with a credit card or loantrw information systems  servicesthe company that helped create the credit information business launched a million bond sale broke away from its clevelandbased parent and struck out on its own under a new name experianall last weekleading the most ambitious change in the companys year history is a courtly whitehaired executive who in the words of one admirer looks like a buttoneddown corporate manager but thinks like a freewheeling entrepreneurat  david van diest skillinghe prefers to be called vanhad two years to go before a forced retirement from trw but he was not about to go quietlya loyal company man to the outside world he argued inside the corporation that the unit he ran was misunderstood and underutilizeda salesandmarketing outfit awkwardly grafted onto a company run by engineers who were rooted in the manufacturing worldplay me or trade me skilling urged seeking a pledge from trw to either let information systems use its cash to grow or sell the unit that last year earned  million on revenue of  millionthe campaign paid off earlier this year trw sold an  stake in the information unit for  billion to an investment group that includes skilling and most of the units top managers in a move industry analysts see as a vote of confidence in the new business trw retains a  stake in experianskilling general manager of orangebased information systems since  now is chairman and chief executive of experian and hes free of the corporate strictures he felt were holding him backi cant imagine a more exciting opportunity for all of us he saysthe transformation of trw information systems is likely to excite more than its employees though the company has ambitious plans to go worldwide with existing services and an array of new productsciting competitive reasons skilling declines to discuss new products his company is developing but they most certainly will give customers faster access to detailed information about millions of people theyll make credit checks quicker and more accurate the kind of service that already enables department stores to offer customers instant credit approval for example and theyll provide refined marketing data so mailing lists can be tailored to increasingly specific audiencesthis will probably loosen a bonanza of data to be gobbled up by informationhungry businesses therell be more opportunities for prospective landlords employers lenders and marketers to obtain information on consumers personal assets and credit histories and more catalogs credit card applications and targeted advertising will be piling up in the daily mailindustry insiders say experian has a powerful new toola million hightech system that can pull data from its files on  million people and  million businesses and produce customized packages of information with far more accuracy and speed than has been possible beforewant a mailing list of highincome santa monica residents who own vacation homes like boats and are likely to pay their debts no problemthe datagathering blitz is likely to intensify as big rivals such as equifax inc trans union corp and dun  bradstreet introduce an array of new products to protect their territorieswere all a little bit wary admits harry gambill president and chief executive of chicagobased trans union this means the business can only become more competitivethat has one major consumer group on edge the likelihood that there soon will be a flood of new information products on the market definitely heightens our concerns about personal privacy and accurate credit reports says pamela pressley a consumer advocate with the california public interest research group in los angelessome observers expect skilling and his financial backers boston investment funds bain capital inc and thomas h lee co also will make an aggressive effort to snap up other companiestheres a lot of consolidation going on in the information industry says john kutler president of quarterdeck investment partners in century city you get maximum leverage by finding new markets and the quickest way is to buy up smaller companies that are serving those marketstrw information itself was the product of an acquisition in  aerospace giant trw bought credit data corp a michiganbased credit reporting business that was one of the first in the industry to computerizethe unit grew rapidly but that came at a pricewhen skilling took over

store jobs homedirect marketing  printskillings laws skilling’s laws posted on march   by chief marketer staff van skilling has engineered some major deals and is good at playing the role of a buttoneddown ceo but he has another sidethat of a character in the american grain part of it has to do with the sheer length and variety of his career a native of st louis david van diest skilling known to all as van got out of college at the tail end of the korean war “i had a major in chemistry with the idea that i was going to be a doctor” he said during a chat in san francisco last fall “i was not sure i wanted to go to medical school but since i didn’t want to be drafted i became an oxymorona naval intelligence officer” in  having bounced from a boat business to a chemicals firm and from denver to los angeles he received an offer that would define his career “a friend of mine from navy days said ‘i have an idea’ i thought he wanted to open a laundromat why don’t i work for trw i said ‘you don’t pay your bills very well” trw was a large defense contractor and engineering concern and skilling worked in its oilfield equipment and industrial products groups in both marketing and operationswhatever they threw him in  he was given command of the information services unit consisting of a credit bureau and database business about which he knew little but he was a quick study and realized at once that the unit had to overhaul its outdated systems he also figured out that trw brass had never been comfortable with the information business and he told them “play me or trade me” they did in a  billion deal backed by bain capital and thomas lee associates the unit was renamed experian that was just the start as part of a twopronged strategy to be more global and get more involved in target marketing experian made an offer to buy ccn a british targeting company owned by great universal stores but it didn’t work out as planned “we went from being the groom to the bride” skilling laughed experian was acquired by ccngus then went on an acquisition bender of its own buying metromail and direct marketing technology among other things today experian is a true global enterprisethanks in large part to the tall silverhaired executive described by some as courtly skilling’s subordinates can be forgiven for being misty eyed over his retirement which is scheduled for march  never one to take himself too seriously he often amused them by reciting skilling’s laws such as “clear liquor before dinner red wine with dinner brown liquor after dinner” though he’ll stay active skilling hopes to to do some fly fishing and spend more time with his family memories to this day he is proud of one of the bright kids on his team “the only job bill gates ever had was working for me” he said “unfortunately we couldn’t keep him” more get content like this delivered to your inbox subscribe chief business marketer chief direct marketer chief promo marketer chief marketer tech
