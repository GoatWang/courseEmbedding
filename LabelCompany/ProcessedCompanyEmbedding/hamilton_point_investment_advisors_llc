us client portal home  the hp difference  faq the hp difference  faq the hamilton point difference because we are not affiliated with any banks brokerage firms or insurance companies hamilton point is able to focus exclusively on managing money and not on selling insurance annuities or other financial “products”  as a registered investment advisor our legal and fiduciary obligation is to put the interests of our clients first  the firm’s principals align their interests with those of their clients by “eating their own cooking” ie the firm’s principals manage their personal portfolios in the same fashion as hamilton point does for clients our boutique size and inhouse research allow us to be more selective than large financial institutions that control far more money than we believe can be invested with a highquality focus  this problem is often compounded by an excessive marketing and investment focus on benchmarks by industry participants   at hamilton point our foremost concern is the preservation of capital — not benchmarks  we also believe our hybrid approach which combines individuallypurchased securities with selective use of outside managers and funds is the best way to fulfill the investment objectives of our clients  hamilton point’s approach strives to maximize control over critical factors such as quality diversification expenses and if needed taxes we have built a strong reputation around our firm culture which emphasizes client service and interaction   clients are always serviced by investment professionals and during business hours calls are answered by a human being – not a machine  new clients come to our firm almost exclusively from referrals by current clients or professionals eg accountants and attorneys and we pride ourselves on developing close relationships with all of our clients  this growth through relationship building allows us to further strive to minimize expenses for clients since no “middleman” or salesperson is compensated who are your clients our clients are located in seventeen states with concentrations in north carolina virginia and new york and include high net worth families and nonprofit institutions among our clients are individuals who have sold businesses inherited assets andor saved money throughout successful careers our nonprofit clients look to us for advice in customizing an appropriate investment and spending policy that we implement using inhouse research to build high quality endowmentlike diversified portfolios who does your firm and its clients use for custodial trading and reporting services hamilton point’s custodial relationship with fidelity investment’s institutional wealth services group links clients with a partner providing service support and protection¹ investments you entrust for hamilton point’s management are typically placed in custody of fidelity’s clearing firm national financial services llc – one of the largest clearing providers in the industry fidelity investments is a privatelyowned firm founded in  with over  trillion in custodial assets our relationship with fidelity gives us access to portfolio trading tools and provides clients with userfriendly online access to their personal accounts clients can — and some do — direct us to use custodians other than fidelity  trades are done with fidelity and with outside brokerages when needed  fidelity does not impose an account custodial fee their compensation is primarily via commissionsfees earned on the account from trades initiated by hamilton point hamilton point also employs the services of advent software for client and account reporting what are the fees and expenses involved for portfolios of  or less   on the first  and  on the next   for portfolios of greater than  and less than or equal to  the fee is  on all assets  for portfolios of greater than  the fee is  on all assets many portfolios managed by hamilton point have exposure to selected mutual funds typically around  all of which are noload and have relatively low expenses  when evaluating fees it is important to ensure an appropriate “allin” expense ratio is reported when comparing advisors  we believe our utilization of inhouse research to individually purchase securities for a majority allocation in most client portfolios rather than using a pure “manager of managers” or “fund of funds” advisory approach allows us much greater control over expenses  we welcome the opportunity to review all expenses associated with a hamilton point managed account and compare them with the expenses of other investment options does your firm construct portfolios using individually purchased securities or mutual funds the answer is that in most cases we use both a fully diversified balanced account will consist primarily of individually purchased securities including corporate and treasury bonds up to forty global core stocks and up to thirty equity income stocks these individually purchased securities generally comprise  of a client portfolio and are selected based on inhouse research conducted by the firm’s investment team individually purchased securities are typically supplemented by appropriate exposure to selected asset classes using funds examples of asset classes accessed through the use of externallymanaged funds include inflationprotected bonds small capitalization equities and international equities for smaller accounts hamilton point may use funds exclusively in order to accomplish diversification objectives  hamilton point’s hybrid approach strives for greater control over quality expenses and if needed tax planning andor other customized client investment preferences what sort of client contact and reporting should clients expect for hamilton point listening to clients through regular interaction is a core value personal meetings are encouraged at least quarterly and more frequent communication is welcomed for daily account management and other inquiries each client is assigned a member of the investment committee as the primary relationship contact for reporting in addition to being able to view account activity on a daily basis online clients receive monthly

introductions with other tax and estate planning professionals as needed our goal is to help coordinate all aspects of each client’s financial picture including the components that we do not specifically manage as part of our investment services read more about our holistic approach to wealth management here how is performance measured and reported every client has a separate account or accounts managed on a customized basis for which we are able to provide performance on both a before and afterfee basis in addition we maintain a performance composite for each of our global core equity equity income diversified equity and balanced investment strategies  a performance composite is an aggregation of actual client portfolios which follow similar investment strategies objectives or mandates and is used to document the performance history of an investment strategy   strategy performance reported by hamilton point is from our composites and is never hypothetical back tested or simulated – a practice which we believe is too common and disingenuous  please contact us for more information do you have minimums relationships typically have the ability to be at least  million
