the nasdaq capital market and that it intends to voluntarily deregister its common stock under the securities exchange act of  the exchange act and cease filing reports with the securities and exchange commission the sec the decision to voluntarily delist and deregister the common stock is a cost savings step that will reduce expenses associated with the companys nasdaq listing and compliance with sec reporting requirements which include legal accounting and other administrative fees the companys common stock is thinly traded and the company does not believe the benefits of having its common stock listed and registered outweigh the burden of those annual costs management believes that the expense reductions created by delisting and deregistering the companys shares will benefit the company and its shareholders and ultimately will serve to maximize the value of the company the company anticipates that it will file with the sec a form  relating to the delisting of its

deregister its common stock pursuant to applicable exchange act rules and consequently cease filing reports with the sec the record date for the annual meeting was january   and the company filed a definitive proxy statement with the sec regarding the proposed reverse stock split on january   on the effective date of the delisting the company plans to file a form  to deregister its common shares under section g of the securities exchange act of  it will be eligible to delist and deregister because it will have fewer than  record holders of its common stock if the reverse stock split is approved by the companys stockholders and completed as proposed upon filing of the form  the companys obligation to file certain reports with the sec including forms k q and k will immediately be suspended the company expects that the deregistration of its common stock will become effective  days after the date of filing of the form  with the sec similar private companies by industry company
