tyson and jack corbett they are now a leader in sustainable investing launching with just over  in assets the firm now manages close to  billion primarily across its mutual fund products throughout global markets  b assets under management  founded in portsmouth nh asset classes equities equity options fixed income high yield the challenge pax world management manages close to  billion in assets spread across five equity and fixed income mutual funds four asset allocation funds two index funds and several separate accounts which are overseen by eight portfolio managers trading a variety of fixed income instruments in addition to domestic and international equities pax was looking for a system that could handle both the asset class scope and the compliance requirements surrounding the firms investment strategiesthis included finding a system capable of handling compliance needs pertaining to  act regulations  pax was also seeking a solution to help efficiently facilitate accurate settlement processes for their positions improvement on this settlement process has increased the accuracy of their positions and decreased manual reconciliation we were looking to find a system that could help alleviate the tedious costly and inefficient manual processes that our portfolio managers were performing said brian fruh vice president information technology for pax world management and perhaps more importantly we were looking for a service provider offering a support model that we could rely on we wanted a system that could help avoid costly and inefficient manual processes brian fruh vice president information technology pax world management llc the selection process eze software group was one of several providers considered by pax and ultimately was selected to help them manage their investment processes we really like how flexible the system is said fruh they gave us the best opportunity to simplify and automate many of our operational and trading processes another factor in our decision was their experience implementing and working with other traditional asset managers and mutual funds  furthermore the compliance capabilities of the oms allowed pax to ensure that they could focus on their core strategy of sustainable investing paxs proprietary esg screens were loaded into the oms compliance module and monitored on a pretrade and posttrade basis eze software offered us a robust compliance solution which was easily integrated into our investment workflows said john boese chief compliance officer for pax world management eze software gave us the best opportunity to simplify and automate many of our operational and trading processes brian fruh vice president information technology pax world management llc   solution  implementation the ezesoft consulting team spent considerable time with users at pax to provide onsite training ensuring their comfort with the system prior to going live pax now leverages eze software oms for everything from order entry and execution to portfolio modeling their portfolio managers have found the portfolio analytics and modeling capabilities to be extremely useful for checking positions modeling and sending the resulting trades to the blotter for execution tailoring the system to our business requirements during the implementation process was straightforward not only because of eze softwares technology but also due to their highly knowledgeable and experienced implementation and support teams said fruh additionally paxs proprietary esg screens have been integrated with eze software oms so that they can now easily create and maintain compliance rules designed to restrict their ability to trade those securities  tailoring the system to our business requirements during the implementation was straightforward brian fruh vice president information technology pax world management llc results the implementation from the pax perspective has been highly successful with their traders and pms managing their orders in the system comfortably from an operational standpoint we are simply more efficient now that many of our daily investment processes have been automated said fruh the automatic flow of accurate position data into the oms leaves the portfolio managers more time to focus on making accurate informed investment decisions with their settlement process now completely automated pax can focus their time and energy  on its core investment strategies so why does eze software group stand out compared to other technology vendors eze offered us the best combination of technology
