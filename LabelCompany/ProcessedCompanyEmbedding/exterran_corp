releases fourth quarter earnings diversified products and global reach are positives financial position is strong exterran releases fourth quarter earnings exterran corp nyseextn released fourth quarter earnings on thursday showing a net loss of  million for the houstonbased company created from a spinoff of archrock inc nysearoc in november  exterran currently has a market cap of  million with the recent quarter still affected by costs associated with that breakup despite the loss for the quarter the company still saw full year revenues for  of  billion which were  lower than  however the company sells products to the oil  gas industry so there was always going to be negatives in this report chief executive andrew way commented on the results saying though market conditions continue to be very challenging as a result of low commodity prices and industry activity levels we performed generally in line with our expectations during the fourth quarter in our service businesses gross margin was relatively stable and benefited from greater focus on operating efficiencies way continued capital projects continue to be delayed or cancelled and pricing pressures have intensified as customers navigate an uncertain nearterm outlook in this environment we will continue to focus on what we can control including resetting our cost structure in line with changing demand and generating free cash flow through efficient execution and working capital reductions my expectation is that we will emerge from this downturn with a strong balance sheet and a lean cost structure which will enable us to take advantage of our business operating leverage as growth returns diversified products and global reach are positives the comments from the ceo tell the real story for exterran amidst the earnings report this is a new company created through a spinoff which is undergoing price pressures from an industry in crisis yet is positioning itself well for an improvement in conditions two positives for exterran corp are the companys diversified product offerings and its global reach exterran is a market leader in compression production and processing products and services so despite being caught in the crossfire of the oil price slump there is scope to be creative with their strategy to position themselves towards areas of growth exterran has a base on the waterfront of singapore with the capability to build topside modules for fpsos and a range of subsea products whilst through its company belleli energy cpe exterran has the largest facility in europe for the manufacture of critical process equipment with  staff in  countries there is a geographic ability to react to demand for its full range of oil gas and water engineering and project management services financial position is strong the real strength for exterran inc is its strong financial position with a market cap of  million the full year eps of  per share gives a pe ratio around  margins in  were  for contracts  in aftermarket services and  in product sales for a total margin of  with the company able to reduce its cost of sales across its three product segments capital expenditures were relatively flat yearonyear at  million against  billion in revenues whilst longterm debt was half of shareholders equity with the spinoff completed late last year exterran will likely have more freedom to pursue its own goals and this could lead to further efficiencies across  and i like the recent comments from the ceo the real weight on the stock price of exterran is still the struggles of its customers and the current industry climate of sharp reductions in capital expenditures is not great for the future price of the stock despite this there are still reasons to see future growth for the company and if we see lower prices in the near future there is a real case for value based on spinoff freedom for the strategy and the companys ability to chase multiple markets in global locations the recent quarters loss of  million should be placed alongside the  million in restructuring costs for the year and full year revenues which were only down  in a tough year for oil  gas a drop in price following the recent earnings is an opportunity to get involved although i may hold off and see if we can get  which would create very favourable ratios to capitalize on future growth
