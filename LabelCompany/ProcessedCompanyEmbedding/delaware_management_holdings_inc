outlook an indepth perspective across global equities fixed income multiasset strategies and alternatives and real assets including insights from macquaries delaware investments the outlook titled the way forward outlines key investment themes across global asset classes as investors enter  stressing that worldwide economic and political uncertainty are likely to influence investors next year and could create volatility in many ways  was a year of the unexpected said shawn lytle president of delaware investments it was a time when unprecedented monetary policy did not fulfill the promise of economic stimulus and helped encourage the hunt for yield when equities continued their unpredictably long bull market run and when investments like infrastructure were suddenly thrust into the spotlight as all eyes have turned toward fiscal spending lytle added the global economic and markets balancing act which has dominated the investment environment since the  global financial crisis continues as the new year approaches slowing economic growth is a global phenomenon affecting investors worldwide while we may see slightly improved growth in gross domestic product gdp depending on factors such as fiscal policy development there also could well be more volatility in  following are a few highlights of the firms outlooks for specific asset classes global equities equity markets

to continue small incremental steps in monetary policy are possible around the globe with fiscal policy in the discussion political upheaval and protectionist trends are the key risks  particularly
