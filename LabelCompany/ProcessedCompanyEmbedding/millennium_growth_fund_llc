between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range

the fund gained  for the semiannual reporting period ending may   trailing the  return of the benchmark sp ® index portfolio manager john roth avoided tech giants he thought were overbought which hurt the fund as these stocks rallied this period includied was index component apple the funds largest individual detractor commodity prices declined the past six months which dragged on several of the funds energy investments including anadarko petroleum a texasbased exploration  production ep firm john tends to avoid the large energy multinationals such as exxon mobil in favor of energy firms operating in niche areas such as those exposed to us gas and infrastructure falling energy prices hurt exxon and not owning this index member was the funds largest individual contributor given what john considers the late stage of the market cycle and uncertainty surrounding future government economic policies he positioned the fund cautiously keeping some cash in reserve and limiting exposure to morecyclical investments qa an interview with portfolio manager john roth john how did the fund perform for the semiannual reporting period ending may   the fund rose  trailing the  return of the sp  benchmark for the same time frame the fund also lagged our peer group average the funds underperformance of the index was almost entirely due to its poor positioning among energy and information technology stocks we were significantly overweight energy which returned roughly  this period and underweight the strongperforming tech sector where stock selection further dragged on relative performance  looking further out the fund fell short of the benchmark and peer group average for the  months ending may  lets start with energy what was your approach and why didnt it pan out the past six months as i do across all market sectors i try to locate situations where i have a more positive view of a companys future prospects than the consensus within energy inventories remained stubbornly high while an acceleration of drilling has been concentrated on one area the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico the combination of both of these factors concerned investors conversely i continued to think the riskreward balance of owning energy names was still favorable it appeared as if were about halfway through the energy cycle and i believed global demand still had room to improve while the energy market may face some volatility during the remainder of  at period end i am more bullish on the sectors outlook ive positioned the fund in select energy names that i think stand to benefit from my positive outlook for the sector including those exposed to us natural gas and infrastructure as well as us producers of natural gas and oil unfortunately for the fund commodity prices declined the past six months which hurt several of our investments here including anadarko petroleum  an ep firm williams companies  which owns a majority stake in williams partners a north american pipeline owner and another fund holding multinational energy firm conocophillips  and denbury resources a nonindex ep that returned about  for the fund what techrelated names disappointed technology stocks rallied this period led by the socalled fangs – facebook amazon netflix and google through alphabet its parent company ecommerce giant amazon while not categorized as a tech name is a major player in data storage and cloud computing despite solid fundamentals for each of these firms i chose not to hold netflix and underweighted the other three names based on valuation concerns as i found all four stocks overbought this stance hurt particularly being underexposed to apple the funds biggest individual detractor the past six months apple shares rose  this period driven by betterthanexpected firstquarter sales for its iphone®  device along with excitement over its upcoming iphone  i further reduced the funds stake in apple this period as it appeared to me the market had priced in a super cycle for the iphone  avoiding amazon  and underweighting alphabet  also significantly dampened relative results where did you find success looking at individual names the funds toptwo relative contributors were largecap index components i chose not to own energy giant exxon mobil and multinational conglomerate general electric ge i tend to avoid the large energy multinationals such as exxon in favor of firms i find more interesting such as those exposed to us gas and infrastructure exxon shares returned  hurt by falling energy prices making our zero weighting in exxon our largest individual contributor this period meanwhile ge did not look attractive to me due to its cyclical exposure and valuation avoiding ge was a plus as its shares began to fall in january after the firm reported disappointing quarterly financials despite better firstquarter results the stock fell in april when investors became concerned about some of ges industrial businesses and its cash outflow ge rode a volatile path for the remainder of the period and the stock returned  for the full six months elsewhere my choices within health care also were additive here longtime fund holding and medical device maker boston scientific was a big contributor the stock gained  on consecutive quarters of betterthananticipated financial results in addition in march the firm announced plans to acquire symetis a switzerlandbased maker of implantable heart valves in an effort to bolster its product lineup in the heartvalvereplacement market in may boston scientific reported positive results from a trial for its alair™ treatment for asthma  john how is the fund positioned nowas of period end i think its a bit of a tricky time to gauge the future weve had a long run in the markets recovery and as time passes the potential for fiscal stimulus appears less and less likely while i still am finding areas that look interesting to me – including businesses within the energy services industry and those with recurring revenues – ive maintained a sense of caution in terms of the funds positioning im keeping some cash in reserve – about  at period end – and limiting the funds exposure to morecyclical investments ■ john roth on the housing industry the market has notched some impressive gains this past year but i think its important to maintain perspective on where we are in the market cycle particularly when it comes to consumeroriented investments looking at the macroeconomic picture consumer confidence is near an alltime high – surpassing even what we saw in  – and unemployment is low curiously though consumer spending has stayed relatively anemic indicating to me a disconnect between consumer confidence and where people are deciding to spend their money that said the automotive industry recently enjoyed record sales though i think that cycle likely has peaked in my view this mixed data suggests its important to maintain caution when it comes to consumer stocks however i am bullish on opportunities im finding in the housing industry median home prices have recovered from their postfinancialcrisis low – which bodes well for consumers balance sheets as well as their credit importantly new construction has been slow to recover in the past  years and is still not anywhere near peak i also view the industrys supply and demand balance as fair at period end the fund is invested in select housing names i think have the potential to grow against this backdrop one such fund investment is in dr horton the largest homeconstruction company in the united states in my view the firm has been prudent with its capital during the market recovery executing its business well and avoiding many of the mistakes made by others during the last housing cycle in addition dr horton has been proactive about bringing innovative products to market including its freedom line of affordable homes for seniors in agerestricted communities market recap the us equity bellwether sp ® index returned  for the six months ending may   displaying a strong rampup during the first half of the period on optimism for president trumps
