second quarter  earnings conference call my name is liz and i will be your conference operator today i would now like to turn the call over to sung lee vice president of investor relations please go ahead sung lee  gilead sciences inc thank you liz and good afternoon everyone just after market close today we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter  the press release and detailed slides are available on the investor relations section of the gilead website the speakers on todays call will be robin washington executive vice president and chief financial officer kevin young chief operating officer norbert bischofberger executive vice president of research and development and chief scientific officer and john milligan president and chief executive officer before we begin formal remarks let me remind you that we will be making forwardlooking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products product candidates financial projections and the use of capital all of which involve certain assumptions risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements a description of these risks can be found in the latest sec disclosure documents and recent press releases in addition gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements made during this call nongaap financial measures will be used to help you understand the companys underlying business performance the gaap to nongaap reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well is on the gilead website i will now turn the call over to robin robin l washington  gilead sciences inc thank you sung and good afternoon everyone we are pleased to provide you with an update for our second quarter ill review the financial results kevin will address the commercial performance norbert will highlight the progress made in rd and then john will make a few closing comments our strong performance in the second quarter was driven by a continuation of the positive trends in our nonhcv business and better than expected results from our hcv business particularly in the us total revenues for the second quarter were  billion with nongaap diluted earnings per share of  this compares to revenues of  billion and nongaap earnings per share of  for the same period last year product sales for the second quarter were  billion down  yearoveryear and up  sequentially the yearoveryear decline was due to lower hcv sales partially offset by increased sales in hiv and other therapeutic areas sequentially hcv sales grew  and hiv and other therapeutic area sales grew  turning to the us product sales for the second quarter were  billion up  yearoveryear driven by favorable demand for our nonhcv products offset by lower hcv sales and up  sequentially primarily due to the continued strong uptake of our taf franchise and favorable inventory movements for hiv and hcv turning to europe product sales for the second quarter were  billion down  yearoveryear and up  sequentially the yearoveryear decline was primarily due to competitive dynamics in hcv and unfavorable currency movements the sequential increase was primarily due to the onetime recognition of deferred revenue related to an hcv contract demand for epclusa and the continued uptake of our tafbased regimens kevin will provide more color for the us as well as the other regions now turning to expenses nongaap rd expenses were  million for the second quarter down  compared to the same period last year due primarily to the purchase of an fda priority review voucher in  nongaap sga expenses were  million for the second quarter compared to  million in the same period last year we remain focused on operating in a highly efficient manner and are proactively managing expenses and investing in areas of strategic importance to generate industryleading operating margins significant cash flows and a strong balance sheet we ended the quarter with  billion in cash and investments and generated cash flows from operations of  billion while we anticipate strong cash flows in the second half of  we expect a sequential decrease in the second half of the year as we anticipate large cash payments for government rebates both in the us and abroad as well as other seasonal payments as part of our plan to return capital to our shareholders we paid cash dividends of  million and repurchased  million shares of stock for  million to offset dilution in the second quarter we continue to prioritize the use of capital for investing in the longterm growth of our business including partnerships and acquisitions finally i would like to update our fullyear  guidance provided to you on may  and summarized on slide  in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website we are increasing net product sales to a range of  billion to  billion nonhcv net product sales are expected to be in the range of  billion to  billion hcv net product sales are expected to be in the range of  billion to  billion this guidance reflects the strong performance we have seen in the first half of  across our businesses specifically in the us while continuing to anticipate increased competitive dynamics in the us and eu during the second half of the year this guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are highlighted on slide  in the earnings results presentation including the accuracy of our estimates for hcv patient starts for the remainder of  unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors resulting in lower than anticipated market share in hcv and lower than expected market share and greater price erosion as the result of the introduction of generic versions of tdf and the fixeddose combination of ftctdf outside the us we are narrowing the rd expense guidance to a range of  billion to  billion we are also narrowing the sga expense guidance to a range of  billion to  billion finally the diluted earnings per share impact of gaap to nongaap adjustments is expected to be in the range of  to  all other components of our guidance remain unchanged i would now turn the call over to kevin to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter kevin b young  gilead sciences inc thank you robin and good afternoon everyone we continue to see strong uptake of our tafbased regimens in the united states and europe in the us total hiv and hbv revenues were  billion for the quarter up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially these results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our hiv franchise at the end of june our tafbased regimens accounted for  of gileads total hiv prescription volume leading the way was genvoya with a treatmentnaïve patient share of  more than twice that of the secondmost prescribed therapy this represents the highest treatmentnaïve patient share for a single product or regimen since the early days of atripla in addition more than one third of patients who switch hiv therapy now switch to genvoya more broadly gilead single tablet regimens represented four of the top five most prescribed products across all categories treatmentnaïve switch and total treated patients beyond taf truvada for prep continues to be an important option when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent hiv transmission we estimate that approximately  people in the us were using truvada for prep as we exited the second quarter we are also encouraged to see thirdparty providers announcing new initiatives on broadening access to prep turning to europe total hiv and hbv revenues were  million in the second quarter down  yearoveryear and up  sequentially the yearoveryear decrease was driven by negative foreign exchange the sequential increase was due to robust demand for our hiv therapies strong uptake of our taf franchise continues throughout europe based on preliminary data for the second quarter genvoya is expected to be the most prescribed therapy for both treatmentnaïve and switch patients across the top five european markets collectively im delighted to say that in france the largest hiv market in europe genvoya became the most prescribed hiv regimen for treatmentnaïve and switch patients just four months after launch turning to descovy and odefsey we now have these products available in  and  european countries respectively additional launches are anticipated in  as pricing and reimbursement discussions continue guidelines have a significant impact on prescribing patterns following the recent inclusion in france genvoya is now a preferred regimen in country guidelines in all five of the major european markets turning to hcv total revenues in the us were  billion in the second quarter down  yearoveryear and up  sequentially the quarteronquarter increase was primarily due to a change in inventory and the timing of patient starts our market share for the quarter remained high at approximately  hcv patient starts in the first six months were better than we originally anticipated as a result while we still expect a gradual decline over the second half of the year we estimate total us market starts to be  to  for  approximately  million individuals were tested for hcv in  a  increase from  as you may recall we launched an educational campaign in october of last year to encourage baby boomers to get tested our research shows that there has been an  increase in hcv antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative as testing has increased so has diagnosis approximately  people were newly diagnosed with hcv in  a  increase from  this reinforces our belief that there is a significant opportunity to treat and cure many hcv infected individuals for years to come gilead is committed to raising disease awareness and urging all individuals at risk for or living with hcv to talk to their health care provider turning to europe total hcv revenue in the second quarter was  million down  yearoveryear and up  from the previous quarter as robin mentioned the quarteronquarter increase was due to the onetime recognition of a deferred revenue related to an hcv contract gilead patient starts were approximately  for the quarter as declining trends in early launch countries were offset by the opening of access in other markets with the addition of france italy and spain earlier this year all five major european markets have now agreed to expand access to patients regardless of fibrosis score this means that there are now  european countries that allow patient access regardless of disease severity we are seeing rapid uptake of epclusa mirroring the same success we had some nine months ago in the us epclusa is quickly becoming the standard of care for hcv patients with genotypes  and  and reimbursement has been achieved in  countries while many people have been diagnosed with hcv and cured there remain millions of people infected with hcv throughout europe in germany there are over  people estimated to be infected with hcv who are unaware that they have the disease in partnership with the german liver foundation gilead has launched its first large multichannel disease awareness campaign to communicate that hcv can affect anyone and encourage all individuals at risk to talk to their health care provider looking to the second half of  and with the launch of vosevi we believe that gilead has the most comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the needs of almost all hepatitis c patients regardless of disease severity regardless of genotype and regardless of prior treatment finally as i highlighted last quarter our us cardiopulmonary team is delivering consistently impressive results they embody the same tenets of operational excellence as our hiv and liver teams letairis and ranexa revenue total  million for the quarter i would now like to turn the call over to norbert norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc thank you kevin earlier this week we announced the exciting results presented at the ias meeting in paris from two phase  studies studies  and  evaluating a fixed dose combination of bftaf compared to the tripletherapy regimens containing dolutegravir among treatmentnaïve patients in study  adults with hiv were randomized to receive bftaf or the fixeddose combination of abacavir dolutegravir lamivudine and in study  adults with hiv were randomized to receive bftaf or dolutegravir plus ftaf in both studies bftaf met its primary objective of noninferiority as defined by the proportion of patients who achieved biological suppression there was no treatmentemerging resistance through  weeks bftaf was well tolerated and no patients discontinued study medication due to renal events in either study additionally no new safety signals were observed and the nature and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was similar among treatment groups with the exception of nausea in study  which occurred with higher frequency in the abacavirdolutegravirlamivudine arm it was also reported at the conference that in study  there were more patient selfreported neurological and constitutional adverse events in the abacavirdolutegravirlamivudine arm these results reinforce the value of pairing bictegravir an unboosted integrase inhibitor with a high barrier to resistance with the demonstrated longterm safety profile of the ftaf backbone addressing the limitations of current hiv therapy bftaf could represent an important advance in the tripletherapy treatment for a broad range of hiv patients including the aging population and those with mild to moderate renal impairment last month gilead filed a new drug application for bftaf with the us food and drug administration based on data from studies  and  and two other ongoing studies evaluating the singletablet regimen in virologically suppressed patients in both these studies patients were randomized to either switch to bftaf or remain on their existing regimen which in one study is a tripletherapy regimen containing abacavirdolutegravirlamivudine and the other study a regimen of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor we plan to present data from these studies at scientific meetings later this year in addition to these four studies we have one other study ongoing where patients on dolutegravir and descovy are randomized to stay on that regimen or switch to bftaf in the european union gileads marketing authorization application for bftaf was fully validated earlier this month and is now under evaluation by the european medicines agency with regards to hiv prevention research were pleased to report that the discover trial is now fully enrolled ahead of schedule with more than  participants across north america and europe the discover study randomized patients to receive truvada or descovy to evaluate whether descovy is safe and effective at reducing the risk of hiv infection when used as a preexposure prophylaxis turning to nash two phase  trials stellar  and stellar  are underway evaluating selonsertib which is our ask inhibitor in patients with f bridging fibrosis and f cirrhosis enrollment in these studies is going well and since initiating the studies in march of this year we have already screened more than  patients were confident that these studies will be fully enrolled in the first half of  recall that in a phase  study selonsertib was shown to reverse fibrosis and decrease fibrosis progression in a dosedependent manner additionally two other compounds with different mechanisms of action an acc inhibitor gs and an fxr agonist gs are currently in phase  with data readouts anticipated in the second half of this year were also exploring combinations of the three agents in phase a studies in oncology a phase  study of andecaliximab which is our antimmp antibody in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing and interim futility analysis from this study will be conducted later this year in addition the phase a study has been initiated to evaluate combinations of our btk inhibitor tirabrutinib with our pik inhibitor idelalisib and our syk inhibitor entospletinib in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed refractory cll were also evaluating entospletinib in a phase  study in acute myeloid leukemia in inflammation five phase  studies of filgotinib are ongoing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ulcerative colitis and crohns disease we plan to initiate a phase  study with filgotinib in combination with gs a syk inhibitor in summary significant progress has been made with many of our programs four molecules are continuing in phase  including the descovy for prep selonsertib for nash filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis ulcerative colitis and crohns disease and we expect to see a number of regulatory and clinical milestones in the second half of this year i would now like to turn over the call to john john f milligan  gilead sciences inc thanks norbert im going to keep my remarks brief so we can get your questions i do want to emphasize the importance of norberts comment a few moments ago weve made tremendous strides with antiretroviral therapy over the past two decades but still today every treatment option available has some compromise be that a food requirement the risk of side effects tolerability the emergence of viral resistance or a potential interaction with another medication those tradeoffs and compromises that people living with hiv and their healthcare providers have to make may be minimized to perhaps the greatest extent possible with bftaf this is why were so encouraged by the data presented at the ias conference in paris this week and by the data in patients switching from other hiv medications that will be presented at scientific meetings later this year id also like to take this time to congratulate our partner janssen for the positive chmp opinion on symtuza a singletablet regimen containing darunavir cobicistat emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide or taf when approved by the european commission symtuza will be the first commercially available str containing a protease inhibitor an important option for patients who previously had to consume two or more tablets every day turning to hcv last month the chmp issued a positive opinion on gileads application for marketing authorization for vosevi then just last week the us fda approved vosevi for the treatment of hcv genotypes  through  in patients who virus rebounded during or after treatment with an nsa inhibitor and in patients with genotypes a and  who have been previously treated with a sofosbuvircontaining regimen the approval is three weeks ahead of the pdufa date and marks gileads fourth hcv therapy approval in threeandahalf years we commenced our launch plan immediately upon notification by fda bottles of vosevi were shipped to wholesalers last week and it is now available in pharmacies we are aware that prescriptions were written within hours of the approval and are pleased that many patients who have run out of options and are worried about the progression of their liver disease will now have another chance to be cured of their hcv infection we had a strong second quarter and as you heard from norbert our pipeline is growing and maturing in hiv nash inflammatory diseases and oncology we are looking ahead to a number of exciting clinical milestones in the second half of this year and the continued progression of the bftaf regulatory review in the us europe and other countries i want to take this opportunity to thank gileads  employees for the incredible focus hard work and execution over the first half of this year in the interest of time lets now open the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of geoff meacham with barclays geoff meacham  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter got one for kevin or norbert so the genvoya launch continues to look really really good but i wanted to know now that you have the bictegravir data in hand one how are you thinking about positioning relative to genvoya and two is there enough differentiation versus dolutegravir to take share that you didnt get with genvoya thanks kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hey geoff thank you for the question i should say straightaway that not in the room today is jim meyers our executive vice president for commercial operations because actually jim has been in paris these last few days hes heading back today and he certainly relayed to us the excitement around bicftaf weve had several key opinion leader advisory boards and i think the data that weve presented them from the first two studies have been exceedingly well received having said that geoff weve made a flying start with genvoya i dont think we could be happier as i said in my script over half of our patients are now tafbased in the us and we have a range of different conversions in europe but somewhere like germany it was our first country is now upwards of  so were thrilled with the adoption of genvoya not only that descovy and odefsey and as i think ive said in the past the success of bicftaf is on the platform of the adoption of descovybased regimens so we consider this a total family were still really excited about bicftaf nothing has changed the data is reinforced so we got tremendous product its a beautiful small pill and we think it can be very strongly additive to our ftaf portfolio of drugs so as far as were concerned were now going to be moving to very high gear for the launch of that new regimen come  norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc yeah geoff you asked about differentiation from dolutegravir if you look at the results from study  the two so comparing dolutegravir ftaf to bftaf the two drugs are virologically identical adverse events laboratory abnormalities are the same the real differentiation is we have one single pill coformulated one copay one pill thats the big differentiation from dolutegravir geoff meacham  barclays capital inc okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from matthew harrison with morgan stanley matthew k harrison  morgan stanley  co llc so thanks thanks very much i was on mute for a second there i guess if i could ask you called out i guess the broad question here is around what youre seeing in the hcv market and sort of sustainability of the revenues that youve talked about and related to that could you just comment i think you called out a couple onetime items but you didnt disclose the size of the inventory or the size of the x tenants  if youd be willing to just – if youre not willing to disclose that number could you just give us an idea of the relative size of those that would be helpful thanks kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hey matthew its kevin ill kick off and then robin can add to my comments were very pleased that there is this increased number of patients that have started in the first half of the year i think naturally we were careful and sensitive in going into  a cure market has surprises on the way up and it certainly surprises on the way down so i think we took a very careful approach to what might happen in  it is clear that more patients are starting than we had predicted in our guidance and as i said in my opening remarks we now think its going to be in the range of  to  patients so clearly thats very positive the other thing i would say is my comments on identifying hcvinfected individuals if you think about it as were treating and curing patients we want to make sure that the patients infected are coming into the system albeit that they generally seem to be less ill than they were a few years ago but its important to still keep the movement of patients coming through and as i said we still consider this a large market a very important market for gilead albeit that we still think there is a gradual trend down and where that sort of turns the corner or bottoms out right now still remains to be seen robin l washington  gilead sciences inc hi matt and to answer the other part of your question the specific items that we called out so on hcv in the us we did talk about inventory and i would say that trend is not any different than what weve typically seen in hiv i think wed not called them out in the past because we typically had other changes that somewhat masked them but with a sequential change or with a sequential kind of stabilization of pricing as well as patient starts and market share that shift in inventory is just more noticeable but the same ima agreements are in place for hiv exists that the ranges for our overall inventory were maintained quarteronquarter and keep in mind with the epclusa launch last fall just that ongoing volatility until you get to steady state is what we see the dynamics impacting us where we had kind of an inventory build here given inventory adjustments the last couple of quarters i just want to emphasize that despite the inventory change that the real underlying driver is just what kevin talked about in the us its really increased patient starts and so the inventory change was just one component of the overperformance in eu the other area we called out was the onetime deferred revenue recognition from a volumebased contract agreement that we had in italy that expired so we had been recognizing revenue a little conservative todate and so we had a catchup onetime adjustment if you take that out the hcv revenue for europe sequentially would been about flat matthew k harrison  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks very much operator our next question comes from geoff porges with leerink partners geoffrey c porges  leerink partners llc thanks very much two very quick questions i apologize but could you robin could you let us know when we should anticipate the first generic truvada in the us given your agreement with teva at least can we anticipate that it wont be in the next  months and secondly norbert im sure youve looked very hard at the filgotinib clinical experience todate and could you comment on whether youve seen any thromboembolic events any imbalance in such events or whether you believe in any way its related to jak kinase inhibition john f milligan  gilead sciences inc so specifically to the first question geoff its john milligan with regard to generic truvada we dont expect generic truvada in the united states until  geoffrey c porges  leerink partners llc okay thanks thats very helpful norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc yes geoff we have looked of course at our database since the news was announced by lilly and incyte and we have found a total of three thromboembolic events this is by the way in a database of  patient years of experience one of the events was by the investigator said not related to the study drug because it was recurrent this was pulmonary embolism one of them was unlikely and one of them was possible so its really a small number and as you also know thrombolic events inflammatory conditions in general are not unusual but i would like to point out we are in our filgotinib study i think we have derisked the program by pursuing two doses this is something that fda asked us to do we agreed and so if there should be a difference between the two doses we will see it geoff i would like to add another quick – this is more speculation and hypothesis if you believe that these events that lilly saw are drugrelated so thats of course a big question because they saw a total of five geoffrey c porges  leerink partners llc yes norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc the second is if you then believe that they have to do with high platelet numbers this then all kind of makes sense because baricitinib makes platelets go up filgotinib in contrast shows a platelet decrease so if this is real and if this is the mechanism then we should not be seeing this again this is somewhat speculative and hypothesis geoffrey c porges  leerink partners llc thanks very much for the two questions operator our next question comes from alethia young with credit suisse alethia young  credit suisse securities usa llc hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very solid quarter i guess kevin i just want to dig a little bit more into the trends were seeing in europe i saw that genvoya rose up to the top position in naïves and i guess i just want to know a little bit more under the hood of whats driving the dynamics there in europe for hiv thanks kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hi alethia thank you for the comments yeah were delighted with the quarter i think it was just all round solid across regions all our products are i also salute norbert for some incredible milestones on the rd front so were really pleased with where we are as a company in the middle of the year yes genvoya is now starting to exhibit across the countries the same performance that we are having in the us the extreme of that is germany were having very good uptake in spain and italy and of course as i highlighted france has done extraordinarily well just in four months to become the leading naïve and switch product the other thing i should say alethia is that descovy in itself is doing very very well in europe there are one or two markets that dont have the level of strs that we have here in the united states if you take somewhere like germany so descovy itself is doing very well and were happy to have that switch from truvada to descovy because its a great platform for bftaf in the future so i think were very pleased to be where we are and i only see great momentum across the european countries operator our next question comes from brian skorney with robert baird brian p skorney  robert w baird  co inc hey good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question john i know if i asked you what company youre going to buy youd tell me but i think the market should keep guessing so im going to ask something else the new diagnosis rates in hcv are pretty impressive but i wonder if you could characterize the trends youre seeing in access in the us and maybe provide some characterization of what type of patients are being diagnosed it never seemed like actual patient diagnosed volume is an issue so are these patients that are being diagnosed or do you think that are accessible from the current payer situation and is the payer situation improving from your point of view kevin b young  gilead sciences inc maybe brian i could start with that were not seeing a great deal of change pretty much the patients are if you like settling down they are naïve to therapy lower fibrosis scores generally we have about the same access that we had in terms of start of the year so there has not been any big fundamental changes i think there are still a proportion of patients somewhere in the region of  to  who do get diagnosed with quite advanced disease but on a general basis they are fitter than the established patients that were there in doctors offices and have been sat there for a long time waiting for a new treatment so thats kind of bad newsgood news because we do eventually believe that they will come through the system and make this a longterm market for us brian p skorney  robert w baird  co inc i think my question was just really meant more around the new patients are – i mean are we looking at the spike in patients are these patients that are diagnosed who are incarcerated or is it heterogeneous and kind of the standard so i want to know is the spike in new diagnosis is it actually going to pay off or is it in a patient population thats more or less inaccessible to branded products right now john f milligan  gilead sciences inc brian most of the folks who are seeking diagnosis are people who have access to very very good medical care this is not about incarceration the rate of treatment of incarcerated individuals is still exceedingly low in this country something that were focusing on but have had very little traction on so people who were seeking essentially the baby boomers who were seeking typically have very good healthcare or medicare brian p skorney  robert w baird  co inc okay thanks john f milligan  gilead sciences inc and so this a very good accessible population operator our next question comes from robyn karnauskas with citibank robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc hi guys thanks for taking my question maybe we could just followup and ask a little bit more about whats going on in the hiv market and who is switching who is not switching to these new therapies in the united states and what percentage of switch is coming from triumeq or tivicay regimens kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hi robyn nice to hear your voice again congratulations on i think the addition to your family robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc thank you kevin b young  gilead sciences inc so great to have you back really the results are very positive across the board as i said about  of switches come to genvoya when you start to break down the rest of it it tends to be kind of a mishmash a whole bunch of other switches in terms of your question about how much of genvoya comes from nongilead regimens thats just over thats  to  and thats stayed fairly constant since we launched genvoya so thats all additive to us its very positive and i think that will probably stay about where it is so i wouldnt say theres any particular new dynamics the switch continues to be the biggest part of the hiv market and genvoya is clearly leading the products in the goto switch regimen overall i think were just absolutely delighted that physicians see the benefit of having their patients on longterm tafbased regimens good for the suppression of hiv and obviously good for their kidneys and good for the bones robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc and as a follow up do you think theres anyone – do you have a sense yet that theres a percentage of people that you will not be able to switch or when do you think youll have a good sense of maybe a part of the market that will not be switching to these new therapies will it take the launch of the ftaf for you to understand that or do you think you kind of have a sense of that right now kevin b young  gilead sciences inc well we do hope genvoya is going to keep going up until we bring in the ftaf in  robin there are certain patients who are just very familiar with their therapies i dare say theres still going to be some atripla patients stribild patients complera patients theyre just comfortable even after discussion with their physician sometimes patients dont want to switch and also dont forget youve got a smaller proportion of patients who are on the pi regimens and sometimes physicians who feel that they perhaps might not be quite as adherent prefer them to be on a pibased regimen so there may not be the patients who come across robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc thank you operator our next question comes from cory kasimov with jpmorgan cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc hey good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question wanted to go back to hiv again in some of the doublet data that was presented at ias there was a very small subset of patients that experienced resistance mutations secondary to extreme nonadherence im curious as to your views on this and whether you think its a meaningful finding or just noise thanks norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc yes cory thanks for the question its norbert theres no doubt that both dolutegravir and tc are proven longterm tolerable and safe drugs the question that everybody has are the two by themselves enough to chronically suppress virus replication in a broad patient population irrespective of baseline viral load and irrespective of partial adherence and i think the data that were presented at ias actg  has put that into doubt even though these patients were nonadherent the one especially that developed the  mutation the fact is this is real life these patients do exist not all patients are adherent all the time and we just have to wait for longterm twoyear data to really answer this question by the way if you look at the detailed slides there were actually five patients that had virological failure if you use the fda definition of greater than  copies per ml at week  and it was at week  analysis so again we need to see more data and i know that the phase  studies are ongoing the gemini studies and hopefully well get the answer from that but as i said at this point i have great doubts whether that dolutegravirtc is enough to cover a broad patient population kevin b young  gilead sciences inc cory its kevin here if you get virological failure and resistance in a controlled clinical setting in a study then i dont know what might happen in real life its important to say that with the large numbers of hiv patients that are treated these days many have quite chaotic personal lives in terms of housing and the need for social care and they are very challenged and i think its important that those type of patients really do get robust therapies that do our very best to avoid them getting into difficult situations of failure cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc all right great thank you operator our next question comes from ying huang with bank of america merrill lynch ying huang  bank of america merrill lynch hey good afternoon thanks for taking my questions maybe first one for norbert we heard from some physicians attending ias this week that theres a small but potentially meaningful difference in cns studies such as sleep quality or disturbance or insomnia how meaningful is that in the real practice do you think that you can make a differentiation between bictegravir and the tivicay or triumeq regimen and then secondly maybe for kevin were expecting abbvie to obtain fda approval probably this quarter for their oncedaily one pill regimen for hcv whats the outlook for market share and also the pricing dynamics once abbvie enters the market with another one pill oncedaily regimen for hcv thank you norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc yes so ying in study  which was the trial mate to bictegravir bftaf comparison there were clearly more adverse selfreported adverse events that had to do with sleep disturbance nausea et cetera on the abacavircontaining arm but in the second study  the incidence was similar so our interpretation is that what we are seeing in terms of cnsrelated effects and constitutional general well being has to do with abacavir the comparison of bictegravir to dolutegravir did not really show a difference and i cannot at this point tell you what bictegravir does in terms of cns side effects kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hey ying its kevin in answer to your question we just dont know were just sort of two weeks before their fda pdufa date well just have to cross some bridges when we see their label we see their pricing we see how they begin to promote the product perhaps eventually see how they come on the market with their contracting strategies so i think there are unknowns and well just have to wait and see i can only really control the areas that we have with our products and i think we feel reassured by the portfolio of hcv products now we have vosevi added to that i think we have a tremendous offering in genotype   and  epclusa as robin mentioned is doing really really well both here and now its coming onstream in europe and well be able to also help the small number of patients who failed other therapies with vosevi so i think were in a good position and were certainly going to continue with our very solid and very substantial promotion of our products norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc ying i would like to add if you look at the data on  they had excellent clinical results in genotype  in treatmentnaïve very early disease mostly f and f actually  of the population was f and f and in treatmentnaïve patients but the data in the other genotypes and also in treatmentexperienced and cirrhotic patients were less good particularly if you look at genotype  where they compared in eight weeks to  weeks to  weeks of sofosbuvirdaclatasvir the regimen that had the most virological failures was the eight weeks of the abbvie dual followed by the  weeks of the abbvie dual and the bestperforming regimen was actually sofosbuvirdaclatasvir so as kevin said we just have to really look at what the us label will look like then we will be in a better position to comment on the competitive nature ying huang  bank of america merrill lynch thats very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from michael yee with jefferies michael j yee  jefferies llc hey good afternoon thanks i have two rd questions one is on filgotinib where you mentioned there was an interim analysis in uc in the first half of  can you just remind us a bit on that and what the importance is of that in terms of that interim and then secondly on fxr you have a phase  coming up soon in pbc i wanted to understand your confidence in terms of efficacy and differentiation and what you would want to see to move forward in nash thanks norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc yeah thank you michael no the interim analysis was not on filgotinib it was on the mmp antibody andecaliximab and that interim analysis is an analysis when we will have reached  of the endpoints and the endpoint is death so its overall survival and that will happen later this year and we have a hazard ratio prespecified so its more a futility analysis if we dont reach a minimal hazard ratio then we will probably discontinue the study but if the dsmb sees that has a ratio reached they will simply recommended to continue the study and the second question michael j yee  jefferies llc maybe im just reading it wrong on slide  and so ill follow up with you on the top there it says filgotinib phase  uc interim but well keep going norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc okay yes well follow up with you afterwards i dont have slide  and the other question had is about fxr agonist in pbc we just have to see what the data looks like but as you know or may know we are differentiated in terms of mechanism because we rely on intestinally generated fgf to essentially give you the efficacy and we think some the side effects that have been seen with the other fxr agonist may have to do with systemic fxr agonism its all hypothesis and the initial data that we have would actually support it but if we were to see this we could have an agent that is differentiated from a safety point of view and the other thing you may probably also know the compound thats approved currently has pretty severe limitations with regards to hepatic impairment i think it has to be given is it once a week i dont remember but it greatly increases the concentration of oca so those are the two areas of differentiation michael j yee  jefferies llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from phil nadeau with cowen and company phil nadeau  cowen  co llc good afternoon thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the beat and raise in the quarter one question on bictegravirs data that was presented earlier this week when gsk was asked about bictegravir this morning they highlighted the numeric differences in virologic suppression that were seeing in study  although those differences werent statistically significant i guess along those lines one to what to do you attribute those differences two how successful do you think youll be in convincing physicians that they are not significant using things like the missing excluded analysis that you showed in the poster and three do you even expect them to be on the label norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc sure so phil this is actually very simple you can have virological failure there are three categories that fall into it number one you come in at the week  visit and you truly have above  copies per ml thats one virological failure the second is if you discontinue and the physician indicates on the discontinuation form that youve discontinued for the lack of efficacy thats number two and the third category is if you have discontinued at any point in time for administrative reason and your last measurement was greater than  and now look at that third category we had a total of  patients on the bictegravir arm versus three on the dolutegravir arm that discontinued due to administrative reason and out of those  by the way six only showed up at the first visit so they showed up first visit took the drug and then we never saw them again and the reason was various they moved out of the area they couldnt be reached anymore they were incarcerated things like that so we think this is a completely a nonissue and we will have no problems at all convincing physicians that this doesnt matter these numbers will be in the label absolutely this is how fda in all hiv drugs in all phase  data categorizes thing but it will be categorized exactly this virological failure due to number one two virological failure discontinued due to lack of efficacy and number three and thats the category i want to point your attention to discontinued for other reasons and last measurement was greater than  kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hey phil its kevin just to also add the real – the number one headline that is most important to opinion leaders and therefore the hiv community is zero resistance when we have met with our kols that is where they go to first its zero resistance and of course that is unlike the situation that occurred in actg  norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc yes phil just another comment you would of course expect in a large study like this that these random events would equally distribute between the two arms well they didnt as i said there were  on the bictegravir arm versus three on the other arm its purely statistical coincidence and it has no meaning whatsoever clinically phil nadeau  cowen  co llc got it thats very helpful thanks for taking my question operator our next question comes from terence flynn with goldman sachs terence flynn phd  goldman sachs  co llc hi thanks for taking the question just was wondering john if you can give us any update on your latest thoughts on business development specifically if there have been any changes with respect to either areas of focus or stage of development thanks a lot john f milligan  gilead sciences inc thanks terence so the quick answer is no there hasnt been any difference in what were thinking about so we have been very very active as we always are we have beefed up our groups as youre aware so that we can evaluate more different kinds of opportunities and so we are working very hard behind the scenes here on a number of things but i certainly cant direct you to anything specific other than to say that were very very active and when the things are right for us well announce them thats all i can say operator our next question comes from ian somaiya with bmo capital markets m ian somaiya  bmo capital markets united states thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter really just a question on the prep opportunity if you could just quantify for us what the opportunity is today whether its in patient terms or dollar terms and as we think about the discover study what does that trial need to show for you to effectively transition these patients from truvada to descovy kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hi ian its kevin ill let norbert answer the question on the discover study but in terms just generally compared to the few years ago its quite remarkable now how people are taking on board the benefits of prep and obviously avoiding infection weve seen some remarkable work here in san francisco we see a lot of activity in new york miami and we have taken those signals and put a larger fieldbased team out there to try and support the education around prep so were able to visit places now like atlanta washington dc and many other urban areas about half of our truvada sales in the us are currently coming from prep and we certainly expect that to grow if you look at our numbers this year compared to  were about  higher in terms of the use of truvada for prep and the other part of this is its not occasional monthly use of truvada were starting to see persistency at a patient level that is close to matching normal hiv use of truvada so were seeing a chronicity a regular use among prepusing individuals and the final thing i would say ian is that we are seeing other parties starting to announce that for example retail pharmacies are beginning initiatives that their pharmacist can engage in conversations on prep and what prep is about and educate people who come into a retail pharmacy to ask about prep medication so thats also i think part of the momentum and movement thats going on right now norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc yeah ian from a clinical point of view its very simple its a noninferiority study we want to simply show that regarding efficacywise that ftaf is the same as truvada along with improved renal and bone parameters and then because its much easier and safer to use you dont have to monitor creatinine you dont have to look for people that are at risk for bone effects you dont have to measure bmd that its a much preferred agent to truvada thats essentially what were showing thats why it takes  patients by the way its not a small study to do m ian somaiya  bmo capital markets united states right i guess norbert what i was trying to understand is is the patient sensitivity any different are they more sensitive or less sensitive to the adverse event profile of taf given that theyre – obviously dont carry the infection norbert w bischofberger  gilead sciences inc no actually ian so i dont have those data yet but we answered that question when we did the prep studies with truvada there was a question that both we and the fda had and the question was can you take safety data from hivinfected individuals and extrapolate the nonhiv infected and the conclusion was you cant so we generated data in about i cant remember  patients total that were not hiv infected and that database convinced everybody that the safety is the same theres no difference between hiv infected and nonhiv infected patients operator our next question comes from salim syed with mizuho salim syed  mizuho securities usa inc hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter just on when were thinking about the tail for hepatitis c i dont think  these numbers in a while but correct me if im wrong theres  million patients treated and there was  million to begin with in the us and people have previously thought there was  that are uninsured and untreated of the  million of which that  is part of is there any other patient population as you guys have had more time pass thats not treatable here or reasonably treatable kevin b young  gilead sciences inc hey salim its kevin weve always in the us gone with figures that are about  million infected and about  million that are diagnosed no i dont think theres any sort of difference in our opinions of the market there is a proportion of patients that is uninsured there are a group of patients that are incarcerated as john said earlier we see very little treatment we continue to have conversations with the various states around their systems of incarceration but there doesnt seem to be much momentum about that we talked in the past about obviously the va the va has been incredibly proactive theyve dedicated money we are hearing we dont have direct data but were hearing that it is slowing down a little bit like the general market but they continue their efforts to outbound information and try and get people into the system theyre incredibly enthusiastic to try and heal their veterans and theres the continuation as john said of the commercial markets and we certainly are doing our part to try and highlight to patients the need to be tested and that there are very comprehensive ways of curing the disease so i think for us to continue to do that at some point at some point there will be some equilibrium and that will still be a lot of patients and with a incredible treatment that cures payers providers will be motivated to use therapies so i dont think there has been any big ahas for us or particular opening of new patient groups in the past  months salim syed  mizuho securities usa inc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of carter gould with ubs carter gould  ubs securities llc good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question i guess kevin on the get tested campaign is the expectation that screening volumes will still continue to grow meaningfully or should we expect that impact to plateau and is it safe to say that program will continue unchanged when abbvie enters the market thank you kevin b young  gilead sciences inc good question carter i dont know what way we could go higher we always feel that part of our role in the areas in our large areas that we operate is to provide education as a reminder our baby boomer campaign is not aired as much as our harvoni campaign but i think in general terms yes we feel that it is important to continue to highlight that baby boomers potentially who have been in a situation of risk that they might go and ask for a test and be screened and find out their status lets not forget that that principle is backed by the cdc and there is gilead and there are many other parties that support baby boomers finding out their hcv status and if they are positive then to take the steps forward so yes we feel that as the leader in hcv it is part and parcel of the role we play carter gould  ubs securities llc thank you operator and that concludes todays questionandanswer session id like to turn the call back to mr lee for any closing remarks sung lee  gilead

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
