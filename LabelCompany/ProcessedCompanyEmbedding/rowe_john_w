​david greising writes a column for the chicago news cooperativethe man at the lectern boasted about his company’s performance record criticized the mishmash of government regulations controlling his operations and explained his industry with help of a venn diagramyet in his speech at the economic club of chicago on wednesday he also quoted alexander pope mark twain and huey long he made a biting remark about jon corzine and told a good enron storyin both respects he was quintessentially john w roweutility executives can be as dull as beige paint and mr rowe can wonk with the beigest of them but mr rowe the outgoing chairman of commonwealth edison’s parent company exelon corp also can paint in broad colorful strokes he conjures literature or history to make his points and he has an earthy humor perhaps born of his upbringing on a southern wisconsin farmexplaining why exelon has not invested more aggressively in newenergy technologies like windmills and solar cells mr rowe deadpanned “a dinosaur cannot save itself from extinction by mating with a rodent” advertisement continue reading the main story given the scale of exelon’s coal and nuclearplant infrastructure some of it decades old mr rowe said it would be unrealistic to expect that wind or solar power would be material to exelon’s business any time soon continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story mr rowe is one of a dying breed of chicago chief executives at a time when executives are transients often unwilling to delve into the details of civic life he has stayed put led his company through crises and invested not just exelon’s treasures but also his personal wealth and time back into the communitywith his wife jeanne mr rowe has founded two charter schools and spent enough time at them so that the challenges of urban education he said “get into your skin”not long ago such types were commonplace in chicago’s boardrooms sara lee was run by john bryan standard oil by john swearingen and commonwealth edison by james o’connor lester crown is one of the few such civicminded throwbacks who remain active photo “a dinosaur cannot save itself from extinction by mating with a rodent said john rowe the outgoing chairman of exelon corporation credit andrew harrerbloomberg news mr rowe has left his mark using grace or muscle depending on the circumstances he fixed exelon’s array of brokendown nuclearpower reactors and pushed through a deregulation agenda that has left his company better off — at the cost of giving the public less say in what customers pay in his last full year of work he steamrolled smart grid legislation through springfield and put together the  billion purchase of constellation energyat his valedictory at the economic club mr rowe spoke with the ease of an executive at the end of a year tenure who will not shade what he says just to be politicmr rowe extolled his company’s environmental record in one breath but in the next he rhapsodized about the unlimited promise of hydraulic fracturing — the environmentally dubious process of using highpressure liquid to crack bedrock extracting oil and gas from it newsletter sign up continue

rowe acknowledges the science then correctly points out that politics will prevent any action in the foreseeable futureanother example mr rowe is politically conservative yet he parts company with fellow conservatives on immigration policy when he mentors young immigrants he said he finds it difficult to explain why they should go to college in a country where they will not be able to work legally even with a college degree advertisement continue reading the main story “when the hell did it become conservative to say people can’t work and can’t pay taxes” he asked the audience “i don’t get it”mr rowe acknowledged that few things are certain in the chief executive’s corner office and he did so typically with an extended metaphor drawn from literature he quoted mark twain’s description of the riverboat captain negotiating the bends and sandbars of a riverbright light and dark shadows each create their own problems and risks the author explained but the most treacherous times come when the world is cast in shades of gray“you take a night when there’s one of these grisly drizzly gray mists and then there isn’t any particular shape to a shore” twain wrote “a gray mist would tangle the head of the oldest man who ever lived”mr rowe’s is one gray head whose thinking — and leadership — are rarely tangled continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback

of the macarthur foundation study of aging in america which show how to maintain optimum physical and mental strength throughout later liferesearch into aging has been revolutionized in the past ten years largely due to the macarthur study which under the leadership of drs john w rowe and robert l kahn created a network of leading research scientists from key fields to determine what aging actually involves rejecting the established approach of studying aging in terms of anticipated decline these scientists set out to identify the factors that were enabling vast numbers of people to preserve and even enhance their mental and physical vitality in later lifesuccessful aging brings together the remarkable results of the study for the first time they explode the myths about aging that have long shaped individual and institutional attitudes toward growing older including the biggest myth of all quotthe key to aging well is choosing your parents wiselyquot in fact they discovered that lifestyle choicesmore than genesdetermine how well we age drs rowe and kahn outline those vital choices including changes in diet types of exercise mental stimulation selfefficacy and dynamic connections these choices can make a difference no matter how late in life they are made in addition drs rowe and kahn include the latest researchbased strategies to delay or prevent the common diseases of old agesociety can also influence how we age drs rowe and kahn detail innovative programs and policies that are enabling older men and women to stay healthy and to continue to contribute to their societiesfor all of us the rewards of successful aging are great this eyeopening work shows how they can be attained and enjoyedfrom the hardcover editionagingcondition used

business days faq policy about this book wood as found in trees and bushes was of primary importance to ancient humans in their struggle to control their environment subsequent evolution through the bronze and iron ages up to our present technologically advanced society has hardly diminished the importance of wood today its role as a source of paper products furniture building materials and fuel is still of major significance wood consists of a mixture of polymers often referred to as lignocellulose the cellulose micro fibrils consist of an immensely strong linear polymer of glucose they are associated with smaller more complex polymers composed of various sugars called hemicelluloses these polysaccharides are embedded in an amorphous phenylpropane polymer lignin creating a remarkably strong com­ posite structure the lignocellulosic cell wall wood also contains materials that are largely extraneous to this lignocellulosic cell wall these extracellular substances can range from less than  to about  of the dry weight of the wood but the usual range is   among these components are the mineral constituents salts of calcium potassium sodium and other metals particularly those present in the soil where the tree is growing some of the extraneous components of wood are too insoluble to be ex­ tracted by inert solvents and remain to give extractivefree wood its color very often these

liner for spill containment manholes for repairing existing leaking spill containment manholes or to provide double wall protection for new or existing single wall spill containment manholes comprising means for containing spilled fluids  the liner for spill containment manholes in accordance with claim  wherein said means for containing spilled fluids comprises a flexible membrane that may be collapsed while being installed into the spill container has a surface for attaching to the snow plow ring has a surface for attaching to the tank riser is fuel resistant may be coated with a highly fuel resistant material may be manufactured with one or more sections that are bonded together to create the liner description field of the inventionthe present invention relates to containment of fluids and more particularly to the containment of fluids in overfill or spill containersbackground of the inventionprior to  the us epa determined that significant pollution was occurring in the us due to fuel leaking from a number of sources at fueling facilities gas stations tanks piping from tanks to dispensers fuel leaks at the dispensers and fuel discharges caused by overfilling tanks and from fuel remaining in the filling hoses all contributed to pollution at fueling facilities the us epa established guidelines for upgrading fueling facilities including requiring a means of catching fuel discharged in the process of filling the tanks these catchment basins came to be know as “spill containers” “spill containment manholes” “spill containment buckets” and a host of other similar descriptions some spill containers were and are manufactured out of welded metal other less expensive spill containers were and are manufactured using a plastic bellows the plastic bellows style of spill container became the popular choice and is found at most fueling facilities todayover time spill containers themselves have started leaking some states have now regulated the testing and certifying of the spill containers on a periodic basis as an example the state of alabama has started requiring that spill containment manholes be hydrostatically tested any leaking spill container must be repaired or replaced or the service station can be shut down until the offending spill container can be replaced since the installation of the first spill containment manholes in the late s there has been a need for an inexpensive repair of leaking spill containerspresently the only known solution is to replace the manhole with a new onereplacing an existing spill containment manhole is an expensive process requiring in most instances that at least part of the site be closed while repairs are being performed excavating equipment is required concrete must be broken and removed and a new spill container must be purchased and installed delays may be encountered to obtain permits my recent survey conducted in  of replaced spill containers indicates the cost is approximately  per unit this cost does not account for lost fuel revenues costs of permits and any clean up costs associated with the uncovering of contaminated soils surrounding the leaking spill containerit would be advantageous to provide a liner that is fuel resistantit would also be advantageous to provide a liner that can be made to closely match the inside of the existing spill container so as to minimize the loss of capacity of the spill container once the liner is in placeit would also be advantageous to provide a liner that can create a total seal between the snow plow ring installed on the surface of the fueling facility and the riser pipe extending from the fuel tankit would also be advantageous if the cost of the liner installed is a fraction of replacing the spill containerit would also be advantageous if the spill container can be repaired without breaking concrete or using construction equipmentit would also be advantageous if the liner could be installed within a few hours by a single technicianit would also be advantageous if the liner could be coated with a film of material that is highly chemically resistant to the liquids to be encounteredit would further be advantageous if the liner could be used to convert an existing single walled spill container to a double walled spill containersummary of the inventionin accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of repairing a leaking spill containment manhole by lining the existing unit additionally the liner can be used to convert a structurally sound single walled spill containment manhole into a double walled spill containment manholebrief description of the drawingsa complete understanding of the present invention may be obtained by reference to the accompanying drawings when considered in conjunction with the subsequent detailed description in whichfig  is a cross section view of an existing spill container with a plastic bellowsfig  is a cross section view of an existing spill container with a metal bodyfig  is a cross section view of the components required to manufacture a linerfig  is a cross section view of a bellows style spill container with a drain valve mounted on a tank riserfig  is a cross section view of a bellows style spill container where fill has been added to cover the irregular shape of the bottom of the spill containerfig  is a cross section view of an of the liner showing the coated surface ready to be installed in a bellows style spill container andfig  is a cross section view of a bellows style spill container with the liner installedfor purposes of clarity and brevity like elements and components will bear the same designations and numbering throughout the figuresdescription of the preferred embodimentthis invention is best understood by referring initially to existing spill containment manholes in fig  and fig  fig  is a cross section view of a spill containment manhole with a bellows  style body a snow plow ring  common to most spill containers a base  common to most spill containers a drain valve  common to most spill containers and a tank riser  common to all spill containers fig  is a cross section view of a spill containment manhole with a metal body in lieu of the bellows style body shown if fig  the spill containment manhole in figs  and  are connected to a ″ tank riser  extending from the top of the buried fuel tank the surface of a fueling facility is covered with a concrete slab the snow plow ring  is mounted more or less flush with the top of the concrete slab attached to the snow plow ring  is the rest of the spill container the bellows  is normally attached to the underside of the snow plow ring  by means of bolts through a lip on the top of the bellows  terminating into the bottom of the snow plow ring  the bellows  is terminated to the base  in any number of manners including bolts band clamps or other securing devices the riser inside the spill container is terminated into the base  of the spill container often a drain valve  is installed in the base  so that liquids captured in the spill container may be drained into the tank riser  all seams or joints created at the junction of the various components may create leak paths spill containers that incorporate a plastic bellows  have proven to have a high failure rate of the bellows  itself there are at least nine different spill containment manufacturers and each may have multiple configurations of their spill containers it is not necessary to identify all the permutations that may be encountered in the field figs  and  represent cross sections of typical spill containers encountered in the industry irrespective of the cause and location of a failed leaking spill container or the configuration of the spill container my invention provides means for repairing these spill containersfig  is a cross section view of the components of a liner  when the liner top  is joined to the liner bottom  the liner  is created in some instances the liner  may be manufactured as a single component such a liner  could be fitted into fig  and function as designed however most spill containers have a mouth opening smaller than the diameter of the bellows  section of the spill container as shown in fig  it is preferred that the liner  fit the interior profile of the spill container as liner  needs to be as large as possible so as to not unduly reduce the capacity of the spill container large “collapsing core” molds could be made to manufacture the various liners in one piece it is preferred however to manufacture the liner  from two or more segments it is preferred to manufacture a separate liner bottom  and a separate liner top  and join the components by a suitable connecting method in that manner the tooling required to make all the configurations of liners required can be minimized the bottom from one liner  and the top from another liner  may be joined to form a third liner  in the preferred embodiment a bonding agent is used to bond the liner  to the snow plow ring  and to the tank riser  while bonding is not required it is a highly recommended procedure that assures a long lasting product requiring little maintenance the liner  material should be chemically resistant to the liquids to be encountered the liner  should be able to be bonded a to the mating spill container and tank riser  surfaces as well as being able to be bonded together one such material that has been tested by underwriters laboratories for use in secondary containment applications at fueling sites is pellethane abr available from dow chemical co additionally the liner  may have a coating  applied a suitable coating  material is used to make the liner  chemically more resistant to the specific fluids to be contained a polysulfide liquid is available from diversified products manufacturing inc part number dbf ii it is a suitable material for applications where motor fuels are to be encountered polysulfide has been used for years to coat the inside of fuel cells in aircraftfig  also shows an expanding compression ring  while the expanding compression ring  is not required the preferred embodiment uses the expanding compression ring  to apply mild pressure to bonding surface a  while the bonding agent is curing after the bonding agent has cured approximately  minutes in the preferred embodiment the expanding compression ring  may be removed and used on the next installation the expanding compression ring  may be made of any suitable material plastic metal or wood etcthe band clamp  in fig  is used to tighten the liner  to the tank riser  in the preferred embodiment the liner  is bonded to the riser then clamped to hold the liner  to the tank riser  while curing the band clamp  while not essential is preferred any properly sized all stainless band clamp  in the market today will work for this application such a clamp is available from norton industries inc part number br which fits ″ tank risersfig  shows the cross section of a spill container to be repaired and the areas requiring preparation prior to the installation of the liner  the liner  may be bonded to the spill containment snow plow ring  at bonding surface a  a second bonding surface b  is located on the tank riser  these surfaces if bonded require proper preparation for the bonding agents to be used the preparation and bonding agent used is a function of the materials selected to manufacture the liner  in the preferred embodiment a methyl methacrylate is used one such material is manufactured by available from weld on part number ss stock   it is anticipated that other bonding agents will be found that will perform as well as or better than the currently preferred product surface preparation for the preferred embodiment includes sanding bonding surface a  then cleaning with tetrachloroethylene when the surfaces are clean and dry the bonding agent may be applied to the mating surfaces to be bonded the drain valve  must be removed and the resulting hole plugged use a plug  with the same thread pattern as the removed drain valve  the plug  may be made of any material as it will be covered with a fill  during the installation processfig  is a cross section of the bellows  style spill container where fill  has been added to cover the irregular shape of the bottom of the spill container it should be noted that the connection between the spill container and the tank riser  varies by manufacturer most spill containers have bolt heads that connect the bellows  to the body andor some sort of compression coupling or screwed coupling or other means for joining the tank riser  to the spill container these connection methods create an uneven surface at the bottom of the spill container in order to make the repair easier it is recommended that the uneven bottom of the spill container be leveled the preferred embodiment of the invention uses a liquid form of polysulfide to fill  the bottom to a level above any irregularities encountered the preferred polysulfide is a two part chemical that when mixed forms a permanent barrier to most fuels and bonds to metal and the liner  materials in the preferred embodiment the preferred fill  material is available from diversified products manufacturing inc oroville calif part number dbf ii while the fill  is not mandatory it is recommended in the preferred embodiment any liner  not using a fill  is subject to unnecessary wear and premature failure manufacturing a unique liner  for each manufacturer of spill container may be undertaken however the tooling for this process would be unduly costlythe cross section of fig  shows the spill container ready for the application of the bonding agent to the tank riser  and the subsequent installation of the liner  the surface of the tank riser  located under the clamping area should be cleaned prior to applying the bonding agent typically the tank risers are steel when the riser is clean apply the bonding agent to the bonding surface b  for approximately ½″ above the polysulfide fill  the entire perimeter of the tank riser  should be covered with the bonding agentfig  is a cross section view of the liner  ready to be installed in a bellows  style spill container in this embodiment the liner top  and liner bottom  are shown as one piece the liner  may be made up of one two pieces as shown in the preferred embodiment or as many pieces as necessary to match the liner  to be spill container in the preferred embodiment the liner top  and liner bottom  and are joined together using a solvent welding process the material used to manufacture the liner  is dissolved in a strong solvent such as tetrahydrofuran forming a pregnant solution when this solution is applied to the mating and preferably overlapping surfaces of the liner top  and liner bottom  a solvent weld is created the process of solvent welding is common knowledge and need not be reiterated here the welded seam thus created is as strong as the liner top  or liner bottom  the liner  is collapsed when installed into the spill container shown in fig fig  is a cross section view of a bellows  style spill container with the liner  the installed the top of the liner  should mate to the inside of the spill containers snow plow ring  the application of the bonding agent to bonding surface a  is applied at this time by folding down the collapsible liner  and running a bead of the bonding agent around the perimeter of the liner top  and mating surface of the snow plow ring  the top of the liner  may be held in place by an expanding compression ring  while the bonding agent cures after curing of the bonding agent the repair of the spill containment manhole is completesince other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this inventionhaving thus described the
