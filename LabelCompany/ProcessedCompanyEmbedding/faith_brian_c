brian c houston  december  part  a glorious future day  message a robust faith oh teach us to live wisely and well… psalm  message the key to your glorious future is in your faith it is one thing to say you believe and quite another to act on what you believe as though it is already true what do you do when you are praying for something and things appear unchanged or even deteriorating that’s when you discover whether you have developed faith that refuses to quit or let go of the promises of god’s word to survive life’s harshest blows your faith must be robust and resilient the word robust means “strong and healthy hardy and vigorous” hebrews  begins by defining its focus “now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good testimony”v these elders of the faith included noah abraham and sarah jacob joseph moses rahab samuel david and many others their “good testimony” is the legacy of faith they left the story of how they trusted god in the midst of overwhelming ordeals and obstacles they were not a superior species but normal men and women with fears and faults clearly it wasn’t their strength that caused the victories it was actually despite their weaknesses that god enabled them to do amazing feats conquer kingdoms overcome lions quench fires dodge swords and win battles when overwhelmingly outnumbered heb – that is definitely courageous faith the bible frequently talks about a “fight” of faith romans  calls us “more than conquerors” and if so then we know that we will face mountains and battles that we must conquer how can we be overcomers if there is nothing to overcome if life had no hurdles or challenges faith would have no purpose it is easy to have faith when everything is going well but courageous and robust faith is forged only through testing to move into your glorious future there will be times when you will need to have courageous and robust faith no doubt you will have opportunities to exercise the courage to share your faith to do the right thing to live well lead well and love well in the face of challenges and hold firm to god’s promises  prayer lord i won’t be dismayed when challenges come the word of god says that my faith will be refined by the fire and your strength is made perfect in my weakness  corinthians   peter  romans  amp click here for the

seriousminded christians who wish to develop a fullorbed faith that encompasses their emotional life “brian borgman has written a wonderfully christcentered and godglorifying book about how by god’s grace to restore your emotions to god’s image feelings and faith paints a biblically accurate picture of as the puritan pastors expressed it ‘holy emotions’ it does not dismiss emotions as some do nor does it worship emotions as some do this is an important book and i highly recommend it” — martha peace biblical counselor author the excellent wife “here is a readable but comprehensive study that unites in biblical friendship the christian’s theology and experience with the heart of a pastor brain borgman offers an emotional life line that will stabilize your heart and support your faith faith and feelings needs to be in your personal library i will return to it time and againso will you” — jani ortlund executive vice president renewal ministries author fearlessly feminine and his loving law our lasting legacy “as christians who hasn’t been confused about the relationship between our faith and our feelings are feelings an incredibly important part of your faith giving you heartfelt ways to express love to god and others or are they actually to be jettisoned from your faith being perceived as something dangerous in your relationship to christ in this immensely profitable book brian borgman a very surefooted guide to this topic biblically and precisely explains the concept of emotion and how it is to be integrated into one’s walk with the lord i know of no other book quite like it all at once it is scriptural wise clear pastoral transparent and compelling this is a great resource for instance for a pastor who desires help in skillfully shepherding his sheep it is also a wonderful help for a discipler andor counselor who wants to instruct his disciples and counselees with their fears worries and anxieties even further the principles in this work should prove to be of real lasting value to any believer in jesus who earnestly yearns to first grasp and then harness his or her own emotions within the context of a sensate culture that is quickly careening out of emotional control for all who read this book we should genuinely applaud pastor borgman’s diligent efforts in now bringing us the most helpful volume available on the subject of faith and feelings” —
