dr stewart for many yearsthey have since moved away and had to switch doctors but i am still a patient of amanda choi as far as the staff i have had no issues the staff was always easy to work with to reschedule appointments which is usually where office staff tend to be rude i really enjoy having amanda as my doctor im in good health so i havent been a complicated patient but the times i have been sick and needed an appointment quickly it was easy to schedule and get the attention i needed amanda is extremely thorough and has a great memory she always asks me about something i mentioned to her a year ago at my last visit she knows her patients well which in my opinion is one of the most important qualities in a doctor she notes events in my life and treats health in the same way following up on any concerns or conditions i had mentioned in the past i highly recommend this office for a longterm doctor that will know your history and provide genuine care its tough to give any business a low review and sadly this review would have been much higher had it not been for the terrible front office staff the nurse practitioner amanda choi and dr stewart are great both are personable and knowledgeable and i think amanda is very through and has a great memory however when it comes to the office the buck stops here ann the front office person is curt rude and it feels like youre pulling teeth to get anything out of her her tone is always snide on the phone and you can tell that she is dispassionate about being in customer service the office manager just hides behind ann and there doesnt seem to be any gusto in this office due to the lack of leadership and disorganization by the front office they claim to mail things to you address when nothing is received they claim to call you for appointments  even going as far as to say that i spoke to you on x day when that never happened and then they have fees for everything even if you want a copy of your test results the behavior of the office support staff has worsened over the years which is why i have found another practice  that is just as knowledgeable as dr stewart and amanda minus the rude front office team do you value your time dr stewarts office wont ive been to dr stewarts office twice now oct   may  both times i have gone for a routine visit i have had to wait waaaaaaay too long this past visit may  i arrived at

weight and explain my symptoms after those quick checks i was walked down the hall to an exam room and put in there by myself to wait to see someone and thennothing an hour went by before i finally just got up and walked out i told the receptionist that i could no longer wait to see a physician based on my schedule i needed to see a physician but i didnt need for it to be an event requiring me to take a halfday off of work to see them after leaving i fully expected one of james stewarts staff to call me perhaps apologetically and attempt to reschedule needless to say they never called hows that for customer service find someone else i can assure you that your appointment time doesnt really matter to them i saw the reviews dr stewarts office got on this website prior to my appt however his office is very close to my house so i decided to try it out for myself i was quite surprised i found his staff very friendly the nurse practitioner i saw was very knowledgeable and took her time with me i felt like they really cared about my well being i loved the receptionist i found her nice and pleasant with everyone even the girls in the back that took my blood were very nice i was very impressed in fact im moving my husband and daughters over to this practice even going to move my  yr old parents i went in with very low expectations and walked out feeling great i would highly

whole family parents and brother used to got to dr stewart for many yearsthey have since moved away and had to switch doctors but i am still a patient of amanda choi as far as the staff i have had no

been a complicated patient but the times i have been sick and needed an appointment quickly it was easy to schedule and get the attention i needed amanda is extremely thorough and has a great memory

whole family parents and brother used to got to dr stewart for many yearsthey have since moved away and had to switch doctors but i am still a patient of amanda choi as far as the staff i have had no

been a complicated patient but the times i have been sick and needed an appointment quickly it was easy to schedule and get the attention i needed amanda is extremely thorough and has a great memory

and it feels like youre pulling teeth to get anything out of her her tone is always snide on the phone and you can tell that she is dispassionate about being in customer service the office manager just hides behind ann and there doesnt seem to be any gusto in this office due to the lack of leadership and disorganization by the front office they claim to mail things to you address when nothing is received they claim to call you for appointments  even going as far as to say that i spoke to you on x day when that never happened and then they have fees for everything even if you want a copy of your test results the behavior of the office support staff has worsened over the years which is why i have found another practice  that is just as knowledgeable as dr stewart and amanda minus the rude

knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and its not always so easy to get a thought out it took a little time for the sound men to get used to him but he had an enormous impact and then some years later marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that jimmy did it first collaborations with hitchcock and mannedit in stewarts collaborations with director anthony mann he entered the realm of the western stewarts first appearance in a film directed by mann came with the  western winchester  in choosing mann after first choice fritz lang declined stewart cemented a powerful partnership the film which became a boxoffice hit upon its release set the pattern for their future collaborations in it stewart is a tough

director anthony mann five of them were westerns including the naked spur  other stewart–mann westerns such as bend of the river  the naked spur  the far country  and the man from laramie  were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the american west frequently the films featured stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption while facing corrupt cattlemen ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it the stewart–mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the s and remain popular today for their grittier more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre audiences saw stewarts screen persona evolve into a more mature more ambiguous and edgier presence stewart and mann also collaborated on other films outside the western genre the glenn miller story  was critically acclaimed garnering stewart a bafta award nomination and together with the spirit of st louis continued stewarts portrayals

in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval stewart ended up earning about  for winchester  alone hollywoods other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business which further undermined the decaying studio system the second collaboration to define stewarts career in the s was with director alfred hitchcock like mann hitchcock uncovered new

window widely considered one of hitchcocks masterpieces stewart portrays photographer lb jeff jeffries loosely based on life photographer robert capa who projects his fantasies and fears onto the

murder and when his glamorous girlfriend grace kelly at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery limited by his

most personal film vertigo  the movie starred stewart as john scottie ferguson a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing scotties obsession inevitably leads to the destruction of everything he once had and believed in though the film is widely considered a classic today vertigo met with very mixed reviews and poor boxoffice receipts upon its release and marked the last collaboration between stewart and hitchcock the director reportedly blamed the films failure on stewart looking too old to be kim novaks love interest and

foreshadowing his starring movie role as lindbergh  years later however he abandoned visions of being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the united states naval academy he attend

stewart later recalled id only worked three months every play i got into folded by  he was given more substantial stage roles including the modest hit page miss glory and his first dramatic stage role in sidney howards yellow jack which convinced him to continue his acting career however stewart and fonda still roommates were both struggling in the fall of  fondas success in the farmer takes a wife took him to hollywood finally stewart attracted the interest of mgm scout bill grady who saw stewart on the opening night of divided by three a glittering première with many luminaries in attendance including irving berlin moss hart and fonda who had returned to new york for the show with fondas encouragement stewart agreed to take a screen test after which he signed a contract with mgm in april  as a contract player for up to seven years at  a week stewart made four features with margaret sullavan the second of which was the shopworn angel  upon stewarts arrival by train in los angeles fonda greeted him at the station and took him to fondas studiosupplied lodging next door to greta garbo stewarts first job at the studio was as a participant in screen tests with newly arrived starlets at first he had trouble being cast in hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy humble screen presence aside from an unbilled appearance in a shemp howard comedy short called art trouble in  his first film was the poorly received spencer tracy vehicle the murder man  rose marie  an adaptation of a popular operetta was more successful after having mixed success in films he received his first intensely dramatic role in s after the thin man and played jean harlows characters frustrated boyfriend in the clark gable vehicle wife vs secretary earlier that same year on the romantic front he dated newly divorced ginger rogers the romance soon cooled however and by chance stewart encountered margaret sullavan again stewart found his footing in hollywood thanks largely to sullavan who campaigned for stewart to be her leading man in the  romantic comedy next time we love she rehearsed extensively with him having a noticeable effect on his confidence she encouraged stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style stewart was enjoying hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage as he worked six days a week in the mgm factory in  he acquired bigtime agent leland hayward who would eventually marry sullavan hayward started to chart stewarts career deciding that the best path for him was through loanouts to other studios prewar successedit frank capras comedy you cant take it with you  was one of the films that brought stewart widespread attention in  stewart had a brief tumultuous romance with hollywood queen norma shearer whose husband irving thalberg head of production at mgm had died two years earlier stewart began a successful partnership with director frank capra in  when he was loaned out to columbia pictures to star in you cant take it with you capra had been impressed by stewarts minor role in navy blue and gold  the director had recently completed several well received films including it happened one night  and was looking for the right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in capras films such as clark gable ronald colman and gary cooper did not quite fit not only was stewart just what he was looking for but capra also found stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing later capra commented i think hes probably the best actor whos ever hit the screen you cant take it with you starring capras favorite actress comedian jean arthur won the  best picture academy award the following year saw stewart work with capra and arthur again in the political comedydrama mr smith goes to washington stewart replaced intended star gary cooper in the film playing an idealist thrown into the political arena upon its october

leaving hollywood and its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life stewart took a secret trip to europe to take a break and returned home in  just as germany invaded poland you hear so much about the old movie moguls and the impersonal factories where there is no freedom mgm was a wonderful place where decisions were made on my behalf by my superiors whats wrong with that james stewart the leading men of mgm destry rides again also released in  became stewarts first western film a genre with which he would become identified later in his career in this western parody he is a pacifist lawman and marlene dietrich is the dancing saloon girl who comes to love him but does not get him offscreen dietrich did get her man but the romance was shortlived made for each other  had stewart sharing the screen with carole lombard in a melodrama that garnered good reviews for both stars but did less well with the public newsweek wrote that they were perfectly cast in the leading roles between movies stewart began a radio career and became a distinctive voice on the lux radio theaters the screen guild theater and other shows so wellknown had his slow drawl become that comedians began impersonating him in  stewart and sullavan reunited for two films the first the ernst lubitsch romantic comedy the shop around the corner starred them as coworkers unknowingly involved in a penpal romance but who cannot stand each other in real life it was stewarts fifth film of the year and one of the rare ones shot in sequence it was completed in only  days the mortal storm directed by frank borzage was one of the first blatantly antinazi films to be produced in hollywood and featured sullavan and stewart as friends and then lovers caught in turmoil upon hitlers rise to power literally hunted down by their own friends stewart won his only academy award for best actor for s the philadelphia story he is seen here with costar katharine hepburn stewart also starred with

by a chimpanzee in the documentary film james stewart a wonderful life  hosted by johnny carson stewart said that he went back to westerns in  in part because of the string of flops he returned to the

successful biographical film the stratton story in  stewarts first pairing with onscreen wife june allyson his career took another turn during the s he expanded into the western and suspense genres

his westerns cary grant said of stewarts acting technique he had the ability to talk naturally he knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and its not always so easy to get a thought out it took a little time for the sound men to get used to him but he had an enormous impact and then some years later marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that jimmy did it first collaborations with hitchcock and mannedit in stewarts collaborations with director anthony mann he entered the realm of the western stewarts first appearance in a film directed by mann came with the  western winchester  in choosing mann after first choice fritz lang declined stewart cemented a powerful partnership the film which became a boxoffice hit upon its release set the pattern for their future collaborations in it stewart is a tough revengeful sharpshooter the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands until the showdown between stewart and his brother stephen mcnally stewart made eight films for director anthony mann five of them were westerns including the naked spur  other stewart–mann westerns such as bend of the river  the naked spur  the far country  and the man from laramie  were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the american west frequently the films featured stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption while facing corrupt cattlemen ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it the stewart–mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the s and remain popular today for their grittier more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre audiences saw stewarts screen persona evolve into a more mature more ambiguous and edgier presence stewart and mann also collaborated on other films outside the western genre the glenn miller story  was critically acclaimed garnering stewart a bafta award nomination and together with the spirit of st louis continued stewarts portrayals of american heroes thunder bay released the same year transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations to a more contemporary setting with stewart as a louisiana oil driller facing corruption strategic air command released in  allowed stewart to use his experiences in the united states air force on film stewarts starring role in winchester  was also a turning point in hollywood universal studios who wanted stewart to appear in both that film and harvey balked at his  asking price his agent lew wasserman brokered an alternate deal in which stewart would appear in both films for no pay in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval stewart ended up earning about  for winchester  alone hollywoods other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business which further undermined the decaying studio system the second collaboration to define stewarts career in the s was with director alfred hitchcock like mann hitchcock uncovered new depths to stewarts acting showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires stewarts first movie with hitchcock was the technologically innovative  film rope shot in long real time takes rear window  was one of four films stewart made with alfred hitchcock stewart became the highestgrossing star of  as a result the two collaborated for the second of four times on the  hit rear window widely considered one of hitchcocks masterpieces stewart portrays photographer lb jeff jeffries loosely based on life photographer robert capa who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg jeffries gets into more than he can handle however when he believes he has witnessed a salesman raymond burr commit a murder and when his glamorous girlfriend grace kelly at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery limited by his wheelchair stewart is led by hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial

former police investigator suffering from acrophobia who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing scotties obsession inevitably leads to the destruction of everything he once had and believed in though the film is widely considered a classic today vertigo met with very mixed reviews and poor boxoffice receipts upon its release and marked the last collaboration between stewart and

returning from service in world war ii during which he experienced what is now recognized as posttraumatic stress disorder author robert matzen wrote that the movie provided an outlet for stewarts raw feelings he wrote that he did not think stewart had that kind of capacity before the war it enabled him to be ferocious and to have that raw emotion capra paid rko for the rights to the story and formed his own production company liberty films the female lead went to donna reed when capras perennial first choice jean arthur was unavailable and after ginger rogers olivia de havilland ann dvorak and martha scott had all turned down the role stewart appeared as george bailey an upstanding smalltown man who becomes increasingly frustrated by his ordinary existence and financial troubles driven to suicide on christmas eve he is led to reassess his life by clarence odbody an angel second class played by henry travers although its a wonderful life was nominated for five academy awards including stewarts third best actor nomination it received mixed reviews and only disappointingly moderate success at the box office however in the decades since the films release it grew to define stewarts film persona and is widely considered as a sentimental christmas film classic and according to the american film institute one of the  best american movies ever made in an interview with michael parkinson in  stewart declared that out of all the movies he had made its a wonderful life was his favorite after viewing the film president harry s truman concluded if bess and i had a son

opinion polling it was poorly received he completed rope  directed by alfred hitchcock and call northside   and weathered two boxoffice disappointments with on our merry way  a comedic musical ensemble in which stewart and henry fonda were paired as two jazz musicians and you gotta stay happy  for which the posters depicted stewart being kissed on one cheek by joan fontaine and on the other by a chimpanzee in the documentary film james stewart a wonderful life  hosted by johnny carson stewart said that he went back to westerns in  in part because of the string of flops he returned to the stage to star in mary coyle chases harvey which had opened to nearly universal praise in november  as elwood p dowd a wealthy eccentric living with his sister and niece and whose best friend is an invisible rabbit as large as a man dowds eccentricity especially the friendship with the rabbit is ruining the nieces hopes of finding a husband while trying to have dowd committed to a sanatorium his sister is committed herself while the play follows dowd on an ordinary day in his notsoordinary life stewart took over the role from frank fay and gained an increased broadway following in the unconventional play the play which ran for nearly three years with stewart as its star was successfully adapted into a  film directed by henry koster with stewart reprising his role and josephine hull portraying his sister bing crosby was the first choice but he declined stewart received his fourth best actor nomination for his performance stewart also played the role on broadway in  which was shot on videotape for nbc as part of the hallmark hall of fame series in  and on the london stage in  after harvey the world war ii film malaya  with spencer tracy and the conventional but highly successful biographical film the stratton story in  stewarts first pairing with onscreen wife june allyson his career took another turn during the s he expanded into the western and suspense genres thanks to collaborations with alfred hitchcock and anthony mann other performances by stewart during this time include the critically acclaimed  delmer daves western broken arrow which featured stewart as an exsoldier and indian agent making peace with the apache a troubled clown in the  best picture the greatest show on earth and stewarts role as charles lindbergh in billy wilders  the spirit of st louis he also starred in the western radio show the six shooter for its oneseason run from  to  during this time stewart wore the same cowboy hat and rode the same horse pie in most of his westerns cary grant said of stewarts acting technique he had the ability to talk naturally he knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and its not always so easy to get a thought out it took a little time for the sound men to get used to him but he had an enormous impact and then some years later marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that jimmy did it first collaborations with hitchcock and mannedit in stewarts collaborations with director anthony mann he entered the realm of the western stewarts first appearance in a film directed by mann came with the  western winchester  in choosing mann after first choice fritz lang declined stewart cemented a powerful partnership the film which became a boxoffice hit upon its release set the pattern for their future collaborations in it stewart is a tough revengeful sharpshooter the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands until the showdown between stewart and his brother stephen mcnally stewart made eight films for director anthony mann five of them were westerns including the naked spur  other stewart–mann westerns such as bend of the river  the naked spur  the far country  and the man from laramie  were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the american west frequently the films featured stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption while facing corrupt cattlemen ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it the stewart–mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the s and remain popular today for their grittier more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre audiences saw stewarts screen persona evolve into a more mature more ambiguous and edgier presence stewart and mann also collaborated on other films outside the western genre the glenn miller story  was critically acclaimed garnering stewart a bafta award nomination and together with the spirit of st louis continued stewarts portrayals of american heroes thunder bay released the same year transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations to a more contemporary setting with stewart as a louisiana oil driller facing corruption strategic air command released in  allowed stewart to use his experiences in the united states air force on film stewarts starring role in winchester  was also a turning point in hollywood universal studios who wanted stewart to appear in both that film and harvey balked at his  asking price his agent lew wasserman brokered an alternate deal in which stewart would appear in both films for no pay in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval stewart ended up earning about  for winchester  alone hollywoods other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business which further undermined the decaying studio system the second collaboration to define stewarts career in the s was with director alfred hitchcock like mann hitchcock uncovered new depths to stewarts acting showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires stewarts first movie with hitchcock was the technologically innovative  film rope shot in long real time takes rear window  was one of four films stewart made with alfred hitchcock stewart became the highestgrossing star of  as a result the two collaborated for the second of four times on the  hit rear window widely considered one of hitchcocks masterpieces stewart portrays photographer lb jeff jeffries loosely based on life photographer robert capa who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg jeffries gets into more than he can handle however when he believes he has witnessed a salesman raymond burr commit a murder and when his glamorous girlfriend grace kelly at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery limited by his wheelchair stewart is led by hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses it was a landmark year for stewart becoming the highest grossing actor of  and the most popular hollywood star in the world displacing john wayne hitchcock and stewart formed a corporation

former police investigator suffering from acrophobia who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing scotties obsession inevitably leads to the destruction of everything he once had and believed in though the film is widely considered a classic today vertigo met with very mixed reviews and poor boxoffice receipts upon its release and marked the last collaboration between stewart and hitchcock the director reportedly blamed the films failure on stewart looking too old to be kim novaks love interest and cast cary grant as roger thornhill in north by northwest  a role stewart had

campaigned for stewart to be her leading man in the  romantic comedy next time we love she rehearsed extensively with him having a noticeable effect on his confidence she encouraged stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style stewart was enjoying hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage as he worked six days a week in the mgm factory in  he acquired bigtime agent leland hayward who would eventually marry sullavan hayward started to chart stewarts career deciding that the best path for him was through loanouts to other studios prewar successedit frank capras comedy you cant take it with you  was one of the films that brought stewart widespread attention in  stewart had a brief tumultuous romance

loaned out to columbia pictures to star in you cant take it with you capra had been impressed by stewarts minor role in navy blue and gold  the director had recently completed several well received films including it happened one night  and was looking for the right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in capras films such as clark gable ronald colman and gary cooper did not quite fit not only was stewart just what he was looking for but capra also found stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing later capra commented i think hes probably the best actor whos ever hit the screen you cant take it with you starring capras favorite actress comedian jean arthur won the  best picture academy award the following year saw stewart work with capra and

leading roles between movies stewart began a radio career and became a distinctive voice on the lux radio theaters the screen guild theater and other shows so wellknown had his slow drawl become that

by a chimpanzee in the documentary film james stewart a wonderful life  hosted by johnny carson stewart said that he went back to westerns in  in part because of the string of flops he returned to the

his westerns cary grant said of stewarts acting technique he had the ability to talk naturally he knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and its not always so easy to get a thought out it took a little time for the sound men to get used to him but he had an enormous impact and then some years later marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that jimmy did it first collaborations with hitchcock and mannedit in stewarts collaborations with director anthony mann he entered the realm of the western stewarts first appearance in a film directed by mann came with the  western winchester  in choosing mann after first choice fritz lang declined stewart cemented a powerful partnership the film which became a boxoffice hit upon its release set the pattern for their future collaborations in it stewart is a tough revengeful sharpshooter the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands until the showdown between stewart and his brother stephen mcnally stewart made eight films for director anthony mann five of them were westerns including the naked spur  other stewart–mann westerns such as bend of the river  the naked spur  the far country  and the man from laramie  were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the american west frequently the films featured stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption while facing corrupt cattlemen ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it the stewart–mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the s and remain popular today for their grittier more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre audiences saw stewarts screen persona evolve into a more mature more ambiguous and edgier presence stewart and mann also collaborated on other films outside the western genre the glenn miller story  was critically acclaimed garnering stewart a bafta award nomination and together with the spirit of st louis continued stewarts portrayals of american heroes thunder bay released the same year transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations to a

wasserman brokered an alternate deal in which stewart would appear in both films for no pay in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval stewart ended up earning about  for winchester  alone hollywoods other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business which further undermined the decaying studio system the second collaboration to define stewarts career in the s was with director alfred hitchcock like mann hitchcock uncovered new depths to stewarts acting showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires stewarts first movie with hitchcock was the technologically innovative  film rope shot in long real time takes rear window  was one of four films stewart made with alfred hitchcock stewart became the

his westerns cary grant said of stewarts acting technique he had the ability to talk naturally he knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and its not always so easy to get a thought out it took a little time for the sound men to get used to him but he had an enormous impact and then some years later marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that jimmy did it first collaborations with hitchcock and mannedit in stewarts collaborations with director anthony mann he entered the realm of the western stewarts first appearance in a film directed by mann came with the  western winchester  in choosing mann after first choice fritz lang declined stewart cemented a powerful partnership the film which became a boxoffice hit upon its

bend of the river  the naked spur  the far country  and the man from laramie  were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the american west frequently the films featured stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption while facing corrupt cattlemen ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it the stewart–mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the s and remain popular today for their grittier more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre audiences saw stewarts screen persona evolve into a more mature more ambiguous and edgier presence stewart and mann also collaborated on other films outside the western genre the glenn miller story  was critically acclaimed garnering stewart a bafta award

wasserman brokered an alternate deal in which stewart would appear in both films for no pay in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval stewart ended up earning about  for winchester  alone hollywoods other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business which further undermined the decaying studio system the second collaboration to define stewarts career in the s was with director alfred hitchcock like mann hitchcock uncovered new depths to stewarts acting showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires stewarts first movie with hitchcock was the technologically innovative  film rope shot in long real time takes rear window  was one of four films stewart made with alfred hitchcock stewart became the

blatantly intolerant and bigoted lee falls flat on his face making any genuinely tolerant leftofcentre liberals so horrified that they simply could not laugh in short if youre a bigoted socialist

it seems contrived as does lees a lot of the time to get lee you have to share that same conceited immature arrogance common to all lefties really anyone talking like they are somehow smart for getting lee and you need a higher intellect to grasp him whereas you have to be a moron to appreciate the likes of macintyre is just a gullible idiot who has fallen for a deliberately crafted and honed comedy act when someone can make humour of of real life we can all relate to its not an act like lees is but theyre just genuinely funny  underground youtube stewart lee  is he not just another

annoying  vicki fran twitter consistenly dreadful his slow lazy delivery its not particularly funny from my point of view for instance the rappar joke a few weeks ago had some initial laughs but he dragged it on for far too long often repeating himself after long silences he doesnt interact with the audience which is a major negaitve giving how close he is to them during the show and looking straight at the camera during it to try and engage with the audience at home is needless and desperate without doubt the joke he done lying on his back was the worst i was embarressed for him by the end he doesnt fall into any particular categories he is not edgy enough to shock the audience and he lacks persona and stage presence not creative enought to preach a political mantra or try something that hasnt been done hundreds of times by different comedians and he doesnt have any angle beside the boring grumpy middle aged man and he is not fat he should stop saying that he is the sketches

went out in the street and asked a hundred people about him youd be hard pressed to find a handful whod even heard of the miserable coconut never mind think he was funny i saw him on an old  out of  cats repeat the other day he hardly made a contribution just sitting there partly looking out of his depth and embarrassed to be there exposed as talentless and partly with a smug look on his fat ugly mug the only few people who even claim to rate him are the usual crowd who think he may in some way be clever and so by claiming to like the unfunny twonk somehow raises their own status

about stewart lee sometimes i think hes quite funny but most of the time overwhelmingly smug  mousey twitter i watched this dvd after seeing a praise filled recommendation from dara obriain the irish comic and i usually check the amazon reviews of something as well especially if it evokes a strong reaction i was surprised to see no negative reviews for this so im going to add this one in the hopes that it might be of use to like minded comedy fans in a nutshell it was the worst comedy show ive ever ever sat through that i can remember anyway what could explain it i wondered to myself i clearly like dara obriains comedy why did this not appeal to me well i think whats happened is this a comedian knows comedy so if you present a and b and c together the comedian can probably immediately see how they fit together even if hes never heard the joke before we also know that laughing is a result of the unexpected stewart lee seems to put together a and b and c in unexpected ways this means comedians might find it funny but the general public would find utterly unfunny to give an analogy picasso could actually paint really really well almost photographic quality it was only when he broke all the rules of painting that he became famous though and people said he was a genius but if all you saw was his messed up paintings of women with a nose where their ear should be you could be forgiven for saying this guy cant paint why is he famous stewart lee i think might be the picasso of comics he didnt make me laugh but professional comics can probably appreciate it and laugh or whatever of course that could all be rubbish maybe hes hilarious and i just dont get it but i dont personally see much difference between a guy who studiously and ironically pretends not to be funny and pretends to have a comedic routine fall apart on stage and pretends to restart the show and a guy who simply is not funny and whos comedic routine falls apart and has to restart the show  john r

from the jack dee school of unfunny monotone comments that are just comments not funny comments or ones you agree with most of the laughter comes across as sympathy wow this fella is really boring and as funny as my cat eating whiskers i think stewart lee is a total cock unfunny as a dose of the clap and boring as shite and therefore dont watch him he had a go at clarkson for making money off a book he himself makes money off books the comedian had a go at someone else for making money off books and he makes money off books himself he is saying not good for something he does himself  hypocrite an unfunny cock   andyallerton redandwhitekopcom the people who enjoy his comedy also like boring dinner parties socialism even though they are all living the capitalist lifestyle and think

edmonds hall oxford the evidence of this has been carefully sifted out along with his shropshire accent as he has adopted both the speech and cognitive vocabulary and conventions which are the default position of the speakers of estuary english with whom he presumably spends his days during the fist of fun days he made a darkly glamorous if static foil to the far more comedically gifted richard herring but that was then the glamour has long departed  welcome to the club mr lee  and he does not seem to have gained anything in the way of skill from the period working alongside his erstwhile

like it but it all has a whiff of the emporers new clothes for me he has just about managing to maintain his status to a level where you actually remember who he is since that awful lee and herring

miserable whiningvoiced cunt bernard manning on the right stewart lee on the left bury them all together dead or alive and leave us with the genuinely funny people  mr dogshit bta i think manning and lee have more in common than most would care to admit even if for some his politics make him almost impossible not to like even when he doesnt crack many genuine funnies if manning lazily picks easy targets then what does lee do in relation to the supposed stupidity of americans implicit  were better than americans  a cheap way to win over an audience and his taking the piss out of other comedians is a bit desperate implicit  im better more intelligent than other comedians  and so are you for coming to see me  and people say hes not smug its this suffocatingly self congratulatory aspect of his comedy which stops me enjoying him alongside the sparsity of genuinely funny stuff  then of course theres the suffocating smugness of his fans were clever like stu not like you oiks

vehicle because you wouldnt be able to tell by the content  hatexfactor guardiancouk i understand his comedy its subtle but malicious mockery of heteronomous individuality and takes the smug autonomous likening towards collectivity as is emphasized by material such as attacking those who do not give to charity and people who dont follow his strict and defined moral codes its bullshit he may have some funny lines observations and wordplay but hes still totally closeminded which only fuels his act a smug git who i cant work out if hes just cornered a market in which id respect him or

just not clever enough are usually responses to people who consider him unfunny  cabluigi guardiancouk apart from asher ds book he appeared to have read the first page of chris moyles difficult second book and there was no evidence that he had read anything at all of the others he mentioned clarkson brand brown rowling browns literary construction lends itself to being battered he writes as if his prose is converted from stage directions but lee just made up a line a funny line yes but that doesnt make it intelligent criticism it just makes it a sneery oneliner from a comedian who didnt bother to research his material he didnt actually refer to the content of my booky wook i havent read it either but then im not the one claiming intellectual superiority by dismissing it purely on the basis of its title or the harry potter series or the clarkson books that just leaves the asher d book which he did seem to have read and on which subject he actually was quite intelligent and funny â€“ though the sausageonfork thing was a rather embarrassing lapse into referenceinplaceofactualjoke and the chris moyles book what does lee attack moyles for not his literary construction not his factual veracity not his underlying political leanings but knowing and admitting to his own limitations i dont buy this theory that lees rant is any less reactionary than those of the grumpy old men its sneering posturing made from a position of ignorance aiming at easy targets and missing them he really has become a lazy comedy slag  alex gray offthetellycom intellectual pretensions aside for a

true he is a genius i heard him interviewed by clive anderson on a r review programme anderson was enthusiastic about lees recent gigs and upcoming new shows and lee lapped up the attention then anderson brought up a personal attack by lee on fellow funny man russell brand during one of lees stand up shows apparently during this attack lee quoted brand the quote demonstrating that brand is an immoral shitty worthless excuse for a human being and not the intellectually and morally superior experimental kind of individual that lee is unfortunately anderson reveals lee misquoted brand and so changed the entire meaning of what brand had originally said so far so youvenotdoneyourresearch lees true genius shone through moments later though when anderson put it to him that he had deliberately misquoted brand and so was not just a bit lax but actively dishonest well squirmed lee when youre on stageperforming i meanyoure not really being yourself andiwanted to show this by quoting something

and says that he hopes that richard dies it certainly is not funny i was at school with both of them and i know why lee is so bitter about richard richard has always been a thoroughly nice chap he is unbelievably kind and always stuck up for people who were being bullied his artistic skills are fantastic and he was always way ahead of everyone else in terms of having a mature outlook however the senior school we went to in  was extremely oldfashioned and had an awful macho culture richard disliked it from the start lee was at least two years older than richard and a typical arrogant poshboy i am certan he never knew richard at all lee always arrogantly thought he was going to be a big star and is now very bitter that an unacademic downtoearth character like richard is a wellloved superstar

funny in his tubby middle class knowing way but to be fair his robbie williamsesque habitual selfdeprecation stinks of a desperate need to preempt and avoid criticism of any kind and is unfortunate if only he could let it go as is so true with williams and simply let people make their minds up without the immense childlike immaturity of trying to appear so cool about it he would be not only more likeable but just a much better comedian he would have a witty and clever reply even to this though no doubt poor stu  jmr guardiancouk whats happened to stewart lee he was hilarious back in the s now

funny arent intelligent enough to get his humour since when has being smug boring spiteful and not to mention extremely fucking creepy been the height of hilarity they can keep him the weirdo bastards solely put on this earth to condescend the absolute fuck out of anyone thats stupid enough to listen mainly liberals who like him believe their smarter than everyone else i remember seeing this cock on  out  cats once not a great show i know although i quite enjoy watching sean lock on it everytime he spoke he fell flat on his arse it was so amusing watching him be outwitted by the very type of people he regulary deems witless he went on to say that it was one of the lowest points of his career not because he made himself look like a prick oh no but because he wants people to believe hes to good for a show of that nature it pains me to say it bit i think im witnessing someone whos even more undeservedly aggrandized than even bill fucking hicks is hes lucky that theres people stupid enough out there that will settle for someone like him who cannot for the life of him muster up the main ingredient that someone in his position should have the ability to make others laugh instead he gives them nastiness bitterness huge amounts of snobbery and one great big condescension appalling beyond belief ive been unfortunate enough to pay money to watch this talentless buffoon he had this part of his act whereby he held an vinyl record above his head repeating the title the multitude lapped it up as insecure in their intellect as lee himself only a fucking moron would put up with being patronised to fuck by such a unfunny clearly bitter out of date prick such as this s fucking throw back theres no intelligence required for this onslaught of pure cuntishness he tells what he thinks is a joke then has the nerve to turns smugly to his audience and practically ask what type of joke it is and whether its funny again thinking he gets something everyone else doesnt talk about vilifying the very people that pay for his meaningless existence its not their job to be judged its yours you useless fucking humour vacuum hes a cunt  guest dontstartmeoffcom he is the comedian every guardian journalist can relate to smug egotistical and selfcontented  jim guardiancouk i know this guy not well but i can in fact confirm that he is a cock  ive spoken to him several times in the past at various gettogethers although not recently and he is a bit of a pillock he used to go out with my wifes cousin he came up a few times for xmas and one or two other things i found him to be a little condescending and a bit arrogant i think it must be a thing with people who become famous whereby they automatically think they are superior to you just cos theyve been on telly anyway theyve split up now and my wifes cousin seems a lot happier id expect him to keep his standup routine seperate from day to day life but then perhaps im expecting too much i like his comedy but as a person hes a bit of an arse  mrbloefeldt readytogocom you can tell that the laughing is uncomfortable laughing they dont know when to laugh but feel they should he thinks hes clever by explaining his own jokes and how they work other comedians could do the same but realise its lazy and crap but with a coating of stewarts smug veneer it becomes intelligent to his audience cunts sucked into the lee vortex of smug who think lee is some military general of comedy who sets trap that allow him the have the last laugh as victory when in fact hes just exploiting daft selfproclaimed comedy connoisseurs who he knows will like anything thats deemed intellectual no matter how many times he mumbles crisps  otis dontstartmeoffcom ah mr lee is doing postmodernist comedy not only does he tell a joke he then asks the audience whether the joke is funnyoffensiveironicslapstick  or just crap so now standup turns on its head by vilifying the audience for laughingnot laughing at a particular time during the performance hmm like prog rock which disappeared up its own arsehole or conceptual art which just relies upon the talentless flagellating the uneducated so standup now moves into realm of not being funny which strokes beard here is er funny ladies and gentlemen and reviewers who think hes the funniest thing on television right now please get a grip or watch some vintage les dawson to see how its really done  scousetone guardiancouk you do a  minute routine on extreme misogyny and then finish it by describe someone as a cunt to get a cheap laugh pathetic hypocrisy and not funny stewart lee is using the word cunt  which is a misogynist word he is a witless hypocritical prick and he isnt funny  danizawa youtube stewart lee seems like hes stuck in a right on era hes not as funny cutting edge or clever as he probably thinks he is he gets some things right but his deire to challenge modern life and society dont quite hit the spot and come over as both studenty and smug he reminds me of that other

watching stewart lee religiously for a few years but season  of comedy vehicle is awful so far he bounds back and forth between smugly denigrating other more commercial standups and selfindulgently whiningbragging that he isnt himself more popular making ironic jokes about his poor audience and venue i know people will insist he is playing a character here but after dozens of references it comes off as extremely bitter sad and misanthropic his criticisms of modern standup would be valid were it not for the fact that more than half of the material is recycled from his old dvds you cant blast

made me laugh but then i dont find totalitarians funny the joke wears off after the first ten million corpses  joesoap the uklibertariancouk the fall and stewart lee have something in common both are beloved of broadsheet journalists and pseuds on the internet but out in the real world you would be hard pressed to find anyone who was even familiar with their work let alone considers themselves a fan  valten guardiacouk drags out that not routine far too long presumably to fill space in this dead lifeless selfimportant show  daviduk youtube stewart lee isnt even funny hes disgusting and i hope they ban him from performing the only thing funny about him is his looks  hammondx richardhammondnet a fun game to play is spot stewart lee using fancy language incorrectly in a slightly cringeworthy and failed attempt to sound extra clever he does it a fair bit often when he improvises it wouldnt bother me but when his routines and fans make proclamations about how articulate sharp and wellread he is it makes me wince a little  greyztone youtube i dont hate stewart lee but i do hate his fans he has come to represent this kind of smug superiority of the lower middle class with these strawman arguments turned into fairly poor jokes he does seem like a very nice and quite smart guy but there is a reason that only people who are a bit like him like him hes incredibly pedestrian and mediocore  torotrototo guardiancouk personally i find this way too laboured and smug and most importantly not particularly funnny given its his career its natural not clever clever very vogue at the moment with the guardian readers cant do wrong apparently until the next great middle class wannne be different joy thing comes along  johnanthonyp youtube i have just returned from viewing the sensation that is stewart lee now i am being ironic and sarcastic there is nothing sensational about stewart lee the reviews i have read have put him somewhere between a comedy genius and a funny grumpy old man to be honest he isnt and i would advise anyone who isnt a fan to not bother seeing his show on a whim his innane ramblings are neither informed funny ironic or angry everything is forced in his delivery his jokes come at a rate of  every  mins  seconds and even they are only of sniggering quality he specialises in a type of story that apparently reflect his intelligence and wit instead i ended up feeling sorry for his wife and son who have to spend sunday afternoon with someone who thinks they are funny i originally thought i was being obtuse in the first  minutes of the show as a couple of people around me quite literally burst with side splitting laughter to jokes that were so innane i was wondering if i was too stupid to understand then i started to think maybe the manager of the joint had got a stewart lee mask and given it to the stage hand and told him to get out there and do his best due to the inappropriate forced and unfunny delivery very disappointed  dino spoonfedcom i dont think lee could make funny tv even if he let himself be kicked in the balls repeatedly for  minutes  lent percenttv hes as funny as cow sht  jeff faa faa vauxhallownersnetworkcouk reminds me of david brent what a sad middle aged twat   youtube so i was persuaded by someone to go and see stuart lee one half of former comedy duo lee and herring last night but it ended in bitter disappointment so to

middle classed idiot what ever to just being yourself without some loser telling you what to say or think if i dont like or agree with well that is just to fing bad so put that in your filthy bong and smoke it no one and i mean has the right to tell me or anyone what to believe or think so cram it with walnuts or if that doesnt do it find another way pc thugs are nazis  thepast youtube lee leaves me completely cold its like watching ernie wise soldiering on decades after the funny one has died or the bass player of a s pop band playing a workingmens club in barnsley lifeaffirming it aint theres more joy in a viz knob gag or five seconds of frankie boyle  yes sir there is a vegetarian option you can fuck off  than a miserable  minutes spent in the company of stewart lee if you have to analyse comedy it aint comedy its not big its not clever and it sure as shit isnt comedy  merperson guardiancouk he came th in the greatest stand ups of all time poll shown on ch the other month yes i know its a fiddle  but still if you went out in the street and asked a hundred people about him youd be hard pressed to find a handful whod even heard of the miserable cnt never mind think he was funny the only few people who even claim to rate him are the usual crowd who think he may in some way be clever and so by claiming to like the unfunny twt somehow raises their own status hs face says it all really  hes got a twat face  voiceofreason totalfootballforumscouk stewart lee funny i must be in a parallel universe ten minutes of last weeks show was enough for me  sansrife guardiancouk spineless liberal faggot  mcbathtub youtube hes not gay hes just british  stud youtube this isnt satire it is shit  rincewind youtube not as clever or as funny as he thinks he is really just smug and elitist with the odd laugh as a byproduct  firetotheworks dooyoucouk people who like stewart lee are arrogant self righteous cunts  wallace youtube stewart lee is not funny fact whether i personally find him funny is neither here nor there i could also say les dennis is unfunny  it might be my opinion but its also more importantly a scientifically proven fact a good indicator of whether something is funny is whther it makes people laugh and considering the paying audience at his shows rarely laugh i think thats a fair indicator that he is not funny i saw his stand up live and you could hear a pin drop he may be clever cutting subtle absurd different etc etcbut hes just not that funny reminds me of a comedian called mark thomas who also forgot to be funny and was more concerned with being intelligent clever and different stewart lee fans dont have a sense of humour case rested stewart lee gives smug tedious people hope that other people find them anything but smug and tedious  hnic guardiancouk who is this old gimmer and what is he blabbering on about he is not funny and he whispers  marshalllucky youtube what an unfunny fuck  biffjohnson youtube its his whole intelligent

guff for white middle aged men frustrated by their lack of achievement   white eyed guardiancouk he is soooooooooooo fucking dull  spr youtube stewart lee is a despicable student union throwback and the idea that anyone would look to him for material is horrifying indeed i saw him live not too long ago and he still had faded black jeans dm shoes and that stupid morrissey quiff like the superannuated indie kid he is  i am nice guardiancouk bernard manning just happened to be well talented and he was not right up his own arsehole like lee is   guest hagen dontstartmeoffcom i took my

standing on stage and reading aloud from the instruction booklet he got with his microphone theyd still be rolloing in the aisles such is the devotion of his devotees  jabjabmove youtube this is not funny and what is he saying  sha youtube shit  sexpistols youtube very vogue at the moment with the guardian readers cant do wrong apparently until the next great middle class wannne be different joy thing comes alongpersonally i find him way too laboured and smug and most importantly not particularly funnny given its his career  jonathanyp youtube ive tried to listen to stewart but because i didnt go to private school  oxford i feel he has a air of superiorty sorry if thats spelt wrong no bodys opion or veiws matter thats what you call a middle class twat  rightwing youtube i saw his shows was described as comedy and it looked like some sort of stand up but i watched it and couldnt for the life of me find the comical part of the show perhaps it was some sort of ironic comedy thats

youtube you really call this crap intelligent juvenile adulthumour stupid   finnsia youtube im a comedian and im better than this guy no wonder hes unknown in the uk its just not up to standard  its tired derivative vapid and tedious  come on stewart youve been doing the same routine since   rainbowchild youtube i disagree with stewart lee i believe morality is derived from our evolution so it is fixed  or at least hasnt changed since ancestral times perception of what is morally right may fluctuate throughout our history but i think there is a rational and absolute morality at the core of it  svelter youtube ive always thought of stewart lees comedy as doing the opposite of what really good comedy should do he essentially uses comedy to browbeat people in to agreeing with his rather dogmatic left wing political points of view its as though hes essentially taking what is the sort of prevailing politically correct dogma of his generation and aggressively ridiculing anyone who doesnt sign up to it using comedy as an instrument to enforce conformity not as a means of subversion hes a red faced man jabbing his finger in my face because i dont agree with him he may as well be playing to an empty room for all the concessions he makes to the audience his refusal to concede to the audience is part of an ongoing desire to be taken seriously but someone who wants to be taken so seriously is quite hard to take seriously  toby young a good read bbc radio  march  he seems to have spent an awful lot of time looking for negative comments about himself as hes going through one of his most successful periods in a long time i assume this is a desperate attempt to convince himself that he is still an outsider  danger man cookedandbombedcouk i am a middleaged man and i take my sense of humour very seriously laughter is often the only real let up from embracing my deep disappointment in myself my loved ones and my general situation as a result i feel strongly engaged in the issue of who has the right to be paid to make me laugh even if theyre being paid to make other people laugh even if other people have paid them to make them laugh i feel that as someone who is capable of laughter i am much like a tax payer a stakeholder in the laughter industry and have a burning sense of entitlement to express my opinions on any comedy anywhere i will keep on doing so with more and more rage until i die and no one will have paid attention except other men with slightly differing but no less forcefully expressed resentments and when i die then someone somewhere will be sorry or something  brace guardiancouk haha i do hope hes aware of our site i think it would really get to him if he did hed shit his high almighty y fronts everytime hes charactor got a good kicking on
