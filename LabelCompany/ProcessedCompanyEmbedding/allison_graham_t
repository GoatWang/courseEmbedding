in egypt mean for the us the answer is a lot more complicated than it might seem egypt is important to the us for a number of reasons topping the list is oil and the flow of oil for which the suez canal is an important transit conduit there is no reason to believe that a successor to the mubarak government would interrupt the flow of oil but you could imagine events in the area that could interrupt the flow and we’re seeing this concern reflected in the markets there is also the concern that what is happening in egypt is contagious and that it could lead to instability in other seemingly analogous states—the most important of which is saudi arabia there are regions in which the governments seem very sclerotic the people running them seem old the youth vote seems large and the number of educated citizens who don’t seem adequately challenged seems to be growing such elements characterize quite a number of states in the region including those that are important to the us for various reasons egypt has been a major ally of the us when it comes to relations with israel where the resulting peace though cold has created a stable border and is thus considered one of the great achievements of the last many decades in the role of counterterrorism egypt has been a significant and cooperative ally on questions about hamas alqaida or hezbollah finally with respect to governance egypt is dealing with an autocratic regime that significantly restricts the political rights of the population this has been a problem for the us as it directly conflicts with american objectives and rhetoric nevertheless such issues are of a lesser concern in the hierarchy of interests as things like oil attract greater attention i suspect that peaceful relations between egypt and israel would be sustained a new egyptian government of any stripe will have so much to do that it will not want to take on any additional problems on the other hand egypt’s current mix finds organized groups like the muslim brotherhood the brotherhood’s recent statements have been more internationally acceptable but traditionally they have had quite strong and different views with respect to israel as you can imagine if a muslim brotherhood group emerges after whatever process of transition egypt undergoes such a group might maintain a contrary view the best way to think about the issue is to consider alternative futures one possibility is that mubarak and the current regime will survive i’d say this is very unlikely though with only about a five to ten percent chance of happening a second possibility is that a transitional process will take place resulting in an emerging democratic government i’d say that this second alternative is the most hopeful but not the most likely scenario another scenario features a tumultuous process in which a more or less participatory and democratic system emerges if this scenario were to play out i would bet on the most organized groups emerging as leaders in this case the most organized group is the military which means that we would see the emergence of a militarydominated regime with a civilian face that would be a good outcome as far as the us is concerned a variation of that scenario is the possibility that the muslim brotherhood could step up to take control of the government an outcome that would present its own opportunities and risks the key idea that we should take away from this is that future developments are uncertain and that it is entirely possible to describe an outcome that looks more like iran —though i don’t think such an outcome is likely think about ayatollah khomeini in paris until the iranian revolution lenin going home to russia in a singlecarriage train true those situations weren’t exactly like the one happening now but history reminds us that outcomes are often quite different from the ones people anticipate—and that looking at the aspirations that have spurred a revolution is hardly a good way to predict what the outcomes will actually beallison graham t jr  “the costs of america’s choices” publishers versionabstractamericas last  years might be called “the decade the locusts ate’’ a nation

it is no accident that the united states has not suffered further megaterrorist attacks the remarkable intelligence and special forces capabilities demonstrated in the operation that killed osama bin laden suggest how far we have come but the central storyline of the decade focuses on two choices made by president george w bush  his decision to go to war with iraq and his commitment to cut taxes especially for wealthy americans and thus not to pay for the wars in iraq and afghanistan the cost of his decision to go to war with iraq is measured in  american deaths  americans gravely wounded and a monetary cost of  trillion bush justified his decision to attack iraq on the grounds that saddam hussein might arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction arguing that “ hijackers armed by saddam hussein…could bring a day of horror like none we have ever known’’ in retrospect even bush supporters agree that we went to war on false premises—since we now know that saddam had no chemical or biological weapons suppose however that chemical weapons had been found in iraq would that have made bush’s choice a wise decision what about the many other states that had chemical or biological weapons that could have been transferred to al qaeda for example libya or syria or iran what about the state that unquestionably had an advanced nuclear weapons program north korea which took advantage of the us preoccupation with iraq to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons and conduct its first nuclear weapons test as for cutting taxes for the wealthy bush’s decision left the nation with a widening gap between government revenues and its expenditures brute facts are hard to ignore having entered office with a budgetary surplus that the cbo projected would total  trillion through  bush left office with an annual deficit of over  trillion that the cbo projected would grow to  trillion over the next decade finally and most difficult to assess are opportunity costs what could be

 when defeat at the hands of the british occupying boston seemed almost certain the general commanding american forces george washington observed “perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages’’allison graham t jr  “obama should test iran’s nuclear offer” publishers versionabstractpresident obama should take a page from ronald reagan’s playbook in winning the final inning of the cold war obama can challenge president mahmoud ahmadinejad to put his enriched uranium where his mouth is—by stopping all iranian enrichment of uranium beyond the  percent level a quartercentury ago soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was touting a new “glasnost” openness president reagan went to berlin and called on gorbachev to “tear down this wall” two years later the berlin wall came tumbling down and shortly thereafter the soviet “evil empire” fell as well while in new york for the opening of the un general assembly in september ahmadinejad on three occasions made an unambiguous offer he said iran would stop all enrichment of uranium beyond the levels used in civilian power plants—if his country is able to buy specialized fuel enriched at  percent for use in its research reactor that produces medical isotopes to treat cancer patients obama should seize this proposal and send negotiators straightaway to hammer out specifics iran has been enriching uranium since  and it has accumulated a stockpile of uranium enriched at up to  percent sufficient after further enrichment for several nuclear bombs iran is also producing  percent material every day and it announced in june that it planned to triple its output halting iran’s current production of  percent material and its projected growth would be significant a stockpile of uranium enriched at  percent shrinks the potential timeline for breaking out to bomb material from months to weeks in effect having uranium enriched at  percent takes iran  yards along the football field to bombgrade material pushing it back below  percent would effectively move tehran back to the yard line  much farther from the goal of bombgrade material even more important extracting from iran a commitment to a bright red line capping enrichment at  percent would stop the islamic republic from advancing on its current path to  percent enrichment and then  percent stopping iran from enriching beyond  percent is not in itself a “solution” to its nuclear threat nor was reagan’s proposal to gorbachev the question for reagan was whether we would be better off with the berlin wall or without it iran today is the most sanctioned member of the united nations it has been the target of five security council resolutions since  demanding that it suspend all uranium enrichment the united states and europe have organized their own tougher economic sanctions forbidding businesses from trading with iranian companies and limiting iran’s access to financial markets but iran does not require the permission of the united nations or for that matter the united states to advance its nuclear program within its borders nor are current or future sanctions likely to dissuade iran from progressing steadily toward a nuclear weapon so far obama has essentially continued the bush administration’s policy toward iran with one addition an authentic offer from the start of his administration to begin negotiations negotiations however have not been feasible because of sharp divisions within iran those rifts were exacerbated after the june  elections in which iran’s ruling powers supreme leader ayatollah ali khamanei ahmadinejad and the revolutionary guard rigged the presidential vote and then moved to suppress the opposition green movement protests in the last two years they have tightened control over their society enter ahmadinejad’s proposal to stop all enrichment at the  percent level—without preconditions although differences between ahmadinejad and the supreme leader have become evident the united states should pay attention to the president’s offer arguments against testing the offer are easy to make an embattled ahmadinejad may not be able to deliver iran will use negotiations to seek to relax or escape current sanctions if a deal were reached it would be more difficult to win international support for the next round of sanctions an agreement that stops only the  percent enrichment could imply a degree of acceptance of iran’s ongoing enrichment up to  percent recognizing all of these negatives however the policy question remains would the united states be better off with iran enriching its uranium to  percent or without it president obama should act now to test ahmadinejad’s wordnye joseph s jr stephen m walt and jr allison graham t  “what role should the us play in middle east”

graham t jr  nuclear terrorism the ultimate preventable catastrophe macmillan publishers versionabstracta founding dean of harvards john f kennedy school of government allison applies a long distinguished career in government and academia to this sobering—indeed frightening—presentation of us vulnerability to a terrorist nuclear attack while he begins by asserting such an attack is preventable the balance of his text is anything but reassuring allison begins by describing the broad spectrum of groups who could intend a nuclear strike against the us they range from an alqaeda with its own manhattan project to small and determined doomsday cults their tools can include a broad spectrum of weapons either stolen or homemade from raw materials increasingly available worldwide once terrorists acquire a nuclear bomb allison argues its delivery to an american target may be almost impossible to stop under current security measures the bush administration correct in waging war against nuclear terrorism has not he says yet developed a comprehensive counter strategy arguing that the only way to eliminate nuclear terrorisms threat is to lock down the weapons at the source allison recommends nothing less than a new international order based on no insecure nuclear material no new facilities for processing uranium or enriching plutonium and no new nuclear states those policies allison believes do not stretch beyond the achievable if pursued by a combination of quid pro quos and intimidation in an international context of negotiation and a us foreign policy he describes as humble a humble policy in turn will facilitate building a world alliance against nuclear terrorism and acquiring the intelligence necessary for success against prospective nuclear terrorists it will also require time money and effort like the cold war the war on nuclear terrorism will probably be a long struggle in the twilight but no student of the fact allison asserts doubts that another major terrorist attack is in the offing we do not have the luxury he declares of hoping the beast will simply go awayallison graham t jr  “a failure to imagine the worst” foreign policy publishers versionallison graham t jr  “in afghanistan kerry keeps us goals modest” publishers versionabstractpresident obama confronts the most fateful foreign policy decision so far of his administration rapidly deteriorating security in afghanistan the postelection political crisis in kabul highlighted by abdullah abdullah’s decision to drop out of the runoff vote and general stanley mcchrystal’s request for  troops rightly spurred obama to call a timeout for reflection over the past eight weeks in a process with little precedent in american presidential decisionmaking the president and his advisers have held more than a halfdozen noholdsbarred seminars examining and reexamining every dimension of this challengereduced to a single bottom line obama must decide whether to accept the recommendation of his chosen military commander in the field to americanize this war mcchrystal’s call for more troops would expand us forces in afghanistan to more than  in order to execute what he terms a “classic counterinsurgency campaign’’meanwhile senator john kerry chairman of the senate foreign relations committee delivered a major speech last week summarizing his own analysis of the issue and offering advice about the president’s choices the judgments are nuanced but no more so than the realitieson the bottom line question  yes or no on mcchrystal’s request—kerry says no he argues that mcchrystal reaches “too far too fast’’ kerry recommends that further troop increases must meet three conditions reliable afghan troops to partner with american forces local political leaders and civilian advisers to speed development truth be told none of these three will be in place soonkerry’s analysis begins with the most important consideration us national interests what should americans care about here what matters more than other things that matter kerry says pakistan—not afghanistan his focal question about afghanistan is how developments there impact pakistan over the past months he has led efforts to spotlight the anomaly that allocates  times more american time and resources to afghanistan when our much larger interests lie in pakistan thanks to his efforts with senator richard lugar the united states has committed ½ billion over five years to help stabilize this nucleararmed nation at risk of becoming the “epicenter of extremism in the world’’second what are america’s vital interests in afghanistan kerry answers that it is to “prevent the taliban—with their longstanding ties to al qaeda—from once again providing terrorists with an unfettered afghan safe haven’’ period note what this sparse summary does not include nationbuilding of a stable centrallygoverned afghanistan like all americans kerry applauds the progress afghanistan has made in becoming more democratic expanding rights for women building schools none of these however is included in his minimum essentials for successthird he defines success as “the ability to empower and transfer responsibility to afghans as rapidly as possible and achieve a sufficient level of stability to ensure that we can leave behind an afghanistan that is not controlled by al qaeda

crux of which is “limited geographic area…as narrowly focused as possible’’ counterinsurgency’s central objective is to “foster development of effective governance by a legitimate government’’ in

bush echoing bushs judgment that nuclear terrorism is the single most serious threat to american national security ayatollah ali khamenei warned that sooner or later international terrorists will get their hands on nuclear weapons and bring the security of the world…to an endbush has insisted that for the sake of peace the world must not allow iran to have a nuclear weapon unfortunately however as a result of the failure of the bush administrations strategy toward iran today tehran stands seven years further down its path to nuclear weapons than it did on jan   specifically when bush entered office iran had no operational uranium enrichment facilities today as last months international atomic energy agency report documents iran is operating  centrifuges in a cascade that has produced  pounds of lowenriched uranium this is onethird of what is required for irans first nuclear bombthe bush administrations strategy to prevent irans mastering technology for enriching uranium and producing nuclear weapons has been characterized as a diplomatic slow squeeze the administration has hoped that un security council resolutions isolating iran enforced by sanctions would persuade tehran to suspend enrichment activity ironically the iaea chose memorial day to inform its member governments that for the third time iran has stiffed the demands of the security council resolutionin baseball its three strikes and youre out after the undeniable failure of the third security council resolution imposing sanctions to slow irans nuclear program bushs iran strategists should recognize that they have struck outhoping to divert attention from this record the bush administration has further confused the issue with exaggerated rhetorical attacks on those who advocate an alternative strategy of direct diplomacy including negotiations speaking to the israeli knesset on the th anniversary of israels creation bush accused proponents of negotiations with unfriendly regimes of appeasement more diplomatically but equally pointedly in addressing the american israel public affairs committee this week secretary of state condoleezza rice called for another dose of the same medicine the administration has been prescribing and sought to shift the blame to iran asserting that the real question is why wont tehran talk to usfacts are only obliquely relevant to political debate but for the record the charge of appeasement leveled against british prime minister neville chamberlain focused not on his willingness to talk but on his unwillingness to act in the runup to world war ii negotiation was not the issue the question was whether britain and france would act when adolf hitler violated germanys versailles treaty commitmentswinston churchill criticized the governments for capitulating when hitler remilitarized the rhineland arguing that if they had responded there is no doubt that hitler would have been compelled by his own general staff to withdraw…they had only to act to win instead a confident hitler went on to absorb austria and after munich czechoslovakiaif bush recognized the fact that his diplomatic squeeze has failed and asked what he could do in his final eight months to advance us interests in relations with iran he would not have to look beyond his own cabinetin a  report titled iran now is the time for a new approach defense secretary robert gates urged that the united states deal with the current regime rather than wait for it to fall when asked about this recommendation during recent testimony on the hill gates noted that he had been in a happier place thenbut it is clear that gates remains convinced that direct negotiations are imperative for solving the nuclear standoff as he told the academy of american diplomacy last month we need to figure out a way to develop some leverage…and then sit down and talk with themnegotiations are never certain to yield results the alternative a world of nuclear anarchy is of great concern to both nations having seen the results of seven years of nonengagement bush could do his successor—whether democrat or republican—a great favor by proposing to negotiate with iran

rejection of what his opponents called his policies of subservience to the united states an american press that has been virtually unanimous in opposing musharraf will now predictably call for his resignation in favor of genuine democracy since this outcome is a possibility it is essential to ask where a government that accurately reflects the views of pakistani citizens would stand on issues that matter most to americawould such a government follow musharrafs lead as a grudging shotgun ally recall that after the sept   attacks as musharraf tells the story the united states gave him the choice of becoming an ally or being bombed back to the stone agehow vigorously would a new democratic government support the usled war on terrorism in which pakistans army is now fighting al qaeda and its affiliates headquartered in pakistans ungoverned northwest territories would such a government be more likely to cooperate with the united states and nato in the ongoing but faltering war against the taliban in afghanistan recall again that the rise of the taliban took place during the term of musharrafs civilian predecessors including nawaz sharif the leader of one of the parties that won in mondays electionthe answer to each of these questions is as unambiguous as it is uncomfortable a pakistani government whose actions align with its citizens views on these issues would be at loggerheads with the united states over the past year polls have highlighted the sharp decline in musharrafs popularity with his approval ratings dropping to  percent in december several recent polls including ones from the pew global attitudes project the international republican institute and terror free tomorrow echo those sentiments with one showing that  percent of pakistanis want musharraf to immediately resignbut what most american commentators have missed is that however much pakistanis dislike musharraf they are more hostile toward the united states when asked to name the single greatest threat to their country  percent of pakistanis named the united states historic archrival india with whom pakistan has fought five bloody wars was second well behind americaeightynine percent of pakistanis said they disapprove of the us war on terrorism eight in  pakistanis oppose allowing the united states to pursue al qaeda terrorists in their country a similar percentage rejects us pursuit of taliban forces into pakistan in opposing musharraf opposition parties called him busharraf and accused him of being a lackey of the united states in the socalled war on terrorism which they say is a usled war on islamthe us military presence in afghanistan where earlier pakistani governments were the primary sponsors of the taliban is opposed by  percent of pakistanis critics of musharrafs limited cooperation with the usnato campaign should recognize that a government that more closely followed the wishes of its people would be less cooperative in combating the talibanthe united states has two vital national interests in pakistan first to prevent any of pakistans nuclear arsenal and bombmaking materials from being stolen sold or transferred to terrorists second to destroy al qaedas leadership sanctuary and training camps neither interest will be advanced by a transition from the devil we know to the new democratic pakistani governmentfortunately pakistans nuclear weapons are secured by its army the countrys most effective national institution unless the army were destabilized or became substantially disaffected because of extended political instability it will fulfill its custodial responsibilities in contrast a government that truly reflects the current views of the pakistani people is more likely to be an unspoken opponent than an ambiguous ally in the us war against al qaeda and other terrorists in the regionhard as it is to believe osama bin laden is four times as popular among pakistanis as president bush whose approval rating is  percentthat leading us opinion pages generally critical of bushs democracy crusade in iraq should now so uncritically promote democratic shocktherapy as a panacea for pakistans problems is puzzling the inconvenient painful truth is that a truly democratic pakistan would be at least in the foreseeable future less inclined to act in ways that advance urgent american interestsadvocates of instant

a weekend in kennebunkport with two american presidents flummoxed supporters and critics alike over the past year no international leader has been more critical of the president than his russian guestfrom his january state of the union reference to “comrade wolf” to his recent comparison of bushs america to hitlers third reich putin has many chattering about a new cold war moreover in preparing for election of a new parliament in december and new president next march putin has tightened kremlins grip on all instruments of power from the economy to the press why then did bush decide to reward what most american opinion leaders believe he should be condemning senator john mccain for example has called for russia to be evicted from the g club of leading industrial democraciesbush and secretary of state condoleeza rice made the right decision in inviting putin on the basis of a sound assessment of how best to advance american national interests four considerations informed their judgmentfirst hysterics aside russia is not the soviet union and the united states is not entering a new cold warfor four decades the soviet union was americas focal enemy a communist totalitarian government consumed  percent of its gross national product in a militarydominated state whose troops occupied what ronald reagan rightly called an “evil empire”today russias borders have shrunk back to territory controlled by catherine the great  years ago russia now spends  on defense for every  in the american defense budget in short this is not his fathers soviet unionsecond president bush understands that russia is a former superpower struggling to recover its balancefor russia the s were a traumatic roller coaster ride that turned the society upsidedown and inside out over the decade the soviet union disappeared to be replaced by russia and  newly independent states a centrally commanded and controlled economy was destroyed in an economic depression worse than the great american depression and communism was burieda superpower rival of the united states became a supplicant groveling for economic assistance under putin russias economy has grown at  percent per year russias debt has been repaid russia has emerged as a petropowerthird as a fellow politician bush understands the power of public symbolsin both countries baiting the former cold war adversary is politically productive especially in a society that felt humiliated and thus craves to be proud of their country putins readiness to stand up to the worlds sole superpower has given him the highest approval rating among his fellow citizens of any leader in the world today thus especially when cooperating putin is always at pains to describe this in his own term—not as concessions to the united statesfourth and most important as the president stated bluntly at the kennebunkport press conference the united states needs russiasuccess in combating the greatest threats to americans security and wellbeing requires russias active cooperation iran is only the most urgent illustration of the central proposition without deep russian cooperation the united states has no hope of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons nuclear terrorism and nuclear warwords aside putins hidden hand has been extremely helpful in the current bargaining with iran delaying completion of the civilian nuclear reactor at bushehr refusing to supply nuclear fuel to iran and urging iran to accept an arrangement in which fuel for its civilian nuclear reactors would be produced by an international consortium outside iranrussia has joined the united states in three un resolutions calling on iran to suspend enrichment of uranium and enter negotiations as bush underlined at the press conference when the united states and russia stand together iran takes notebush was right to host putin in a setting conducive to serious conversation about how they can block irans acquisition of nuclear bombsin the weeks ahead expect the two countries to move directly to conduct a joint assessment of the iranian threat on the basis of which they produce a joint strategy for stopping iran the unnecessary controversy over missile defenses against nuclear warheads delivered by iranian missiles can readily be resolved in that context since such defenses would be required only if the united states and russia fail to prevent irans acquiring nuclear bombsthe proof of what was achieved at this “lobster summit” will be in russian and american actions in the months ahead but if by this invitation bush solidified putins cooperation as a real partner in stopping iran kennebunkport will be noted by historians as an accomplishment of which two soontobe former presidents can be

opponents tend to “misunderestimate” him could he be misunderestimating his north korean opponent kim jong ilat his recent press conference president bushs exchange with cnn white house correspondent suzanne malveaux left observers scratching their headsmalveaux “four years ago you labeled north korea a member of the ‘axis of evil’ since then its increased its nuclear arsenal its abandoned sixparty talks and now these missile launches…”bush “thats an interesting statement ‘north korea has increased its nuclear arsenal’ can you verify that”malveaux “well intelligence sources say—if youd like to dispute that thats fine”bush “no im not going to dispute im just curious”malveaux “its increased its nuclear capabilities its abandoned sixparty talks and its launched these missiles”bush “yes”malveaux “why shouldnt americans see the us policy regarding north korea as a failed one”unquestionably bush is familiar with the basic facts about north koreas expansion of its arsenal of plutonium during his presidency however his response suggests an extreme case of cognitive dissonance given his image of kim jong il the score in the faceoff between the leader of the worlds most powerful nation and one of the weakest states on the globe does not computethis discrepancy is enhanced by bushs personal distaste for north koreas “dear leader” in pyongyangspeak calling him “a pygmy” whom he “loathes” the president views him as “irrational” and “strange” how then is it possible that in the contest to prevent north koreas acquisition of nuclear weapons the score today is kim jong il  bush unpalatable as they are the brute facts cannot be denied when bush entered office in  north korea had one to two bombs worth of plutonium according to cia estimates that material had been diverted from its yongbyon research reactor during the presidency of george hw bush and reprocessed to extract the plutonium in today according to american intelligence estimates kim jong il has acquired an additional eight bombs worth of plutonium and thus has an arsenal of as many as  weapons furthermore he has restarted his operational production line making two additional bombs of plutonium every yearif one widens the lens to the broader us objectives in its policy toward north korea the bottom line is even worse after taking office in  the bush administration rejected the clinton approach to north korea as a “flagrant failure” and trumpeted a new approach the essence of the bush administrations north korean policy was no north korean nuclear weapons no ambiguity about violations of the terms of the  agreed framework no more missile tests and no rewards to induce better behavior on pyongyangs part before the end of the first year in office this policy had taken the further step to “regime change”in contrast kim jong ils overriding objective has been regime survival including the survival of the dear leader himself and his family in addition to sustaining the regime he wanted money oil and food to keep his desperate economy afloat and the extent that he could get away with it he wanted to produce additional fissile material for additional nuclear weapons as wellmeasured against their respective objectives which of the parties deserves higher marks kim jong il often seems crazy but he may be crazy like a foxgraham allison is director of the belfer

memory many americans comfort themselves with the thought that  was a freak accident or a year flood yesterdays arrest of  suspected terrorists who were in the operational stage of preparation to blow up airplanes en route from britain to the united states serves as another stark wakeup call to the brute fact that so many find so hard to believe there are a large number of people in the world who seriously want to kill usas we applaud the diligence of british security services that unraveled this plot there are deeper questions americans should reflect on why are so many people prepared to give up their own lives to kill americans why are there so many people in the world who support them why do so many people believe that their methods are justifiablea year into the war in iraq secretary of defense donald rumsfeld posed a similar question to his four closest colleagues in the pentagon in a memo that was subsequently leaked about us strategy in the global war on terrorism he asked “are we capturing killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting training and deploying against us”assessing our adversaries numbers dynamically and seeking to understand their motivation clinically is not to sympathize with them but to attempt to design better strategies to defeat them that requires understanding how our actions increase sympathy support and incentives for wouldbe killers as commanders of us forces in iraq have observed if by calling down airstrikes on a house containing one terrorist and  innocents we subtract one terrorist but recruit  replacements we move backward in our missionnine months after  al qaeda announced its goal to kill four million americans as an affiliated website stated “we have the right to kill four million americans—two million of them children—and to exile twice as many and wound and cripple hundreds of thousands” to compensate for the muslims killed by what osama bin laden called the “jewishchristian crusaders”one can only imagine how bin ladens target number is growing as the war in iraq continues and now as israel pursues its campaigns in gaza and lebanonthe capture of the wouldbe plane bombers in london should cause us to reflect on our longerrun strategy for what the president has rightly called the “long war” on terrorism in that war there are today more people who see the united states as the major threat to themselves than there were on  in that war the war in iraq has caused more people around the world to support terrorists who want to kill us clearly we must continue efforts at monitoring disrupting capturing incarcerating or eliminating determined killers but a strategic reassessment of our longerterm strategy for the war on terrorism would highlight at least three areas that require substantial change on our partfirst we must acknowledge that the surest way to generate terrorists is to occupy their territory the french learned this in algeria the israelis in the occupation of lebanon from  to  to the extent that us troops are seen as occupiers in iraq or israeli troops occupiers in lebanon history would predict we motivate terrorists the quiet unadvertised withdrawal of us forces from bases in saudi arabia removed one of bin ladens raison detre to force american and other “crusaders” to remove their troops from arab landssecond we must recognize that most of the actions required to discover and capture terrorist plotters like the “london ” will be taken by other governments—or not at all however great our effort it cannot approach the extent and effectiveness of the british government in britain the saudi government in saudi arabia the pakistani government in its country but gaining their assistance will require greater sensitivity to these governments and their citizens concerns on issues at the top of their agendas to americans who ask why we care that majorities even in allied countries disapprove of the united states and especially the bush administration and believe that america is the greatest threat to international security the answer is that their cooperation in outing a jihadist in their midst may be essential to our securityfinally we must delegitimize terrorism—making it as internationally unacceptable as slavery or piracyas president bush has rightly said we live in a “dangerous world” effectively combating this threat will however require more imagination and harder choices in the long rungraham t alliston jr is a faculty

graham t jr  “were still vulnerable” publishers versionabstractobserving the second anniversary of al qaedas assault on the world trade center and pentagon administration spokesmen sought to highlight progress in the war on terrorism to support president bushs claim that were getting safer every day but if one stands back and asks whether americans are actually safer from terrorist attacks than we were  months ago a serious answer requires a net assessment our safety is a function not only of what our government does but also of changes in our adversaries capabilities and motivationassessing that balance i conclude that the threat of terrorist attacks on america in the year ahead remains at least as high as it was last year consider four fronts in this war the international campaign against al qaeda homeland security preventing nuclear and biological terrorism and iraqin the first  months after the attack america organized an extraordinary worldwide campaign against terrorism universal sympathy for american victims of  led governments and citizens around the world to proclaim solidarity under the banner we are all americans through the un the united states enlisted more than  nations in a global effort to share intelligence information enforce antiterrorist legislation in each local setting and stop terrorists flow of fundsin the past year this global coalition has frayed americas standing in the world has fallen further and faster than at any time in the history of polling when asked recently whom they trust to do the right thing regarding world affairs more pakistanis indonesians and jordanians chose osama bin laden than president bushwhy does this matter the essence of effective counterterrorism is intelligence and police enforcement at the local level the mastermind of al qaedas southeast asian operations was captured in thailand as a result of a tip from suspicious neighbors combined with active cooperation between local thai agents and the cia the hearts and minds of governments and citizens provide either a sympathetic sea in which terrorists swim and hide or alternatively millions of eyes and ears from which terrorists cannot escape although the united states caught three of al qaedas top leaders in the past year bin laden and his secondincommand are still on the lam and al qaeda recruitment is upsecond in defending the american homeland the us government has taken many significant actions most notably the creation of the department of homeland security in time this will yield security dividends but realism requires recognition that in the first year after such disruptive changes capabilities are more likely to decline than increase former senator warren rudmans recent council on foreign relations report finds a shortfall of  billion in priority investments in homeland security over the next five yearsthird the campaign to prevent a nuclear or biological  is failing despite lots of talk north korea is today producing plutonium that could be sold to terrorists for use in a nuclear attack russian and pakistani nuclear weapons and materials remain as vulnerable to theft as they were last year orphaned research reactors in a dozen countries around the world including libya and ghana contain highly enriched uranium sufficient to make a number of nuclear weapons and while saddam no longer rules iraq he has gone missing and with him a sophisticated smuggling network and whatever biological weapons iraq hadwhile the administration rightly recognized the threat of a bioterrorist attack with smallpox or other agents the campaign to protect american citizens flopped the announced goal of vaccinating  first responders against smallpox was recently disbanded after vaccinating fewer than  long term project bioshield will create new vaccines and therapeutics short term the public health systems capacity to identify and respond to bioterrorism remains dangerously inadequateiraq is the wild card analytically iraq was tangential to the immediate war on terrorism the cia found no links between saddam and  and no evidence of iraqi support for terrorist attacks on american targets since the early s but president bushs decision to market war on iraq as a centerpiece of the war on terrorism has now forged an inextricable linkwhile the demonstration of americas military might has surely sobered regimes that wish america harm the administrations incompetence in postwar iraq has attracted both terrorists and jihadi wannabes in what now threatens to become a terrorist incubator akin to afghanistan during soviet occupationfor the year ahead americans are at least as vulnerable to terrorist attacks as we were in the year past after the next megaterrorist attack americans will find our

versionabstractranchers have learned painfully the wisdom of the maxim when pursuing deadly rattlesnakes dont provoke the fatal attack you are aiming to prevent does the bush administrations chosen strategy of publicized preemption risk violating that prescriptionpresident george w bush believes not in this weeks address to the nation the essence of his argument for acting now is that we must hit saddam before he hits us unless we take preemptive action to disarm iraq and eliminate saddam he argued on any given morning saddam could surprise us with a chemical or biological the nations best intelligence analysts disagree as the latest national intelligence estimate declassified this week states unequivocally in the absence of a us attack the likelihood of saddam attacking us with chemical and biological weapons in the foreseeable future is low on the other hand if saddam becomes convinced that we really are about to attack him to topple his regime intelligence analysts conclude the likelihood that he would attack us with chemical or biological weapons is high in sum to prevent an attack the likelihood of which is low the us is taking action that makes the likelihood of that attack highwhich of these conflicting judgments seems more likely to be correct the presidents or the intelligence communitys since the competing bets are driven by strategic logic not secret information let us consider the questionbush presented the basic facts clearly in mondays address we know that saddam has chemical and biological weapons including anthrax and other deadly biological agentsmdashcapable of killing millions we know that iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas we know that he is exploring ways of using these uavs for missions targeting the united states we know that a small container and one terrorist or iraqi intelligence operative could deliver biological agents to an american city we know that those who hate america would be eager to use biological or chemical or nuclear weapons thus we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurringthe issue remains how best to prevent the worst from occurringon the current path for more than a year the bush administration has broadcast its firm intention to change the regime in iraq to kill saddam and everything he holds dear currently the us is positioning military forces in the region in preparation for such an attack a congressional resolution authorizing the president to take all necessary means has been passed shortly thereafter a security council resolution authorizing intrusive inspections and after saddam stiffs inspectors permitting a usled military attack to disarm iraq seems assuredgiven this picture what do we imagine saddam is now planning for us given bushs summary of saddams character evil his history homicidal and his intentions ruthlessly hostile is he likely to go down with a whimper—or a bang will he attack americans here at home has he already dispatched operatives to american cities with biological weapons like smallpox will he attack israel with biological weapons will he infect bases in the region where american troops are preparing to launch an attack upon him if saddams overriding objective is his own survival as we launch or finalize plans to launch an attack that threatens to extinguish him is there any reason to expect him to do less than his best to kill as many americans as possible if the evidence the president cites is correct the logic of the snake hunters maxim would appear to lead inexorably to the national intelligence estimates conclusion conducting a wmd attack against the united states would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with himtherefore what to do if one finds a pair of rattlesnakes in his backyard backing off and hoping they slink away is not the answer nonetheless prudence requires that before attacking a coiled rattler that has no escape route we are as prepared as we can be to blunt its strikepresident bush asked does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons the answer is it depends specifically it depends on whether his offensive capabilities to harm us are growing faster than our capabilities to defend ourselves against the counterattack our action may provokebefore taking action that will likely provoke the very attack we seek to prevent bush should assure americans that our troops in the field and citizens here at home are prepared for the biological and chemical attacks the countrys best intelligence analysts judge to be likely have you gotten your anthrax and
