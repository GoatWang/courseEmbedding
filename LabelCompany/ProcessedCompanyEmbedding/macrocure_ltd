macrocure – macrocure and leap therapeutics skip to content macrocure macrocure and leap therapeutics june   by hernandez an expat in us  post thumbnail an expat in us the first time i thought about this is when i was going to university before i went to arizona i actually have never gone into the us i only heard and saw from internet about american when i was searching about it there are articles about racist in us and so on well those kind of article kind a freaks me out i’m afraid that i will be lonely there since i’m mexican i thought maybe they didn’t like me because i’m not white but when i went to arizona nothing that what i was thinking about happen in arizona everyone is so nice to me even if they knew that i was mexican at the university i got lots of friends from us and even some that isn’t from the us too an expat just like me after what happen in arizona i realize that not all american are racist well maybe there are but not all of them there’s still nice people there being an expat in america have it’s benefits and difficulties the food and drink in the us is available at very low prices especially fast food and there is no shortage of restaurants and food outlets clothes utilities and electrical goods are also cheap the usa does not have an official language but english is the most commonly spoken language and is used by government and federal agencies but there’s actually a large percentage of the population in america speaks spanish this is a direct result of the influx of spanishspeaking immigrants from across the border when it comes to the weather the us is so large that different parts of the country experience different weather patterns much of the eastern coast is plagued by hurricanes and monsoons between august and october however the weather the rest of the year is very pleasant states in the deep south experience hot muggy temperatures with little rain while those states and cities further north have a much more temperate climate with four distinct seasons may   by hernandez maintain your health from your food post thumbnail as a nutritionists i will give you some tips about what you should eat and shouldn’t and why so remember what you eat is what you are about food there are many different types of food around the world with different types of material like meat rice vegetables dairy product and many more of course all of this base material is healthy for our body but if you eat one of it too much it’s not good for our health in life there’s always a balance between good and bad life and dead and so does with food in food it needs balance too between carbohydrate fat protein vitamins minerals and calcium for the body it needs to balance in order to have a healthy and fit body the choices we made about what are going to eat is very important to our body we should add up to a balanced nutritious diet we all have different calorie needs based on our gender age and activity level health conditions can play a role too including if you need to lose weight so even if it just a small choices it may have a great impact for us having a healthy diet has a lot of benefits it can help you lose weight or maintain your desired weight it also can lower your cholesterol and prevent certain health conditions in general a healthy diet keeps your body running on a daily basis so remember always choose the best food for you and keep it balance between the meat potato veggies fruit and milk march   by hernandez relieving stress in new orleans post thumbnail in new orleans there are lots of ways to relief stress after working one of it is to listen to music for me who came from cuba the music here and there is different but i like it though here in new orleans there’s jazz festival it is held during the last weekend of april and the first weekend of may this worldrenowned extravaganza of music food crafts and good living is a mainstay of the new orleans festival calendar attracting both international headliners and local artists new orleans is the hometown of jazz but neither the city nor the genre she birthed are musical museum pieces jazz is the root of american popular music the daddy of rock brother of the blues and not too distant ancestor of hiphop – all styles of music that have defined the beat of global pop for decades all these varieties of music plus a few you may never have heard of are practiced and played here on every corner in any bar every night of the week live music isn’t an event it’s as crucial to the city soundscape as the streetcar bells i am not exaggerating when i say there is either a festival or a parade every week of the year in new orleans sometimes such as during mardi grass or jazz fest it feels like there’s a new party for every hour of the day at almost any celebration in town people engage in masking and use a costume while acting out the satanic side of human behavior january   by hernandez the importance of having an insurance post thumbnail as an expat insurance is absolutely critical and should be one of your top considerations when moving overseas the majority of countries around the world do not offer expatriates free healthcare even in emergencies and rising medical costs around the world entail that a comprehensive international health insurance plan is a must for anyone who is going to move overseas such a thing is necessary to ensure coverage in the if an emergency occurs and it is crucial that all expats take the necessary action to make sure that their health and wellbeing is protected and provided i consider the type of policies that are on the market and highlight some of the areas expats should investigate before taking out a medical or travel insurance policy it is also needed to provide a glossary of important terms so that you can read and understand your contract before you formally agree to the terms and conditions if you or any member of your family has a special medical condition that requires specialist help then you need to ensure that this help will be available in your host country again this should be done before you find yourself living in a strange country with no access to the medical attention you need it is always advisable to visit the doctor before you leave your home country and have a full check up ensure your vaccinations are up to date and that you are in good health you should also pay a visit to the dentist and ensure that your teeth are healthy and in good order so be careful in choosing the right insurance there are a lot of choices that you can do and please read the policy every policy is important so make sure to read all of it and search if there’s any strange or unwanted policy in the contract more security insurance medical health
