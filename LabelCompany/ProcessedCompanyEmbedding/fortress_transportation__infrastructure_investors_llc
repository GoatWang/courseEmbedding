financial condition and results of operations the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help you understand fortress transportation and infrastructure investors llc the company the companys mda should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and with part i item a risk factors and forwardlooking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k overview we own and acquire high quality infrastructure and related equipment that is essential for the transportation of goods and people globally we target assets that on a combined basis generate strong cash flows with potential for earnings growth and asset appreciation we believe that there are a large number of acquisition opportunities in our markets and that our managers expertise and business and financing relationships together with our access to capital will allow us to take advantage of these opportunities we are externally managed by fig llc the manager an affiliate of fortress investment group llc fortress which has a dedicated team of experienced professionals focused on the acquisition of transportation and infrastructure assets since  as of december   we had total consolidated assets of  billion and total equity of  billion in may  the remaining capital commitments of the investors of the onshore fund offshore fund and master gp were called through a series of transactions the master gp contributed its rights to previously undistributed incentive allocations pursuant to the partnership agreement in exchange for the limited partnership interests in the onshore fund and the offshore fund equal to the amount of any such undistributed incentive allocations and  common shares were issued to the onshore fund and offshore fund based on their relative interests in the company in november  the onshore fund and the offshore fund each distributed to their respective limited partners the common shares allocated to their limited partners in accordance with their respective limited partnership agreements on may   we completed an ipo of  million common shares at a price to the public of  per share on june   the underwriters exercised their overallotment option pursuant to which we issued an additional  million shares to such underwriters at the ipo price the company has used and intends to use the net proceeds from the ipo together with other sources of capital and liquidity for the acquisition of new assets in the sectors the company currently invests in as well as to opportunistically acquire assets across the entire transportation and transportationrelated infrastructure and equipment market in addition the company may use such net proceeds for followon investments in existing assets working capital and other general purposes while our strategy permits us to acquire a broad array of transportationrelated assets we are currently active in four sectors where we believe there are meaningful opportunities to deploy capital to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns aviation energy intermodal transport and rail commercial air travel and air freight activity have historically been longterm growth sectors and are tied to the underlying demand for passenger and freight movement we continue to see strong demand for aviation related assets within the energy infrastructure and transportation equipment market we are focused on two subsectors landbased infrastructure and offshore energy service equipment landbased infrastructure refers to facilities that enable the storage unloading loading and movement of crude oil and refined products from producers to end users such as refineries customers of landbased infrastructure typically purchase capacity on a takeorpay basis and the economics of these assets directly relate to the volume of throughput offshore energy service equipment refers to vessels supporting the extraction processing and transportation of oil and natural gas from deposits located beneath the sea floor the recent oil price decline has led to oil and gas companies reducing and deferring spending decisions creating an oversupply of offshore energy assets and in turn lower dayrates utilization and earnings for offshore service companies the intermodal transport market includes the efficient movement of goods throughout multiple modes of transportation making it possible to move cargo from a point of origin to a final destination without repeated unpacking and repacking over the last year the significant drop in commodity prices has led to a decline in new container prices which has led to lower lease rates and residual values rail refers to the railroad industry which has increased its share of freight tonmiles compared to other forms of freight transportation over the past quarter century this infrastructure most of which was originally established over  years ago represents a limited supply of assets and a difficulttoreplicate network we continue to see increased volumes and efficiencies on our network since our investment in cmqr in  operating

feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a
