is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who

directors committee composition sec filings quarterly results latest filings investor faqs clinical trials etrasimod ralinepag apd careers etrasimod  arena pharmaceuticals etrasimod drug candidate for treatment of autoimmune diseases etrasimod apd is an oral next generation selective sp receptor modulator discovered by arena designed to provide systemic and local cell modulation by selectively targeting sp receptor subtypes  and  etrasimod has therapeutic potential in autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis sp receptors have been demonstrated to be involved in the modulation of several biological responses including lymphocyte trafficking from lymph nodes to the peripheral blood by isolating subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes fewer immune cells are available in the circulating blood to effect tissue damage about autoimmune diseases autoimmune diseases are characterized by an inappropriate immune response against substances and tissues that are normally present in the body in an autoimmune reaction a person’s antibodies and immune cells target healthy tissues triggering an inflammatory response reducing the immune andor inflammatory response is an important goal in the treatment of autoimmune disease about ulcerative colitis ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease that affects the large intestine the innermost lining of the large intestine becomes inflamed and ulcers may form on the surface which can cause symptoms such as frequent bowel movements diarrhea and bloody stools the inflammation is usually found in the rectum and can include all or a portion of the colon currently available treatment options have limitations in terms of side effects patient response efficacy and administration we believe that an effective oral selective sp receptor modulator that provides clinical benefits without current limitations has the potential to improve treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis about dermatological conditions of ibd extraintestinal manifestations or eims of inflammatory bowel disease are common in both uc and cd inflammatory manifestations of the skin eyes liver and joints are considered the primary types of eims associated with ibd cutaneous disorders associated with ibd occur in up to  of patients erythema nodosum pyoderma gangrenosum and psoriasis are the most common skin manifestations of ibd in total affecting up to  of the ibd population ibd and these major skin eims in ibd share some common pathogenic mechanisms including t lymphocyte infiltration we believe sp receptor modulation’s ability to sequester lymphocytes should result in fewer immune cells available to affect these inflammatory processes in addition to the potential antiinflammatory benefits resulting from reducing systemic lymphocyte circulation activity on sp and sip are known to exert antiproliferative effects in human keratinocytes the predominant type of cell found in the outermost layer of the skin and inhibit skin dendritic cell migration therefore the potential role of sp receptor modulation in skin eims of ibd might involve both systemic and local dermal mechanisms there are no therapies currently approved specifically for treatment of ibdmediated dermatologic manifestations therefore a significant unmet need remains and we believe that etrasimod may represent a significant opportunity to provide an effective treatment for patients with ibd experiencing dermatologic eim about pyoderma gangrenosum pyoderma gangrenosum or pg is a rare inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful recurrent ulcerations lesions may occur either in the absence of any apparent underlying disorder or in association with other diseases such as uc cd and other conditions diagnosis of pg is based on the history of the underlying disease typical clinical presentation histopathology and exclusion of other diseases that would lead to a similar clinical picture the clinical course can be mild or malignant and chronic or relapsing treatment is challenging and the prognosis of pg remains unpredictable current treatments involve wound care and the use of antiinflammatory agents including antibiotics corticosteroids immunesuppressants and biologics and attempts to target a broad spectrum of immunologic mediators and inflammatory cells including tlymphocytes shown to be involved in pg reduction of lymphocytes by sp receptor modulators such as etrasimod may represent a novel therapeutic approach in pg primary biliary cholangitis primary biliary cholangitis or pbc previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease which is classified as a rare disease progressive bileduct injury from portal and periportal inflammation could result in progressive fibrosis cholangitis and eventually cirrhosis evidence to date suggests that immunological and genetic factors might cause the disease the treatment goal is to slow the progression rate of the disease and to alleviate the symptoms liver transplantation appears to be the only lifesaving procedure for pbc patients inflammation the underlying cause of pbc is believed to be t lymphocyte mediated in research models with etrasimod we have demonstrated modulation of the specific subtypes of t lymphocytes implicated in pbc status ulcerative colitis we are conducting a dose finding randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multinational phase  clinical trial of etrasimod in moderate to severe uc the aim of the trial includes investigating a clear dose response and establishing a clinically meaningful signal for the active arms from placebo the trial is expected to evaluate the effects of etrasimod mg and mg versus placebo on multiple efficacy measures including total mayo score tms clinical remission and clinical response in up to  patients subjects from this study have the possibility to continue after  weeks in an open label extension study for up to  weeks with the focus on safety and maintenance of therapeutic effect dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations of ibd we are conducting a phase a proof of concept openlabel study evaluating the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in ibd patients with active dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations the objective is to determine the treatment effect of etrasimod in ibd patients on the clinical improvement of active dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations and to determine the safety profile and tolerability of etrasimod over a week treatment period the study includes patients with ibd experiencing active dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations including psoriasis erythema nodosum and pg pyoderma gangrenosum we are conducting a phase a proof of concept openlabel study to determine the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in patients with pg the objective is to evaluate the efficacy safety and tolerability of etrasimod in patients with pg over a week treatment period the study includes patients with
