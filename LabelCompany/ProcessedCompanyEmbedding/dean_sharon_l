from but she had the curliest reddest hair this side of concord even ellen’s widowed father must not have known for he alone among the stockwells had been a talking man people speculated about an

salon for writers and artists and smuttynose island the scene of a notorious  murder but susan hasn’t counted on a twentyfirst century killer or a killer storm death of the keynote speaker blends a fictional abigail brewster with the actual histories of star appledore and smuttynose islands susan needs to piece together the connections between the past and the present as she searches for a murderer while trapped with her group in a creaky hotel with no locks on the doors praise for death of the keynote speaker if a violent storm outside the old hotel on this rugged historic island aren’t enough to get your pulse pounding the strange thoughts and actions of island denizens and conference goers will many have an axe to grind so to speak but only one applies the blade to a living person fastpaced and filled with new england island lore and literary references “death” would be a good read in any setting carole t beers author saddle tramps in her second susan warner mystery sharon dean challenges the reader to solve an intriguing puzzle involving the biography of fictional nineteenth century author abigail brewster in addition to the murder of one of the scholars attending a conference devoted to abigail brewster studies a retired literature professor dean is at her best here parsing academic riddles romances and rival interpretations of ms brewster’s life and work—especially that part touching on her stay at an island resort off the new hampshire coast called the isles of shoals where a lurid ax murder took the lives of three of abigail’s friends shortly after her last stay there a modern murder that eerily evokes the famous triple homicide of abigail’s day takes place as those same islands site of an academic conference are gripped by a fierce storm and help from the mainland is impossible susan is there to sleuth out the solution to the crime while trying not to get killed herself very entertaining read mj daspit author lucy lied  tour  de trace aargus books  the younger cyclists who signed up for camping and biking along mississippi’s natchez trace may think of susan warner as old but she is no miss marple or jessica fletcher retired from teaching she sports a lavender streak in her silver hair and though she has the slowest mph she can cover the distance but when she steps out of her tent the first morning only ten of her fellow cyclists appear the eleventh has left a note saying that she will return later later never happens instead the riders discover the cyclist’s body stretched crucifixionstyle on an ancient indian mound with each turn of her bicycle wheel susan searches for the killer is it an exhusband the owner of a decrepit bed and breakfast a snake handler or is it one of the cyclists her ride along the natchez

university press of florida  sharon dean has recompiled dated and in many cases physically reassembled all of woolson’s extant correspondence from nearly forty sources dean’s painstaking work presents the fullest picture we have of woolson and functions as an important corrective to the fictional portrayals in these letters one finds rich personal detail alongside ruminations on contemporary political and social conditions a trenchant critic of the customs and mores of her age woolson in her letters offers a nuanced perspective on life as a woman and as a writer in the nineteenth century praise for the complete letters dean     a seasoned scholar of woolson’s life and works brings to this ambitious project her wealth of knowledge about the author    editing a collection of letters is not easy task but dean has done a meticulous job producing a volume that is userfriendly and offers an abundance of social and historic context    this rich volume also features an eloquent introduction and a chronology that documents notable events in woolson’s life a superb resource d d knight suny college at cortland choice january   scholars of constance fenimore woolson owe sharon dean a great debt as do scholars of henry james considering that woolson was one of his closest friends dean has singlehandedly advanced immeasurably the study of this remarkable author whose works are exposed to ever sharper more complex modes of analysis but whose life has remained shadowy at best    dean has performed the difficult feat of making the letters accessible to students and lay readers as well as useful to scholars it is an immense achievement that will spark new readings of woolson’s life and works as well as her relationship with james dean now professor emerita from rivier college has left a lasting legacy that will enrich woolson scholarship for many years to come anne boyd rioux university of new orleans henry james review               meticulously edited and contextualized dean’s edition of woolson’s complete letters opens the door to an extraordinarily gifted writer’s works it offers depth to woolson studies but it also connects woolson to the nineteenthcentury literary marketplace in new and fascinating ways sharon m harris university of connecticut             peopled by the famous the infamous and the unknown the letters sparkle with intelligence and energy providing insight into contemporary attitudes that woolson sometimes shared sometimes satirized and sometimes defied while they reveal an ample sensibility that anticipates today’s concerns for the environment regional and national identity and global citizenship karen kilcup author of robert frost and feminine literary tradition             ultimately these letters reveal the broad scope of a welltraveled life and the depth of an intensely observant artist every reader interested in the lives of nineteenthcentury authors or women should savor every one of this extraordinary writer’s letters anne boyd rioux president constance fenimore woolson society             scholars interested in constance fenimore woolson and nineteenthcentury american women’s writing more broadly owe a debt of gratitude to sharon l dean for her meticulous edition of woolson’s letters    the university press of florida deserves praise for undertaking the publication of dean’s edition     the letters fill a single volume but an unusually long one for a university press melissa j homestead university of nebraskalincoln legacy   editor with victoria brehm constance fenimore woolson selected stories and travel narratives knoxville university of tennessee press  this volume as the first anthology to collect representative samples of woolson’s stories travel sketches poems and correspondence represents a major advance toward reestablishing her place in nineteenthcentury literature and letters as these pieces demonstrate woolson offered keen observations of the issues she card most deeply about namely the cultural and political transformation of the united states in the wake of the civil war the status of women writers and artists in the nineteenth century and the growing implications of nationalism and imperialism    this collection features selections fro each of the three distinct periods of woolson’s career and includes a chronology of her life and travels focusing primarily on woolson’s short stories editors victoria brehm and sharon l dean also include a representative letter poem and travel sketch for each section praise for selected stories and travel narratives             thanks to the movement to revise and expand the american literary canon a number of minority and women writers have been rescued from obscurity in the last three decades woolson is one of the latest whose literature and legacy have been revived as a result of the revolution in the canon in this handsome volume brehm grand valley state univ and dean rivier college both seasoned woolson scholars make available for the first time some of woolson’s finest writing offering selections that range from short stories and travel narratives to poems and correspondence

july  constance fenimore woolson and edith wharton perspectives on landscape and art knoxville university of tennessee press  the first study to draw connections between constance fenimore woolson and edith wharton this book explores the contrasting ways in which these two important writers responded to the rapidly changing landscapes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries sharon l dean considers the travel essays of woolson and wharton as well as their fiction and contextualizes their work with the rise in tourism and with evolving theories and techniques of landscape design she argues that for both writers the manner in which they saw and transcribed landscape informed their ways of seeing themselves as artists from the dust jacket full of fresh insights into the literary achievements of both woolson and wharton dean’s book will also prompt readers to reconsider their own responses and obligations to landscape and how these responses are shaped by their experience and by larger cultural forces constance fenimore woolson homeward bound knoxville university of tennessee press  using a thematic approach sharon l dean examines woolson’s novels and short stories in terms of how they illuminate her era’s attitudes about a variety of cultural issues artistic endeavor the struggle for women’s rights demographic change and the rise of industrialism and the nexus of social class race relations and ethnicity    this study demonstrates how woolson journeyed in her writing from a vision of homogenous regional communities to a vision of the diversity and tension embedded in the national community and finally to a vision of herself as an outsider in relation to all communities praise for constance fenimore woolson homeward bound the strength of constance fenimore woolson homeward bound is sharon dean’s ability to interweave biographical details of woolson’s life with discussions of her fiction this interweaving in conjunction with dean’s engaging prose style makes woolson’s life and works come alive  deborah barker american literature  june               dean offers valuable critical appraisals of woolson’s work especially the treatment of race and of gender expectations in her fiction  melissa m pennell university of massachusetts lowell by contextualizing woolson’s entire corpus within the ethnic regional artistic and
