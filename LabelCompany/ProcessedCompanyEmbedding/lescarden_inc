antimitotic activities studied in clinical trials for over  years biocartilage is also backed by more than  years of laboratory research conducted by the lescarden research team their findings are regarded as the foundation for any cartilage investigation and are universally cited by researchers and manufacturers in discussing product efficacy biocartilage is  pure bovine tracheal cartilage material containing  type two collagen and  mucopolysaccharides including chondroitin sulfates biocartilage is produced to fda good manufacturing practices gmps ensuring product quality and consistency produced for the nutritional supplement market biocartilage is sold on noclaims made basis biocartilage applications inflammatory joint disease through the natural aging process the joints become more restricted and experience a decrease in flexibility in addition the cushioning provided by cartilage and the surrounding synovial fluid degrades leaving the joint more susceptible to stress and disease along with exercise a supplementary regimen including glucosamine and chondroitin has been demonstrated to improve the lubricating environment of the joint and enhance cartilage health biocartilage is a natural source of both of these substances research undertaken by lescarden has shown very positive results in the treatment of inflammatory joint disease in animals as well as arthritis in humans immune system enhancer research indicates that bovine cartilage powder acts as a biological response modifier regulating the activity of important components of the immune system clinical evidence demonstrates that catrix bovine cartilage stimulates b lymphocytes which strengthen the immune system by increasing the level of antibodies circulating in the body as well as stimulating t lymphocytes which identify and fight invasiveforeign cells in the body people suffering from psoriasis have also found that biocartilage in conjunction with a topical application of a catrixbased cream can help to alleviate many of the symptoms of the condition this application has been observed in a clinical trial conducted by lescarden cancer dr prudden’s research investigating

psoriasis cancer is characterized by the over proliferation of cells studies have identified in lescarden’s bovine cartilage a clear protein not collagen that is a potent inhibitor of the growth of renal cell carcinoma laboratory and clinical studies have identified potential pharmacological actions in cartilage which may be beneficial in the treatment of certain types of cancer researchers have discovered that cartilage has demonstrated a stimulating effect on the immune system displays antimitotic activity inhibits the process by which cells divide and multiply and an antiangiogenic effect prevents the growth of new blood vessels cutting off the blood supply tumors need to grow biocartilage is available in bottles of  capsules each containing mg for more information on biocartilage or to order please contact us today  polynag – derived from specially processed crustacean shells polynag is a patented longerlasting form of complex glucosamine for joint health new studies demonstrate that polynag is also effective in the area of animal health polynag® the new generation glucosamine patented longlasting glucosamine for the treatment of osteoarthritis and inflammatory joint disease osteoarthritis the most common form of chronic joint disease affects over  million people in the united states the symptoms range from mild joint discomfort to severe pain and with some total loss of mobility osteoarthritis is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints cartilage is a protein substance that serves as a “cushion” between the bones of the joints the most common treatment is the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen and naproxen unfortunately prolonged use of nsaids could cause significant adverse side effects such as gastro intestinal ulcers and kidney failures moreover while nsaids alleviate pain and swelling they mainly address the symptoms and not the underlying cause of the problem today more and more patients including medical practitioners are using glucosamine in clinical studies glucosamine has been found to be effective in helping to replenish the depleted synovial fluid in the joints which helps improve joint mobility and alleviate pain more importantly glucosamine a naturally occurring amino sugar is virtually devoid of harmful sideeffects the problem with glucosamine is its short half lifeonce ingested it stays in the bloodstream for only  to  minutes in addition a number of clinical trials on glucosamine have been found deficient causing some discomfort from the medical community what is polynag® polynag is a short chain polymer of glucosamine polynacetyldglucosamine derived from specially processed crustacean shells it is patented in north america and europe as a therapy for osteoarthritis in humans and animals the unique molecular structure of polynag produces clinically proven timed release effects providing significant benefits maintains elevated glucosamine in the blood serum over a significantly longer time frame than regular glucosamine allowing the body to optimize the therapeutic benefits of polynag allows for less and possibly evenreduced dosing providing better value and greater convenience for the users studies conducted for polynag involved both humans and animals undertaken by reputable and independent clinical research organizations in the united states and canada randomized double blind studies demonstrated polynag’s ‘staying power’ in the blood stream and it’s efficacy in patients suffering from osteoarthritis for details of the studies please refer to the reference section clinically proven benefits in clinical trials at the university of north texas health science center unthsc orally administered polynag was shown to be fully absorbed by the body and metabolized into glucosamine which was measurably present in subjects’ blood serum the tests confirmed that serum levels of glucosamine remained higher for a longer time over  hours in subjects receiving polynag compared to subjects receiving plain nag in effect polynag offers the arthritis sufferer a form of glucosamine that has “staying power” in the bloodstream a randomized double blinded study conducted at unthsc demonstrated the effectiveness of polynag in treating osteoarthritis the subjects all suffering form oa were studied over a six week period and measured using an osteoarthritis severity index a patient and physician global assessment of pain and mobility as well as an antibody assay for the osteoarthritis ‘biomarker’ the unanimous results indicated that subjects treated with polynag displayed significant improvement on all measurements compared to placebo based on the extraordinary results showing the efficacy and long lasting properties lescarden was awarded a patent for the use of polynag in the treatment of osteoarthritis in the us canada and in europe how does polynag work polynag® is produced from cgmp pharmaceutical grade facilities in north america where its patented uniquely processed ingredients are packaged its molecules are processed in the body by enzymes called ‘gut chitinase’ which was recently discovered in the gastric chief cells parotid gland and von ebner’s gland through its uniquelyprocessed molecules polynag® is gradually released into the blood serum maintaining a high level bioavailability over a significant time frame where it is then eventually distributed in the joints the polynag advantage •longer lasting glucosamine benefits means more convenient once a day dosing •clinically proven effective for both humans and animals •safe and nontoxic for daily use •highest quality standards polynag is manufactured at pharmaceutical production facilities under strict cgmp and each lot is tested to meet lescarden’s stringent specifications for quality or purity for more information on how polynag can assist in joint pain relief contact us today  for more information on catrix or to
