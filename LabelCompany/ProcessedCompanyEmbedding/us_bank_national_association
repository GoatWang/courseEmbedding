reviews of us bank scored  out of worst customer service from manager overall rating interest rate and cost office environment  staff waiting time other servicesby momofdaughters jul  the manager was asked to assist with my large cashier check deposit and an outgoing cashiers check  although she approved it she was very impersonal and stuck up as if i should be grateful she was doing me this favor  she didnt even introduce herself to me and just proceeded to talk to the teller about the transactions and her decision to hold some of the funds in front of me as if i wasnt there  ill never go to that location again ill go to another branch location next time and might even consider switching banks  i felt unwelcome and not at all treated with respect  that manager acted as if she was too good to even greet me she never even smiled   unbelievable   this reviewer has be with this bank for  years this reviewer had    banks before this review was made on us bank eau claire sky park

office environment  staff waiting time other servicesby nellyt jul  recently got married and have not had time to change my name with the bank  have been a customer for over  years enrolled in direct deposit from my job so i rarely have to walk into a branch  received a payroll check this timeand customer service said i just needed my marriage certificate and id when i walked into the branch arielassistant manager was very rude and condescending saying she couldnt verify my identity with just a piece of paper since my dl had already my married name  in no way was she even apologetic with the wrong information i was given  nor did she even try to explain why my original copy of marriage certificatewhich has my old name and new name wasnt enough called customer service again they said i should be able to simply cash the check since the name matched with my new dl   ariel again did not even try to explain why she couldnt i was confused since i was under the impression banks are supposed to do that she went on to say this isnt a check cashing place wow im extremely disappointed with the way i was treated and how insensitive she was with my situation this reviewer has be with
