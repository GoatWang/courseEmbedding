vice president  middle east and north africa frederico justus regional vice president middle east  north africa what attracted you to work in the og business when i graduated in  in brazil og was a promising business environment as petrobras was growing fast also og seemed more adventurous—going offshore rigs and traveling to different places—than a conventional engineering job what do you enjoy most about your job it’s a winwin situation when i help to develop our people and promote prosperity in the various countries where i’ve worked all while creating value for the shareholders and for the clients it’s an unbelievable feeling of accomplishment what attracted you to weatherford and what has caused you to stay weatherford has a very entrepreneurial spirit like that of our main leader our business focus makes working here less bureaucratic than our peers in the industry this means that you can make a difference and add more value at weatherford according to your talents and knowledge the career possibilities top management’s views and the leadership styles are all key to me staying at weatherford what opportunities has weatherford provided you both professionally and personally that you may not have experienced working elsewhere the exposure to different environments and the ability to start and finish a cycle in a certain management job has been great i was in continental europe when we deployed a highlevel strategy that doubled our business between  and  it has been successful because when i left that job in  my very talented successor kept following the strategy and growing the business then i became vice president subsaharan africa and went to a completely different environment that required a different strategy and approach now i am leading the middle east and north africa region how has working with different culturesin different countries influenced you both professionally and personally my path in the oilfield began in  i’ve lived in  countries so far and visited more than  countries i have had great experiences in every single one of them and the exposure to diverse cultures helped me to mature and to understand and respect different mindsets what has your career progression with weatherford been like it’s been great so far i’ve worked in germany central europe continental europe including italy all of the northern mediterranean area eastern europe then caspian uk and norway recently i managed a very promising area with the highest growth rate by far in the worldsubsaharan africa—helping to develop weatherford in huge markets like nigeria and angola my latest assignment has been in the middle east  north africa region where i am now based in dubai what has been the most challenging or interesting project in your career and what did you learn from it the most challenging project is always the current one because every single business environment has a unique optimal recipe for success my challenges in subsaharan africa were far greater than the previous ones in europe because we had to overcome lots of infrastructural problems to be successful we have a great team with a good mix of experience knowledge and willingness to succeed one of the main principals i have learned is to surround myself with good and competent people we have high expectations for the middle east  north africa region and i am excited for the challenges and opportunities ahead what has been the highlight of your career with weatherford so far it’s unfair to rate one project over another but the main highlights have been the people and team development that achieve results i’ve been very fortunate to work with great teams since i’ve joined weatherford and i remember several success stories during the endesa project in spain weatherford successfully integrated  product lines in a single project which provided more value to our customer once complex projects like this are completed the capabilities of the team can be deployed to other environments also weatherford’s complete turnaround in romania and eastern europe was a fantastic achievement recently in the first half of  subsahara managed to be the number one region in the world in profitability—up from number six only a year ago what advice would you give to a recent graduate about opportunities working in the og industry join us but not just for the initial compensation join us to know the world to appreciate diversity to grow as a person and as a professional and the compensation will follow do you have any hobbies or participate in any interesting activities i was a basketball player until i became an adult…then after a long gap…i’ve started to do triathlons it’s very challenging to prepare for triathlons under an intense work
