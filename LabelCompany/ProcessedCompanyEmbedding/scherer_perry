marketing essay ukessays trusted by students since     todays opening times    bst organizational structure of nestle pakistan marketing essay print reference this apa mla mla harvard vancouver wikipedia published rd march  this essay has been submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers now companies are improving their production by adopting different strategies in which backward integration is one of them backward integration is a type of vertical integration in which a company gets control over its suppliers to improve the efficiency and save the cost which improves its profit margins and make the firm more competitive backward integration occurs through acquiring input suppliers establishing longterm contracts with existing suppliers or investing in new input production capacity through internal corporate growth the main advantages of backward integration regardless of the industry are decreased marketing expenses the stability of operations the certainty of supplies of materials much control on the distribution of products tighter quality control the on time review of fabrication and allocation policies more control over inventory and additional profit margins or the ability to charge lower prices on final products these advantages must be weighed against the disadvantages which normally are disparities among productive capacities at a range of stages of manufacturing governmental pressure lack in interest of specialty the firmness of operations the extension of the management team and

 functional description of organizations backward integration nestle pakistan and engro foods are currently doing backward integration to enhance their production efficiency by creating their own dairy farms and taking control of transportation currently they are focusing of creating their own farms to get control over their suppliers both the companies are also now directly approaching to the farmers and collecting milk form them as the old concept of middle man and gawala system has start perishing the main advantage of creating own farms is that both the companies get on time delivery of their material which help them to enhance their production and deliver their product on time to the end consumers the details of engro foods and nestle pakistan farms are given below  engro foods dairy farm engro food has selected the nara canal due to the presence of its outstanding water farming land availability and suitable weather for its dairy farm the company has launched a comprehensive vaccination programme with the provision of clean water and balanced nutrition to have infection free strong and happy animals at all times the companys nara dairy farm continued to remain a rich and nutritious source of raw material for its dairy section the nara farm formed over  mn liters of milk in  with a total herd size of over  animals but in  dairy farm produced  liters of milk per day at march   dairy farm herd increased to  animals through it the profit after tax stood at rs  million versus loss of rs  million in march  primarily due to higher yield and production  nestle dairy farms nestle pakistan manages the project under its agricultural division over  professionals are currently associated with these services intend to help in increasing the sustainability of the dairy segment in pakistan they give the farmers with free technical assistance and veterinary services to build the skills of the farmers in best farming practices and improved livestock management and link them to small businesses and to the dairy market for this purposenestle has built two demonstrations and teaching farms one of which is still under process the main training

dairy farming and livestock management nestle pakistan has established this training facility over  acres of leased land as an investment for the development of the dairy sector and to work towards sustainable farming and an improved rural economy    literature review the concept of vertical integration is very old and we saw a lot of academic and legal debates over the costs and benefits of vertical integration mcgee bassett and williamson    said that vertical integration is a mean of reducing transactions costs assuring supply reducing risk and alleviating the efficiency losses but on the other side economists see vertical integration as a means for firms to reduce competition or extract market rents scherer perry  perry hart and tirole  said that most discussions have focused on the effects of forward integration into a competitive product market and little work exists on the effects of backward integration into a competitive input market however knoeber and thurman  further said that backward integration is of growing importance in many agricultural and natural resource industries according to azzam  backward integration occurs through acquiring input suppliers establishing longterm contracts with existing suppliers or investing in new input production capacity through internal company growth in some businesses there is growing concern about the effects of such integration on remaining un integrated input suppliers first he said that backwardintegrated dominant firm benefits from production efficiency gains second he further adds that backwardintegrated dominant firm may benefit from a lower acquisition price for externally supplied raw inputs as per blois  the biggest advantages of backward integration are to lower down transportation and marketing expense production or operation stability timely supplier services high quality control necessary revisions in production and execution policies maintained inventory control and high profit margin able produces to charge lower prices on finished products while williamson  do not consider supply dependability as a necessary advantage and point out the interests harmonization and efficient utilization in process of decision making as the core advantages of backward integration as per williamson  backward integration allows management to easily harmonized interest as possible differences can be resigned as per lambertini and rossini  backward vertical integration is indirectly proportional to producers and suppliers as compare to forward vertical integration backward vertical integration provides large incentives in investment to the manufacturer the biggest disadvantage of backward integration for trader is that it discourages them for innovation on the other hand forward integration discourages producers to innovate this theory is not parallel to transaction cost theory which does not consider forward and backward integration as a separate concept many researchers like armour teece langlois robertson gopala krishnan bierly     and  have stated that vertical integration facilitates the development and implementation of systemic innovations further armour and teece  argue that if the innovation at one stage involves adaptation in a preceding or a consequent stage then the usual ownership of the various stages ie vertical integration enables the necessary adaptations and adjustments to be made in a timely and efficient fashion similarly langlois robertson  and langlois  propose that vertical integration is the most appropriate organizational structure for integrative systemic process innovations because the necessary learning and experience proceed faster between functions in a vertically integrated environment furthermore teece  explains that vertical integration enables the successful development and implementation of systemic innovations by facilitating information flows and coordination and removing institutional barriers such as cost and benefit allocation similarly gopal krishnan and bierly  point out that open exchange of information is easier and safer in house than between different organizations because each firm wants to gain more from the innovation and therefore unwilling to share information freely teece  however adds that while systemic innovations favour vertically integrated structures from the coordination point of view and some relevant technological or other capabilities needed in the development and implementation of the innovation may exist outside of the vertically integrated firm therefore larger firms may still have an advantage by using their scale to create sufficient momentum and attract smaller firms to get involved with the innovation or simply by being able to secure minority investment positions in smaller firms that have the necessary capabilities needed in the innovation  anaysis swot analysis strengths of engro foods strengths of nestle pakistan brand association engro being a renowned and well established brand in fertilizers infrastructure and it solutions it creates a great brand association and consumers can relate to olpers as a high quality and premium product this is evidence that engro food in its first year crossed  billion sales figure financial backing engro being renowned brand and can attract foreign investors which enable them to compete with global brands like nestle they can afford high costs for research and developments for their current products and in introducing new products strategic relationship engro has been creating business relationship with farmers who supply milk to them which enables them to secure the supply and to solve shortage issues engro also has created longterm business relationship with distributors this help them to ensure smooth distribution through better channels to make sure that there are no shortages for their product research and development engro for olpers precisely has done strong consumer and product research before launching the product and are continuing this practice post launch this has helped them to emerge as a strong brand in food industry to further development and new products they have engaged various global research partners mindshare ac nielsen jwt asiatic and mars marketing and advertising agency state of the art plants only engro foods has the rd generation uht milk plant in the country it is the only plant that uses bactofuge technology to virtually eliminate bacteria and ensure premium quality and hygiene parent company nestle has a global presence and is recognized as a huge name worldwide nestle pakistan has a strong support from its parent company which is the worlds leading processed food and beverage company company image nestle has been doing business since many years it has created an excellent image and reputation in consumers mind all around the world this helps them to retain market even in unfavorable conditions high quality products nestle always ensure to produce good quality products nestle being worldwide renowned company creates high quality product to retain that image and to attain consumer loyalty it cannot compromise on quality as consumers nowadays are more quality conscious market share nestle has the highest market share almost in every sbus line like as in milk pack  nestle pure life brand strength nestle pakistan has created some very strong brands like nescafe milpak  everyday nestle water and most of these brands have become generic to their product category when a brand becomes generic it creates a strong presence in minds of consumer research  development team research and development is a continuous process at nestle it gives updated info on consumer behaviors changing trends and consumer demands this helps nestle to adapt to changing trends weakness of engro foods weakness of nestle pakistan packaging engro food is dependent on tetra pak for packaging of its entire dairy products it is the only option for them as tetra pack has monopoly in packaging sector this cause higher production costs distribution cost about  milk collection centers of engro foods are located in punjab and its processing facility is in sind this huge distance increase distribution cost and increasing overall cost of production also it increases the chances of milk getting spoiled due to long travelling time narrow product line since the launch of its first dairy product engro foods has only extended to very few products where as its competitors like nestle has diversified and extensive product lines owning red color engro food like its competitors has not owned colors that identify its products colors represent products like green represents milkpak there is no color connection attached to olpers which creates problems for consumers in remembering the product less proactive nestle being a huge company is very less proactive to the demands unless competitors initiate a campaign or come up with new strategy nestle does not bring changes limited distribution channel a major weakness of nestle is their limited distribution channel as compared to their competitors nestle distribute their products to whole sellers in their own factory vehicles stock outs due to their inefficient distribution channels nestle has experienced stock outs on regular basis this had adverse effect on companys image and consumer base it also gives opportunity for competitor to penetrate into market and capture large market share  premium brand common men generally perceive nestle as a premium brand and have perception that all nestle products would be highly expensive opportunities for engro food opportunities for nestle pakistan government funding government has provided increased funds to farmers this has allowed farmers to invest in better storage facilities to save milk for longer period of time and to cope bad weather conditions awareness extensive awareness programs for health and hygiene has created awareness among consumers for the benefits of processed milk more and more consumers are shifting from loose milk to processed milk this will create higher demands and consumption of processed milk this is a great opportunity for growth and to gain more market fifth largest producer of milk pakistan is the th largest milk production country in the world the country is blessed four seasons and high quality crop good species of buffaloes and cows and largest canal system however it is only obtaining ltr of milk per annum from an animal in comparison with ltr per animal in developed countries this is a good opportunity to increase production significantly by adopting best practices and modern techniques support from foreign investors government is supporting overseas outlay in pakistan which is a great opportunity for nestle to expand its business in pakistan and to cater large markets enhance distribution channel nestle should work on its distribution channel to make it efficient in order to maintain supply of their products this will not allow consumer to shift to competitors brand in case of stock outs changing social trend consumers especially younger generation are hugely influenced by western societies this has changed the trends for packed ready to use products this changing social trend has created large demand and opportunity to increase market share best practices and assistance nestle should invest in educating the farmers for best practices and providing them resources and assistance to create greater value and to ensure high capitalization and quality threats for engro food threats for nestle pakistan competition engro foods biggest competitors like nestle has been in market since very long for its brands it might be difficult to penetrate in the market where these brands have created loyalties and presence in mind of consumers perceptions and price differentials consumer preferences and perceptions plays very important role in success of a brand it is very important for engro to understand and come up with ways to meet consumer expectations and provide quality that a brand promises price factor is also a very important factor as still consumers prefer loose milk as it is cheaper than processed milk economy higher inflation rates is eroding buying power of consumers making products more expensive to use no entry barrier industry is growing at rapid rate very low entry barriers making it attractive for new competitors dependency nestle is dependent on whole sellers and super market shelves which can be influenced by the competitors loss of market share when the market drenches the loss of the market share of nestle products is the major threat to them differentiated products consumers are indifferent to buying engro products or nestle it is a threat to nestle that consumers can easily shift to engro products in case of any unfavorable condition  pest analysis pest analysis is used to determine and understand external factors such as political economical social and technological and their effect on business for understanding nestle and engro foods position in market we will carry out pest analysis to understand the external forces  political legal  economic factors pakistan current fiscal year inflation rate has been grown to  which decreases the purchasing power of consumers as a whole and which also create higher impact on those products which transform from another products like packed milk  powder milk because these is already sell on high prices in market because of high quality so this whole scenario directly create impact on those organization whole deals or manufacture these products like engro  nestle they have two option in this situation either to sustain prices or to decrease prices on the other hand government regulation related to taxes become more contracting day by day and government is not given any compensation in current budget policy engro and nestle also facing competition new domestic player are entering in the dairy and food sector so they have to increase their investments in order to remain the market leaders for example nirala good milk and pakola are the few names which have recently introduced their dairy product lines in the market major textile groups are also entering into dairy and livestock business and some of them have even acquired lands to start their business in march this year nestle pakistan opened a state of the art milk processing facility in kabirwala punjab this plant of nestle pakistan is the largest milk reception facility in the world which has a processing capacity of  million liters of milk per day  socio cultural factors in order to make a noticeable increase in saturation many challenges and perceptions still have to be overcome by the engro and nestle the least important one perhaps is tradition as still urbanized consumers have the perception that the arrival of the doodhwala at their home on his trusty bicycle has the fresh and natural milk which is coming straight away from the cow and still it is this perception that only loose milk is fresh over the years all companies of this sector especially the two older players nestle and haleeb while on the other hand in order to convert loose milk consumer in to processed milk consumer engro foods limited have been making dynamic efforts by various development program in interior sindh regardless these campaigns will not change perception of loose milk consumer overnight but it is not impossible it take time and continuous investment create awareness of the processed milk to the consumer of loose milk every products whole period consists of a starting phase expansion phase and maturity phase another hurdle which is facing by engro foods and nestle is the price to convert loose milk users to processed liquid milk the situation is worst in punjab as most of the dairy farms are located there and the the price of loose milk very cheap as compare to the price of olpers and milpak in sindh however the price differential between loose and processed milk is very narrow as a result of price considerations engro foods and nestle have not increasing their prices rapidly moreover nestle and engro have introduced smaller packages to cater to consumers with limited cash flows although there is a convenience factor at play here as well  technological factors in year  the ministry of industries and production established dairy pakistan company on the lines and model of australian dairy the main objectives of the company are as under to advance milk and other dairy products in the domestic as well as international markets to promote advancement of dairy supply chain in pakistan by supporting and make it easy for the farmers to support dairy division development by way of supporting and facilitating business development services for the enterprises across the dairy value chain to promote skill improvement transfer assimilation streamlining acquiring andor upgradation across dairy value chain by undertaking new initiatives to help introduce global best executive practices for better productivity and operational efficiencies to promote education and skills advancement of human resources associated with the dairy sector this dairy pakistan company plays a vital role in the dairy industry and the two major player of this industry the engro foods and nestle pakistan are now heavily focusing on the technological factor engro foods has developed the rd generation uht milk plant in the country it is the only plant that uses bactofuge technology to virtually eliminate bacteria and ensure premium quality and hygiene whereas nestle has built two training farms to educate and train the local farmers the main training facility is the sarsabz demonstration and training farm which is located on multan road near okara the second training sukeki farm is under construction near lahore  secret of their success engro foods limited  nestle pakistan as we all know in processed milk industry engro foods limited is now at the top of it in term of quality and market share the main reason of its success is their supply chain strategy and before making supply chain strategy they make nestle as a benchmark before establishing this unit initially their top management realized that if milk and ice cream is going to be our core products then supplier will be the most important area to be maintain because they analyzed that minor lacking in supply chain management system will cause them in facing imbalance demand and supply low quality issues raise in infrastructure and less knowledge among farmers so in this way they started to make partnership with suppliers and support its strategy of establishing long term relationship with its suppliers by helping them in difficult times in order to lower than their transportation cost they made strategic moves by establishing two production plants in sahiwal and sukkur which are near to farmers and cattlemens in this way engro foods lower their transportation cost and other issues like less time to reach production area so they easily manage cooling temperature for the production of ice cream and not only educated local people of interior regarding farming but also built new farms cooperated with undp and pakistan dairy development the second most important step which engro foods took to make their strategy more effective and efficient is that they started livestock development program to build awareness among local public of interior sindh to how to cattle their sheep goats and cows better this whole program was stated with undp collaboration through this program interior locals increase milk yield and also use livestock potential the best part of their supply chain strategy is that their strategy starts from customer need rather than raw materials procurement this approach lead them to success storage processing transportation to plant packaging customer need raw material acquisition warehousing distribution retailer whole seller final consumer the main success of engro foods is there supply chain and their approaches toward supply chain are different which is not followed by any other competitors of this industry and the other factor of efl success is their advertising which creates big impact on the consumers especially in ramadan they launch very attractive and very appealing advertise through electronic media similarly nestle pakistan is one of the top leading companies in dairy products the secret of their success is almost same like engro foods they built their production plant in those villages from where farms are near like in kabirwala and sheikhupura the main difference between engro foods and nestle is that the nestle is the first mover in processed milk who come with the idea for those women who are professionals and who are unable to feed their infant children so with this idea they made a formula of processed milk in late nineties and after getting bigger success in europe they thought to move to asia and in pakistan they are running their operation with same strategy as engro foods is following like establishing new farms but they did it before because nestle was the first company in pakistan who come up with the idea of making new farms in order to improve quality and transportation cost but they didnt take a part in development of cattlemans regarding milk collection like engro foods did it  conclusion nestle is one of the leading and the most renowned multinational company of food and beverages sector which is enjoying a leading position in the food and beverage industry of pakistan however nestle pakistan should focus more on its marketing via other medias such television commercials and news papers ads like other competitors to achieve higher market share in its growing industry locally and transfer its lower cost benefit to its consumers in order to create long term loyal consumers engro foods limited current standings and market share is totally in favour of them because of their supply chain management strategy approach and it can be expect that in long term their position will sustain their position because of their good will which is being created secondly the company is backed by a very strong group in term of reputation and financial position in market  recommendation  nestle should invest more in the marketing activities for nestle milkpak  nestle should need to create strong brand loyalty among its consumers for milkpak as now there are many competitors in the market that are trying to outperform each other  while designing any strategy for the products the company should keep in the intricate competitive environment  the company should try to create the lasting impression of its milk products on its customers through easily recallable jingle bells like haleeb used sabs se gharra doodh haleeb chai bnaye khoob haleeb  for nesvita the company should concentrate on both genders and of all ages instead of just concentrating on just young women as far as engro foods limited is concern they should sustain their current position in order to launch differentiated products timely in future like nestle introduced maggi something like that they should introduce because in this sector efl has a gap and dairy technology program should be starting in order to make production more efficient and effective like they previously started
