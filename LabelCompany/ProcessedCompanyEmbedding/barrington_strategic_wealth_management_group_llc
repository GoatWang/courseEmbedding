asset allocation must be dynamic asset allocation we believe that asset allocation is more important to overall performance and volatility reduction than almost any other decision each investor’s allocation is different depending on his or her combination of goals time horizon and risk tolerance your own allocation might utilize some combination of equity fixed income alternative strategies cash equivalents and real estaterelated investments diversification diversification means achieving a blend of individual investments within asset classes to accomplish a specific riskreward goal to be effective diversification should dynamically reflect the future probabilities not look backward at the past these asset allocation wheels are examples of allocations that may be appropriate for some investors at a point in time an investor’s particular goals circumstances and risk tolerance will dictate the appropriate allocation for that investor the allocation wheels are presented here only to reflect how diversification may look under a given set of circumstances all investments have some risk some of these strategies have more risk than traditional investments diversified
