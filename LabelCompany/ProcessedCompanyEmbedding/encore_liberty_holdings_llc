programming despite industry shift new york cnnfn  even as premium cable channel showtime increases its dependence on original programming competing network encorestarz doesnt feel the pressure to follow suit      since october  viacom incs showtime has turned to original programming in hopes of winning over television audiences and market share     the shift underscores the dominant role industry leader hbo has played in the premium cable segment hbo a unit of time warner inc has been utilizing original programming since      but encorestarz whose parent company telecommunications inc tci lacks production ties with any major studio isnt concerned about the void     they showtime havent gone to original production by choice theyve gone because they dont have studio output explained robert bennett president and chief executive at liberty media tcis programming subsidiary     indeed bennett highlighted one of the concerns that has led many on wall street to speculate about the future of showtime in viacoms portfolio of assets      its my view that viacom is somehow trying to spin it off or sell it with the competition from encorestarz and the dominance of hbo there just isnt that much room for it said arthur rockwell analyst at drake securities     despite this years strong positioning of showtime the viacom network faces a sharp reduction in its theatrical products as a result of shifting supply agreements in the near future          by  showtime will gain the exclusive distribution rights of new releases from paramount studios but the network loses the broadcast rights for sonys tristar and time warners castle rock to hbo in the year      that leaves showtime with polygram pending the status of its merger into universal pictures and mgmua a major studio known for its highquality lowquantity release schedule     meanwhile encorestarz will retain seagram cos universal pictures time warners new line and the theatrical releases of buena vistamiramax units of walt disney co     we dont feel a need to create a lot of new product bennett said during a telephone interview with cnnfn     and with the lions share of hollywood product going toward hbo industry observers have renewed speculation about a possible alliance between the perennial no  and no  premium cable channels     somewhere down the road a closer alliance between starz and showtime may make sense said philip olsen analyst at ubs securities     but attempts in the early part of this decade for showtime and encorestarz to join forces were stopped by federal regulators and liberty medias bennett refuted any notion that the two companies were currently interested in such a partnership     bennett however did confirm negotiations over a possible alliance with cablevision systems corp in an effort to strengthen its subscriber base which totaled  million customers as of march      in february cablevision became  percent owned by liberty medias parent tci that led many to speculate about partnerships between encorestarz and american movie classicsbravo two cablevision properties     were partners with them at various levels we have held talks all the time but i dont want to comment bennett said     in order to maintain its position in the face of competition from digital broadcast satellite dbs encorestarz has relied on multiple channel broadcasting based on various themes such as action or romance     and this strategy known as thematic multiplexing has been duplicated by showtime as well as hbo     if youre not thinking that way and stuck in an old business model it could be bad for you bennett said     showtime      in the meantime showtime which boasts  million subscribers plans to further concentrate on original programming in its battle against hbo     last weekends thanks of a grateful nation  a madefortelevision film focusing on the debate over gulf war syndrome  was watched by an estimated  american households     in the near term showtime benefits from one of the industrys busiest release schedules the network which normally runs about  theatrical releases annually will have more than  hollywood films in      in fact showtime suppliers will release more pictures than either hbo or starz said matthew duda executive vice president of program acquisitions at showtime     shares of showtimes parent company viacom via were down  at  in wednesday trading on the american stock exchange     liberty medias stock lbtya was up  at  on the nasdaq time warner shares twx lost  to  on the new york
