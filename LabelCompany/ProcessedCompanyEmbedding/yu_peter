postmates gmat pill cofounderapr  why gmat pill is a great productthis post is an application of the framework i introduced in a prior post a universal framework for understanding great productsas part of my exercise evaluating the products at the companies i’ve worked at here is a product perspective for gmat pill a company i cofounded in gmat pill is an online gmat test prep course helping students score higher on the gmat exam it entered the market in  with these unique angleseffective simulation of the private tutoring experience by leveraging video screen recording and audio recording technologyconvenient online and mobile access  via website and mobile appsaffordable price point  and in pillsized pieces of  eachtrusted gmat expert as private teacher plus email testimonials  rating on public forums etceasytofollow framework approach month study plan with notifications and morei’ll go into how gmat pill works from a product perspective metrics etc in another post but for now i tell you why it’s a great product from a framework approach it’s useful convenient affordable trustworthy and easytousea useful effectively transfers ‘thinking process’in the gmat test prep market test takers wanted practice questions practice tests and text explanations ultimately these test takers wanted higher scoresgmat pill delivered on these points and went farther than its competitors by offering video explanations — specifically videos simulating a private tutoring experience which makes the transfer of knowledge or thinking process between teacher and student that much more effective than traditional textbook studying or group classroom learning the unique approach was useful and effectiveb convenienttraditionally students’ options were limited gmat prep books were bulky to carry around and inperson classrooms were highly inconvenient for students mostly busy working professionals to attend in evenings or on saturday morningsgmat pill was convenient because it offered its prep services via its online website — accessible anywhere with an internet connectionc trustworthysigning up for gmat prep services is an incredibly important decision for mba aspiring students taking the gmat exam is typically usually only a once or mb twice in a lifetime event so getting services from a credible  reliable  trustworthy  consistent source is a really important aspect to a gmat prep servicegmat pill takes this dimension to the extremescreenshots of real email testimonials real video testimonials with students in them audio interviews with students links to social media accounts snapshots of real official score reports reviews on rd party websites — all attest to the credibility of results that students got and the effectiveness of the coursebackground information on the instructor zeke lee a stanford graduate who scored in the top –ile of students is available all online free video previews and articles written by zeke lee solidify his credibility as a gmat expert and build trust as the audio of his voice in the video previews help students evaluate the teacher and the effectiveness of the learning style they might embark on if they sign uplastly in a combination of being “trustworthy  convenient” gmat pill offered direct email support with expert zeke lee himself  convenient for whenever gmat questions may pop up in students’ minds the same level of support also offered in a comments section below every video in the course and every question on its practice question platformd easytousetraditional prep options required a lot of discipline and planning in how to prepare in the – months leading up to test daygmat pill helped facilite by offering month and month study plans rather than get inundated with a large collection of videos we helped students navigate by organizing the course in a thoughtful way and by recommending – month study plans further when subscribed students would get an email at am every day for  days telling students what exactly they should be doing that day by taking a big goal and breaking it down into bitesized chunks gmat pill students would be able to more easily follow the study plane affordabletraditional books were under  and inperson classrooms exceeded  then private tutoring easily went over  was it possible to provide excellent prep at an affordable priceleveraging technology gmat pill was able to do so at a price range between  a price point closer to the middle further gmat pill itself was broken down into  pills if the full course was too expensive students would be able to buy just  of the pills at a price just under  these prices were new to the market and were gladly welcomed by gmat test takersso the above  dimensions useful convenient trustworthy easytouse and affordable are what make gmat pill stand out as a productgmat pill — the rise of mobilenow what happened when the industry landscape changed and mobile apps became popular well the decision to build mobile apps vs a mobileoptimized website is not an easy one future post but gmat pill leveraged mobile apps to improve the gmat pill product in the following dimensionsa convenientmobile devices offered an opportunity for prep services to be even more convenient customers loved to watch prep videos on their couch with an ipad device yes it may have been dangerously comfortable for some students who may have taken advantage of the couch to fall asleep but it was definitely the preferred mode of consumption gmat pill was the very first in the market to offer an ipad appwhen iphone and android devices began getting bigger screens gmat pill made the convenience factor even more accessible by launching iphone and android appsb usefulthe mobile apps gave gmat pill customers one superpower that the desktop website did not provide — the ability to download videos for offline viewing this was incredibly useful as more and more students were accessing the course on mobile while onthego in the subway on the train on the oil rig yes we had students in the oil  gas industry and in other places that had no wifi or internet connection the gmat pill mobile apps made all of these customers very happyclearly gmat pill is fantastic product that really helps solve customer pain points along the dimensions of being useful convenient trustworthy easytouse and affordable i highly

interestsmy research interest has been in experimental studies of the physics of semiconductors i am particularly interested in problems relevant to device application of semiconductors such as defects electronphonon interactions and effects on these as a result of quantum confinement current projectselectronic and vibrational properties of semiconductor nanocrystals study of quantum wells where confinement in a twodimensional plane occurs have demonstrated the importance of confinement in influencing the electronic and vibrational properties of semiconductors it has been predicted that confinement in all three directions quantum dots will have further advantageous effects on device performance my group has started a program to apply laser spectroscopies to systematically investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of semiconductor quantum dots grown by various techniques including ionimplantation into sio and selforganization during epitaxial growth by mbe properties of large bandgap group iiinitride semiconductors recently the japanese company nichia has achieved several notable milestones in the area of semiconductor lightemitting diodes led and lasers using the large band gap semiconductors gan gain and agan this company has produced commercially blue and green led and announced the production of continuouswave room temperature blue laser diodes with lifetimes longer than  hours these breakthroughs have been achieved in thin film of gainn with defect density of above  cm previous semiconductor films in lasers and led typically have at least two orders of magnitude less defects the success of nichia has raised interesting questions such as why the group iiinitrides are so tolerant of defects and whether it is possible to achieve similar effects in other semiconductors in my group we are investigating the origin of the emission from group iiinitrides and the effect of defects on these emission processes high pressure physics pressure is a thermodynamical variable which determines the properties of all matters in the same way as temperature pressure can induce major changes in the structural electronic and magnetic properties of all condensed phases using diamond anvil based high pressure cells we can now measure optical and electrical properties of samples at pressure as high as a million times the atmospheric pressure this
