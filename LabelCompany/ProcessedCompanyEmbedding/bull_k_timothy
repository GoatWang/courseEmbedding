environmental  other inventions  leadership  namrip  hefua  outreach  awards and honours  medals  awards  fellowships  references educationedit leighton was educated at heversham grammar school cumbria and magdalene college cambridge where he was awarded a double first class bachelor of arts degree in natural sciences with honours in physics and theoretical physics in  he stayed on to work in the cavendish laboratory and was awarded a phd in  for image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography career and researchedit following his phd leighton was awarded senior and advanced research fellowships at magdalene college cambridge and the epsrc leighton joined the institute of sound and vibration research isvr at the university of southampton in  as a lecturer in underwater acoustics and completed the monograph the acoustic bubble in the same year he was awarded a personal chair at the age of  and has authored over  publications he has founded and leads a research group and two research organizations namrip and hefua see below he conducts extensive outreach activities particularly for schoolchildren features on radio and video and serves on numerous national and international committees an example lecture can be found at on the web the breadth of his research covers medical humanitarian and environmental sciences beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications his research interests cover acoustical oceanography antimicrobial resistancecitation needed biomedical ultrasound carbon capture and storagecitation needed climate changecitation needed decontaminationcitation needed hospital acquired infectionscitation needed marine zoologycitation needed ultrasound and underwater acoustics the citation of the  paterson medal of the institute of physics states that “ timothy leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth his is an acknowledged world leader in four fields he has delivered over  pioneering advances from devices now used in hospitals to the worlds first count of bubbles in the surf zone crucial to our understanding of atmosphereocean gas flux coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar behind these advances lies rigorous physics ” he strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications as his time as associate dean demonstrated but he also champions generating impact from researchcitation needed leighton strongly believescitation needed that if a technology is to help many people it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers and be sufficiently easy to use no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science that cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit rd funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup rd investmentcitation needed therefore whilst he places high value on quality journal publications these must form part of a publication strategycitation needed with the exception of namrip see below leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changerscitation needed because he believescitation needed that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is in much of research a route to only incremental advances “ we need to work with rigour imagination and wonder unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names or the history of projects in which we have previously worked or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem then when we eventually do find a solution we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us ” leightons research has been funded by the royal society the united states department of energycitation needed the science and technology facilities council the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and the natural environment research council nerc he has also selffunded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor  he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventionscitation needed academic serviceedit leighton is serving or has served on advisory

needed inventionsedit medical and healthcareedit from fundamental science publications leighton has invented systems for detecting bone disease including osteoporosis he invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy an invention that won the  ‘medical  healthcare’ award from ‘the engineer’ key collaborator guys and st thomas nhs foundation trust his scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needlefree injectors for migraine sufferers over  million sold he assisted the institute of cancer research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring  he was a coauthor of the world federation for ultrasound in medicine and biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning since which time  billion mothers and children have been scannedcitation needed he identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them he advises the health protection agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the international commission on nonionizing radiation protectioncitation needed starstream device in  leighton is currentlywhen developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning cleaning without heat or additives saving water energy and cost and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking watercitation needed when cleaning cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target transplant organs microchips etc which could not withstand heat or chemicals most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currentlywhen confidential as a result of patenting restrictions but starstream is securely patented in many countries it cleans down a stream of water and in tests cleans whilst saving up to  water and electricity costscitation needed with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water one use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning as new scientist quoted leighton “  were supposed to wash our hands for at least  seconds in hot soapy water – but in the uk the average is  seconds in cold water it’s not enough and despite all the advertising you can’t change people’s behaviour our answer is to change the water ” starstream won the institution of chemical engineers award for water management and supply the royal society brian mercer award for innovation and the slab product of the year  multidisciplinary teams have shown that starstream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant removing bacterial biofilms cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of creutzfeldt–jakob disease prion it has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls although safe for hands starstream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath which is too hazardous for immersion of hands in a sidebyside comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track a problem which costs the uk rail network £ million each year the managing director of ultrawave ltd john melvile described starstream as “  the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades saving time and potentially lives ” leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using starsaver he says “ i want to build a notforprofit inexpensive battery powered starstream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world making that water dualuse you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide ” humanitarianedit leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives hidden bugging devices and for the location of buried catastrophe victims in avalanches mudslides collapsed buildings etc he invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water key for example to protecting services cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones key collaborator paul white he has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed including one now sold by kongsberg for archaeological and civil engineering purposes with his research associate dr craig dolder he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and low and middleincome countries environmentaledit leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks from pipelines and from methane seeps by their acoustic emissions he invented systems to assess leakage from carbon capture and storage facilities and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed this is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and eventually the atmosphere in the seabed there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel yet as a greenhouse gas methane is  times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide so assessing how much is in the seabed and how much leaks into the atmosphere is a key task he made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean this is important for climate change modelling because over  million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean he worked as part of the team investigating whether manmade sounds can adversely affect benthic species marine life that inhabits the seabed such species have been overlooked in studies on how manmade sounds affect whales dolphins and fish benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species furthermore benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment turning it over and preventing it stagnating and are key to the health of coastal marine environments key collaborator paul white other inventionsedit by predicting the soundscapes of other worlds  and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds he identified key uses of sound by whales  and dolphins he invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source  billion at the oak ridge national laboratory in the us leadershipedit in addition to founding and leading his research group after standing down as associate dean for research for his faculty in  where he achieved his stated aim of making his faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national ref research census leighton founded two organizations which he leads namripedit the network for antimicrobial resistance and infection prevention namrip is a strategic research group with the sole aim of combatting antimicrobial resistance amr and promoting infection prevention as leighton said at namrips  conference “ unless preventative measures are found and noone in the world currently knows what those will be amr will through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’ by  be killing more people than cancer and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy we will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics common medical procedures minor surgery childbirth will become significantly more hazardous and advances in treatments such as those for childhood leukaemia will become reversed ” he set up namrip to search for the required solution with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oftcited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics as quoted by new scientist he explained “ i looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billiondollar fund for new antibiotics it would not sort out the problem it might just buy us an extra decade we need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in ” “ in many parts of the world climate change and flooding war corruption politics received wisdom traditions and religious practices and the supply of fuel and money play a far greater role in food water waste treatment healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another than do the outputs of the drug companies the twin potential catastrophes are global and so are the causes the solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce they lie with farmers plumbers office workers water and sewage workers medical practitioners food retailers innovators in business … indeed most of us and they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies ” in its first year namrip has grown to  members engineers chemists microbiologists environmental scientists veterinary and human medics clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions experts in food ethics and law crucially networked with economists geographers health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to amr and infection prevention offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams with almost weekly publications and successes namrip has delivered in terms of conducting research engaging with industry to roll out solutions to society and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach education and dialogue in  leighton began a plan to roll out namrip’s mission worldwide particularly to lowmiddle income countries with notforprofit interventions through the formation of globalnamrip hefuaedit health effects of ultrasound in air hefua has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing and that current guidelines are inadequate outreachedit leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage and possibly follow careers in science and engineering with school visits science fairs and appearances on tv and radio awards and honoursedit leighton has been awarded the following medals and distinctions medalsedit the  rayleigh medal of the institute of acoustics the  helmholtzrayleigh interdisciplinary silver medal of the acoustical society of america the  r w b stephens medal of the institute of acoustics the  paterson medal of the institute of physics the

healthcare’ award from ‘the engineer’ the inaugural  international medwin prize for acoustical oceanography from the acoustical society of america fellowshipsedit leighton was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in  his nomination reads “ timothy leighton is distinguished for his research on the acoustical physics of bubbles especially their nonlinear behaviour for his inventions and discoveries including bubble measurements in the surf zone pipelines and methane seeps for shock wave lithotripsy monitoring disease detection in cancellous bone and needle free injection for sonar systems that overcome bubble masking and numerous industrial applications his seminal monograph the acoustic bubble has become the primary reference on bubble physical acoustics ” leighton was also

 education  career and research  academic service  inventions  medical and healthcare  humanitarian  environmental  other inventions  leadership  namrip  hefua  outreach  awards and honours  medals  awards  fellowships  references educationedit leighton was educated at heversham grammar school cumbria and magdalene college cambridge where he was awarded a double first class bachelor of arts degree in natural sciences with honours in physics and theoretical physics in  he stayed on to work in the cavendish laboratory and was awarded a phd in  for image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography career and researchedit following his phd leighton was awarded senior and advanced research fellowships at magdalene college cambridge and the epsrc leighton joined the institute of sound and vibration research isvr at the university of southampton in  as a lecturer in underwater acoustics and completed the monograph the acoustic bubble in the same year he was awarded a personal chair at the age of  and has authored over  publications he has founded and leads a research group and two research organizations namrip and hefua see below he conducts extensive outreach activities particularly for schoolchildren features on radio and video and serves on numerous national and international committees an example lecture can be found at on the web the breadth of his research covers medical humanitarian and environmental sciences beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications his research interests cover acoustical oceanography antimicrobial resistancecitation needed biomedical ultrasound carbon capture and storagecitation needed climate changecitation needed decontaminationcitation needed hospital acquired infectionscitation needed marine zoologycitation needed ultrasound and underwater acoustics the citation of the  paterson medal of the institute of physics states that “ timothy leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth his is an acknowledged world leader in four fields he has delivered over  pioneering advances from devices now used in hospitals to the worlds first count of bubbles in the surf zone crucial to our understanding of atmosphereocean gas flux coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar behind these advances lies rigorous physics ” he strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications as his time as associate dean demonstrated but he also champions generating impact from researchcitation needed leighton strongly believescitation needed that if a technology is to help many people it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers and be sufficiently easy to use no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science that cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit rd funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup rd investmentcitation needed therefore whilst he places high value on quality journal publications these must form part of a publication strategycitation needed with the exception of namrip see below leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changerscitation needed because he believescitation needed that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is in much of research a route to only incremental advances “ we need to work with rigour imagination and wonder unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names or the history of projects in which we have previously worked or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem then when we eventually do find a solution we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us ” leightons research has been funded by the royal society the united states department of energycitation needed the science and technology facilities council the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and the natural environment research council nerc he has also selffunded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor  he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventionscitation

for detecting bone disease including osteoporosis he invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy an invention that won the  ‘medical  healthcare’ award from ‘the engineer’ key collaborator guys and st thomas nhs foundation trust his scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needlefree injectors for migraine sufferers over  million sold he assisted the institute of cancer research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring  he was a coauthor of the world federation for ultrasound in medicine and biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning since which time  billion mothers and children have been scannedcitation needed he identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them he advises the health protection agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the international commission on nonionizing radiation protectioncitation needed starstream device in  leighton is currentlywhen developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning cleaning without heat or additives saving water energy and cost and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking watercitation needed when cleaning cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target transplant organs microchips etc which could not withstand heat or chemicals most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currentlywhen confidential as a result of patenting restrictions but starstream is securely patented in many countries it cleans down a stream of water and in tests cleans whilst saving up to  water and electricity costscitation needed with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water one use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning as new scientist quoted leighton “  were supposed to wash our hands for at least  seconds in hot soapy water – but in the uk the average is  seconds in cold water it’s not enough and despite all the advertising you can’t change people’s behaviour our answer is to change the water ” starstream won the institution of chemical engineers award for water management and supply the royal society brian mercer award for innovation and the slab product of the year  multidisciplinary teams have shown that starstream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant removing bacterial biofilms cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of creutzfeldt–jakob disease prion it has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls although safe for hands starstream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath which is too hazardous for immersion of hands in a sidebyside comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track a problem which costs the uk rail network £ million each year the managing director of ultrawave ltd john melvile described starstream as “  the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades saving time and potentially lives ” leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using starsaver he says “ i want to build a notforprofit inexpensive battery powered starstream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world making that water dualuse you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide ” humanitarianedit leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives hidden bugging devices and for the location of buried catastrophe victims in avalanches mudslides collapsed buildings etc he invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water key for example to protecting services cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones key collaborator paul white he has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed including one now sold by kongsberg for archaeological and civil engineering purposes with his research associate dr craig dolder he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and low and middleincome countries environmentaledit leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks from pipelines and from methane seeps by their acoustic emissions he invented systems to assess leakage from carbon capture and storage facilities and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed this is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and eventually the atmosphere in the seabed there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel yet as a greenhouse gas methane is  times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide so assessing how much is in the seabed and how much leaks into the atmosphere is a key task he made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean this is important for climate change modelling because over  million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean he worked as part of the team investigating whether manmade sounds can adversely affect benthic species marine life that inhabits the seabed such species have been overlooked in studies on how manmade sounds affect whales dolphins and fish benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species furthermore benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment turning it over and preventing it stagnating and are key to the health of coastal marine environments key collaborator paul white other inventionsedit by predicting the soundscapes of other worlds  and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds he identified key uses of sound by whales  and dolphins he invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source  billion at the oak ridge national laboratory in the us leadershipedit in addition to founding and leading his research group after standing down as associate dean for research for his faculty in  where he achieved his stated aim of making his faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national ref research census leighton founded two organizations which he leads namripedit the network for antimicrobial resistance and infection prevention namrip is a strategic research group with the sole aim of combatting antimicrobial resistance amr and promoting infection prevention as leighton said at namrips  conference “ unless preventative measures are found and noone in the world currently knows what those will be amr will through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’ by  be killing more people than cancer and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy we will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics common medical procedures minor surgery childbirth will become significantly more hazardous and advances in treatments such as those for childhood leukaemia will become reversed ” he set up namrip to search for the required solution with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oftcited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics as quoted by new scientist he explained “ i looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billiondollar fund for new antibiotics it would not sort out the problem it might just buy us an extra decade we need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in ” “ in many parts of the world climate change and flooding war corruption politics received wisdom traditions and religious practices and the supply of fuel and money play a far greater role in food water waste treatment healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another than do the outputs of the drug companies the twin potential catastrophes are global and so are the causes the solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce they lie with farmers plumbers office workers water and sewage workers medical practitioners food retailers innovators in business … indeed most of us and they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies ” in its first year namrip has grown to  members engineers chemists microbiologists environmental scientists veterinary and human medics clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions experts in food ethics and law crucially networked with economists geographers health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to amr and infection prevention offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams with almost weekly publications and successes namrip has delivered in terms of conducting research engaging with industry to roll out solutions to society and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach education and dialogue in  leighton began a plan to roll out namrip’s mission worldwide particularly to lowmiddle income countries with notforprofit interventions through the formation of globalnamrip hefuaedit health effects of ultrasound in air hefua has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing and that current guidelines are inadequate outreachedit leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage and possibly follow careers in science and engineering with school visits science fairs and appearances on tv and radio awards and honoursedit leighton has been awarded the following medals and

degree in natural sciences with honours in physics and theoretical physics in  he stayed on to work in the cavendish laboratory and was awarded a phd in  for image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography career and researchedit following his phd leighton was awarded senior and advanced research fellowships at magdalene college cambridge and the epsrc leighton joined the institute of sound and vibration research isvr at the university of southampton in  as a lecturer in underwater acoustics and completed the monograph the acoustic bubble in the same year he was awarded a personal chair at the age of  and has authored over  publications he has founded and leads a research group and two research organizations namrip and hefua see below he conducts extensive outreach activities particularly for schoolchildren features on radio and video and serves on numerous national and international committees an example lecture can be found at on the web the breadth of his research covers medical humanitarian and environmental sciences beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications his research interests cover acoustical oceanography antimicrobial resistancecitation needed biomedical ultrasound carbon capture and storagecitation needed climate changecitation needed decontaminationcitation needed hospital acquired infectionscitation needed marine zoologycitation needed ultrasound and underwater acoustics the citation of the  paterson medal of the institute of physics states that “ timothy leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth his is an acknowledged world leader in four fields he has delivered over  pioneering advances from devices now used in hospitals to the worlds first count of bubbles in the surf zone crucial to our understanding of atmosphereocean gas flux coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar behind these advances lies rigorous physics ” he strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications as his time as associate dean demonstrated but he also champions generating impact from researchcitation needed leighton strongly believescitation needed that if a technology is to help many people it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers and be sufficiently easy to use no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science that cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit rd funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup rd investmentcitation needed therefore whilst he places high value on quality journal publications these must form part of a publication strategycitation needed with the exception of namrip see below leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changerscitation needed because he believescitation needed that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is in much of research a route to only incremental advances “ we need to work with rigour imagination and wonder unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names or the history of projects in which we have previously worked or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem then when we eventually do find a solution we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us ” leightons research has been funded by the royal society the united states department of energycitation needed the science and technology facilities council the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and the natural environment research council nerc he has also selffunded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor  he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventionscitation

for detecting bone disease including osteoporosis he invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy an invention that won the  ‘medical  healthcare’ award from ‘the engineer’ key collaborator guys and st thomas nhs foundation trust his scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needlefree injectors for migraine sufferers over  million sold he assisted the institute of cancer research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring  he was a coauthor of the world federation for ultrasound in medicine and biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning since which time  billion mothers and children have been scannedcitation needed he identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them he advises the health protection agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the international commission on nonionizing radiation protectioncitation needed starstream device in  leighton is currentlywhen developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning cleaning without heat or additives saving water energy and cost and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking watercitation needed when cleaning cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target transplant organs microchips etc which could not withstand heat or chemicals most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currentlywhen confidential as a result of patenting restrictions but starstream is securely patented in many countries it cleans down a stream of water and in tests cleans whilst saving up to  water and electricity costscitation needed with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water one use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning as new scientist quoted leighton “  were supposed to wash our hands for at least  seconds in hot soapy water – but in the uk the average is  seconds in cold water it’s not enough and despite all the advertising you can’t change people’s behaviour our answer is to change the water ” starstream won the institution of chemical engineers award for water management and supply the royal society brian mercer award for innovation and the slab product of the year  multidisciplinary teams have shown that starstream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant removing bacterial biofilms cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of creutzfeldt–jakob disease prion it has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls although safe for hands starstream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath which is too hazardous for immersion of hands in a sidebyside comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track a problem which costs the uk rail network £ million each year the managing director of ultrawave ltd john melvile described starstream as “  the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades saving time and potentially lives ” leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using starsaver he says “ i want to build a notforprofit inexpensive battery powered starstream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world making that water dualuse you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide ” humanitarianedit leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives hidden bugging devices and for the location of buried catastrophe victims in avalanches mudslides collapsed buildings etc he invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water key for example to protecting services cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones key collaborator paul white he has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed including one now sold by kongsberg for archaeological and civil engineering purposes with his research associate dr craig dolder he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and low and middleincome countries environmentaledit leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks from pipelines and from methane seeps by their acoustic emissions he invented systems to assess leakage from carbon capture and storage facilities and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed this is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and eventually the atmosphere in the seabed there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel yet as a greenhouse gas methane is  times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide so assessing how much is in the seabed and how much leaks into the atmosphere is a key task he made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean this is important for climate change modelling because over  million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean he worked as part of the team investigating whether manmade sounds can adversely affect benthic species marine life that inhabits the seabed such species have been overlooked in studies on how manmade sounds affect whales dolphins and fish benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species furthermore benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment turning it over and preventing it stagnating and are key to the health of coastal marine environments key collaborator paul white other inventionsedit by predicting the soundscapes of other worlds  and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds he identified key uses of sound by whales  and dolphins he invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source  billion at the oak ridge national laboratory in the us leadershipedit in addition to founding and leading his research group after standing down as associate dean for research for his faculty in  where he achieved his stated aim of making his faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national ref research census leighton founded two organizations which he leads namripedit the network for antimicrobial resistance and infection prevention namrip is a strategic research group with the sole aim of combatting antimicrobial resistance amr and promoting infection prevention as leighton said at namrips  conference “ unless preventative measures are found and noone in the world currently knows what those will be amr will through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’ by  be killing more people than cancer and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy we will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics common medical procedures minor surgery childbirth will become significantly more hazardous and advances in treatments such as those for childhood leukaemia will become reversed ” he set up namrip to search for the required solution with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oftcited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics as quoted by new scientist he explained “ i looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billiondollar fund for new antibiotics it would not sort out the problem it might just buy us an extra decade we need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in ” “ in many parts of the world climate change and flooding war corruption politics received wisdom traditions and religious practices and the supply of fuel and money play a far greater role in food water waste treatment healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another than do the outputs of the drug companies the twin potential catastrophes are global and so are the causes the solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce they lie with farmers plumbers office workers water and sewage workers medical practitioners food retailers innovators in business … indeed most of us and they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies ” in its first year namrip has grown to  members engineers chemists microbiologists environmental scientists veterinary and human medics clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions experts in food ethics and law crucially networked with economists geographers health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to amr and infection prevention offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams with almost weekly publications and successes namrip has delivered in terms of conducting research engaging with industry to roll out solutions to society and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach education and dialogue in  leighton began a plan to roll out namrip’s mission worldwide particularly to lowmiddle income countries with notforprofit interventions through the formation of globalnamrip hefuaedit health effects of ultrasound in air hefua has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing and that current guidelines are inadequate outreachedit leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage and possibly follow careers in science and engineering with school visits science fairs and appearances on tv and radio awards and honoursedit leighton has been awarded the following medals and

degree in natural sciences with honours in physics and theoretical physics in  he stayed on to work in the cavendish laboratory and was awarded a phd in  for image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography career and researchedit following his phd leighton was awarded senior and advanced research fellowships at magdalene college cambridge and the epsrc leighton joined the institute of sound and vibration research isvr at the university of southampton in  as a lecturer in underwater acoustics and completed the monograph the acoustic bubble in the same year he was awarded a personal chair at the age of  and has authored over  publications he has founded and leads a research group and two research organizations namrip and hefua see below he conducts extensive outreach activities particularly for schoolchildren features on radio and video and serves on numerous national and international committees an example lecture can be found at on the web the breadth of his research covers medical humanitarian and environmental sciences beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications his research interests cover acoustical oceanography antimicrobial resistancecitation needed biomedical ultrasound carbon capture and storagecitation needed climate changecitation needed decontaminationcitation needed hospital acquired infectionscitation needed marine zoologycitation needed ultrasound and underwater acoustics the citation of the  paterson medal of the institute of physics states that “ timothy leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth his is an acknowledged world leader in four fields he has delivered over  pioneering advances from devices now used in hospitals to the worlds first count of bubbles in the surf zone crucial to our understanding of atmosphereocean gas flux coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar behind these advances lies rigorous physics ” he strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications as his time as associate dean demonstrated but he also champions generating impact from researchcitation needed leighton strongly believescitation needed that if a technology is to help many people it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers and be sufficiently easy to use no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science that cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit rd funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup rd investmentcitation needed therefore whilst he places high value on quality journal publications these must form part of a publication strategycitation needed with the exception of namrip see below leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changerscitation needed because he believescitation needed that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is in much of research a route to only incremental advances “ we need to work with rigour imagination and wonder unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names or the history of projects in which we have previously worked or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem then when we eventually do find a solution we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us ” leightons research has been funded by the royal society the united states department of energycitation needed the science and technology facilities council the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and the natural environment research council nerc he has also selffunded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor  he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventionscitation

for detecting bone disease including osteoporosis he invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy an invention that won the  ‘medical  healthcare’ award from ‘the engineer’ key collaborator guys and st thomas nhs foundation trust his scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needlefree injectors for migraine sufferers over  million sold he assisted the institute of cancer research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring  he was a coauthor of the world federation for ultrasound in medicine and biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning since which time  billion mothers and children have been scannedcitation needed he identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them he advises the health protection agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the international commission on nonionizing radiation protectioncitation needed starstream device in  leighton is currentlywhen developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning cleaning without heat or additives saving water energy and cost and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking watercitation needed when cleaning cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target transplant organs microchips etc which could not withstand heat or chemicals most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currentlywhen confidential as a result of patenting restrictions but starstream is securely patented in many countries it cleans down a stream of water and in tests cleans whilst saving up to  water and electricity costscitation needed with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water one use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning as new scientist quoted leighton “  were supposed to wash our hands for at least  seconds in hot soapy water – but in the uk the average is  seconds in cold water it’s not enough and despite all the advertising you can’t change people’s behaviour our answer is to change the water ” starstream won the institution of chemical engineers award for water management and supply the royal society brian mercer award for innovation and the slab product of the year  multidisciplinary teams have shown that starstream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant removing bacterial biofilms cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of creutzfeldt–jakob disease prion it has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls although safe for hands starstream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath which is too hazardous for immersion of hands in a sidebyside comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track a problem which costs the uk rail network £ million each year the managing director of ultrawave ltd john melvile described starstream as “  the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades saving time and potentially lives ” leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using starsaver he says “ i want to build a notforprofit inexpensive battery powered starstream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world making that water dualuse you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide ” humanitarianedit leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives hidden bugging devices and for the location of buried catastrophe victims in avalanches mudslides collapsed buildings etc he invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water key for example to protecting services cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones key collaborator paul white he has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed including one now sold by kongsberg for archaeological and civil engineering purposes with his research associate dr craig dolder he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and low and middleincome countries environmentaledit leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks from pipelines and from methane seeps by their acoustic emissions he invented systems to assess leakage from carbon capture and storage facilities and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed this is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and eventually the atmosphere in the seabed there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel yet as a greenhouse gas methane is  times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide so assessing how much is in the seabed and how much leaks into the atmosphere is a key task he made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean this is important for climate change modelling because over  million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean he worked as part of the team investigating whether manmade sounds can adversely affect benthic species marine life that inhabits the seabed such species have been overlooked in studies on how manmade sounds affect whales dolphins and fish benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species furthermore benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment turning it over and preventing it stagnating and are key to the health of coastal marine environments key collaborator paul white other inventionsedit by predicting the soundscapes of other worlds  and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds he identified key uses of sound by whales  and dolphins he invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source  billion at the oak ridge national laboratory in the us leadershipedit in addition to founding and leading his research group after standing down as associate dean for research for his faculty in  where he achieved his stated aim of making his faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national ref research census leighton founded two organizations which he leads namripedit the network for antimicrobial resistance and infection prevention namrip is a strategic research group with the sole aim of combatting antimicrobial resistance amr and promoting infection prevention as leighton said at namrips  conference “ unless preventative measures are found and noone in the world currently knows what those will be amr will through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’ by  be killing more people than cancer and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy we will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics common medical procedures minor surgery childbirth will become significantly more hazardous and advances in treatments such as those for childhood leukaemia will become reversed ” he set up namrip to search for the required solution with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oftcited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics as quoted by new scientist he explained “ i looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billiondollar fund for new antibiotics it would not sort out the problem it might just buy us an extra decade we need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in ” “ in many parts of the world climate change and flooding war corruption politics received wisdom traditions and religious practices and the supply of fuel and money play a far greater role in food water waste treatment healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another than do the outputs of the drug companies the twin potential catastrophes are global and so are the causes the solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce they lie with farmers plumbers office workers water and sewage workers medical practitioners food retailers innovators in business … indeed most of us and they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies ” in its first year namrip has grown to  members engineers chemists microbiologists environmental scientists veterinary and human medics clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions experts in food ethics and law crucially networked with economists geographers health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to amr and infection prevention offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams with almost weekly publications and successes namrip has delivered in terms of conducting research engaging with industry to roll out solutions to society and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach education and dialogue in  leighton began a plan to roll out namrip’s mission worldwide particularly to lowmiddle income countries with notforprofit interventions through the formation of globalnamrip hefuaedit health effects of ultrasound in air hefua has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing and that current guidelines are inadequate outreachedit leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage and

degree in natural sciences with honours in physics and theoretical physics in  he stayed on to work in the cavendish laboratory and was awarded a phd in  for image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography career and researchedit following his phd leighton was awarded senior and advanced research fellowships at magdalene college cambridge and the epsrc leighton joined the institute of sound and vibration research isvr at the university of southampton in  as a lecturer in underwater acoustics and completed the monograph the acoustic bubble in the same year he was awarded a personal chair at the age of  and has authored over  publications he has founded and leads a research group and two research organizations namrip and hefua see below he conducts extensive outreach activities particularly for schoolchildren features on radio and video and serves on numerous national and international committees an example lecture can be found at on the web the breadth of his research covers medical humanitarian and environmental sciences beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications his research interests cover acoustical oceanography antimicrobial resistancecitation needed biomedical ultrasound carbon capture and storagecitation needed climate changecitation needed decontaminationcitation needed hospital acquired infectionscitation needed marine zoologycitation needed ultrasound and underwater acoustics the citation of the  paterson medal of the institute of physics states that “ timothy leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth his is an acknowledged world leader in four fields he has delivered over  pioneering advances from devices now used in hospitals to the worlds first count of bubbles in the surf zone crucial to our understanding of atmosphereocean gas flux coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar behind these advances lies rigorous physics ” he strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications as his time as associate dean demonstrated but he also champions generating impact from researchcitation needed leighton strongly believescitation needed that if a technology is to help many people it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers and be sufficiently easy to use no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science that cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit rd funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup rd investmentcitation needed therefore whilst he places high value on quality journal publications these must form part of a publication strategycitation needed with the exception of namrip see below leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changerscitation needed because he believescitation needed that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is in much of research a route to only incremental advances “ we need to work with rigour imagination and wonder unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names or the history of projects in which we have previously worked or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem then when we eventually do find a solution we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us ” leightons research has been funded by the royal society the united states department of energycitation needed the science and technology facilities council the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and the natural environment research council nerc he has also selffunded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor  he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventionscitation

for detecting bone disease including osteoporosis he invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy an invention that won the  ‘medical  healthcare’ award from ‘the engineer’ key collaborator guys and st thomas nhs foundation trust his scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needlefree injectors for migraine sufferers over  million sold he assisted the institute of cancer research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring  he was a coauthor of the world federation for ultrasound in medicine and biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning since which time  billion mothers and children have been scannedcitation needed he identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them he advises the health protection agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the international commission on nonionizing radiation protectioncitation needed starstream device in  leighton is currentlywhen developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning cleaning without heat or additives saving water energy and cost and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking watercitation needed when cleaning cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target transplant organs microchips etc which could not withstand heat or chemicals most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currentlywhen confidential as a result of patenting restrictions but starstream is securely patented in many countries it cleans down a stream of water and in tests cleans whilst saving up to  water and electricity costscitation needed with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water one use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning as new scientist quoted leighton “  were supposed to wash our hands for at least  seconds in hot soapy water – but in the uk the average is  seconds in cold water it’s not enough and despite all the advertising you can’t change people’s behaviour our answer is to change the water ” starstream won the institution of chemical engineers award for water management and supply the royal society brian mercer award for innovation and the slab product of the year  multidisciplinary teams have shown that starstream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant removing bacterial biofilms cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of creutzfeldt–jakob disease prion it has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls although safe for hands starstream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath which is too hazardous for immersion of hands in a sidebyside comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track a problem which costs the uk rail network £ million each year the managing director of ultrawave ltd john melvile described starstream as “  the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades saving time and potentially lives ” leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using starsaver he says “ i want to build a notforprofit inexpensive battery powered starstream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world making that water dualuse you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide ” humanitarianedit leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives hidden bugging devices and for the location of buried catastrophe victims in avalanches mudslides collapsed buildings etc he invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water key for example to protecting services cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones key collaborator paul white he has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed including one now sold by kongsberg for archaeological and civil engineering purposes with his research associate dr craig dolder he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and low and middleincome countries environmentaledit leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks from pipelines and from methane seeps by their acoustic emissions he invented systems to assess leakage from carbon capture and storage facilities and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed this is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and eventually the atmosphere in the seabed there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel yet as a greenhouse gas methane is  times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide so assessing how much is in the seabed and how much leaks into the atmosphere is a key task he made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean this is important for climate change modelling because over  million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean he worked as part of the team investigating whether manmade sounds can adversely affect benthic species marine life that inhabits the seabed such species have been overlooked in studies on how manmade sounds affect whales dolphins and fish benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species furthermore benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment turning it over and preventing it stagnating and are key to the health of coastal marine environments key collaborator paul white other inventionsedit by predicting the soundscapes of other worlds  and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds he identified key uses of sound by whales  and dolphins he invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source  billion at the oak ridge national laboratory in the us leadershipedit in addition to founding and leading his research group after standing down as associate dean for research for his faculty in  where he achieved his stated aim of making his faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national ref research census leighton founded two organizations which he leads namripedit the network for antimicrobial resistance and infection prevention namrip is a strategic research group with the sole aim of combatting antimicrobial resistance amr and promoting infection prevention as leighton said at namrips  conference “ unless preventative measures are found and noone in the world currently knows what those will be amr will through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’ by  be killing more people than cancer and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy we will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics common medical procedures minor surgery childbirth will become significantly more hazardous and advances in treatments such as those for childhood leukaemia will become reversed ” he set up namrip to search for the required solution with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oftcited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics as quoted by new scientist he explained “ i looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billiondollar fund for new antibiotics it would not sort out the problem it might just buy us an extra decade we need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in ” “ in many parts of the world climate change and flooding war corruption politics received wisdom traditions and religious practices and the supply of fuel and money play a far greater role in food water waste treatment healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another than do the outputs of the drug companies the twin potential catastrophes are global and so are the causes the solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce they lie with farmers plumbers office workers water and sewage workers medical practitioners food retailers innovators in business … indeed most of us and they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies ” in its first year namrip has grown to  members engineers chemists microbiologists environmental scientists veterinary and human medics clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions experts in food ethics and law crucially networked with economists geographers health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to amr and infection prevention offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams with almost weekly publications and successes namrip has delivered in terms of conducting research engaging with industry to roll out solutions to society and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach education and dialogue in  leighton began a plan to roll out namrip’s mission worldwide particularly to lowmiddle income countries with notforprofit interventions through the formation of globalnamrip hefuaedit health effects of ultrasound in air hefua has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing and that current guidelines are inadequate outreachedit leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage and possibly follow careers in science and engineering with school visits science fairs and appearances on tv and radio awards and honoursedit leighton has been awarded the following medals and distinctions medalsedit the  rayleigh medal of the institute of acoustics the  helmholtzrayleigh interdisciplinary silver medal of the acoustical society of america the  r w b stephens medal of the

acoustical society of america fellowshipsedit leighton was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in  his nomination reads “ timothy leighton is distinguished for his research on the acoustical physics of bubbles especially their nonlinear behaviour for his inventions and discoveries including bubble measurements in the surf zone pipelines and methane seeps for shock wave lithotripsy monitoring disease detection in cancellous bone and needle free injection for sonar systems that overcome bubble masking and numerous industrial applications his seminal monograph the acoustic bubble
