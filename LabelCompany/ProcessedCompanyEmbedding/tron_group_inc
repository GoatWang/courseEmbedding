expenditures relating to i acquisition of inventory ii developmental expenses associated with a startup business and iii marketing expenses we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances thereafter we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet longterm operating requirements additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations we will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations we currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding however we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock we have and will continue to seek to obtain shortterm loans from our officers directors although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made we do not have any agreements with our officers and directors concerning these loans we do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that

company” we are not required to provide the information required by this item   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of march   as defined in rules ae and de under the  securities exchange act of   as amended the exchange act based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of march   that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our securities and exchange commission sec reports i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure        table of contents   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that     · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company   · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and   · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk   our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march   based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control – integrated framework –  coso  framework and sec guidance on conducting such assessments   based upon such evaluation our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of march   based on the coso framework criteria as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of majority of independent members  lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives affecting authorization recordkeeping custody of assets and reconciliations  ineffective controls over yearend financial disclosure and reporting processes and  management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of march     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended march   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting        table of contents   part ii  other information   item  legal proceedings   management is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority

involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors including the risks in the section entitled “risk factors” that may cause our or our industry’s actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements   although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements except as required by applicable law including the securities laws of the united states we do not intend to update any of the forwardlooking statements to conform these statements to actual results   our financial statements are stated in united states dollars us and are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles   in this annual report unless otherwise specified all dollar amounts are expressed in united states dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock   as used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated the terms “we” “us” and “our” mean tron group inc unless otherwise indicated   general overview   we were incorporated under the name plush corporation on october   under the laws of the state of nevada our business consisted of designing marketing and selling luxury accessories for men online management has decided not to pursue this line of products and has discontinued operations involving luxury accessories   november   a majority of stockholders of our company and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company from plush corp to tron group inc an increase to authorized capital from  shares of common stock par value  to  shares of common stock par value  and a forward stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of one  old share for twenty  new shares of common stock   a certificate of amendment increasing our authorized capital and changing the name of our company was filed with the nevada secretary of state with an effective date of december     the name change and forward stock split became effective with the otc markets at the opening of trading on december   and our trading symbol was changed to tgrp our new cusip number is     our principal executive offices are located at k nd floor kuchai business park jalan  off jalan kuchai lama kuala lumpur  our telephone number is      we have never declared bankruptcy been in receivership or involved in any kind of legal proceeding        table of contents    our current business   tron group inc is a holding company and has no principal business we are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for the merger with or acquisition of a target business in certain instances a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge we have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements   any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing there can be no assurance however that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation if our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds our business may fail   management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the otc bulletin board such as i the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses ii increased visibility in the financial community iii the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions iv potentially improved trading efficiency v potential stockholder liquidity vi potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition vii potential compensation of key employees through stock options viii potentially enhanced corporate image and ix a presence in the united states capital market   we may seek a business opportunity with entities who have recently commenced operations or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities to develop a new product or service or for other corporate purposes we may acquire assets and establish whollyowned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries   in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity we may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity we may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business upon the consummation of a transaction it is likely that our present management will no longer be in control of our company in addition it is likely that our officers and directors will as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors   as of the date hereof we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity when any such agreement is reached we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on form k with the securities and exchange commission   we anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success we believe that there are numerous firms in various industries seeking the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered corporation business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want we can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities   currently we do not have a source of revenue we are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations historically we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through private placements of our equity stock but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise funds privately further we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital until we locate a prospective property through which we can pursue our plan of operation if we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail

operating activities increased   to  during the fiscal year  mainly due to an increase in net loss   financing activities   cash flows provided by financing activities increased  to  during the fiscal year  mainly due to an increase in contribution from shareholder and proceed from related parties   the report of our auditors on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   contains a going concern qualification as we have suffered losses since our inception we have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities for these reasons our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing   plan of operation and funding   we expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business   existing working capital further advances and debt instruments and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months we have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements generally we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments in connection with our business plan management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to i acquisition of inventory ii developmental expenses associated with a startup business and iii marketing expenses we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances thereafter we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet longterm operating requirements additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavours or opportunities which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations we will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations we currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding however we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock we have and will continue to seek to obtain shortterm loans from our officers directors although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made we do not have any agreements with our officers and directors concerning these loans we do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing        table of contents    going concern   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended december   this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain sufficient debt or equity financing to fund our operating expenses this is because we have no material assets operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover our operations   the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining financing or acquiring a new business and achieving a break even or profitable level of operations in that new business the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders it is not probable we would be able to obtaining traditional loans from financial institutions because we have no business operations no assets and no revenues   there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing through private placements bank financing or other loans necessary to support our working capital requirements to the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements public offerings andor bank financing are insufficient we will have to raise additional working capital no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or if available will be on terms acceptable to us

reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap    use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the

accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements   the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash

instruments   asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable   level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions   the company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis   concentrations of credit risks   the company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future the company places its cash with financial institutions of high credit worthiness at times its cash with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits the company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds and as such it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited   loss per share   the company has adopted asc  “earnings per share” “eps” which requires presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation in the accompanying financial statements basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period   the company has no potentially dilutive securities such as options or warrants currently issued and outstanding   related party transaction   the company follows asc  related party disclosures for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  “accounting for income taxes” the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are

income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax

internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that     · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company         · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and         · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk        table of contents    our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control – integrated framework –  coso  framework and sec guidance on conducting such assessments   based upon such evaluation our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the coso framework criteria as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of majority of independent members  lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives affecting authorization recordkeeping custody of assets and reconciliations  ineffective controls over yearend financial disclosure and reporting processes and  management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of december     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting
