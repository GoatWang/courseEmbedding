apart from their parents for jorge del alamo jr acct ’ the lesson came earlier in  del alamo’s family sent the yearold his sister and their cousin away from fidel castro’s cuba to the united states the children lived in orphanages for six months until their parents could join them jorge and lin del alamo “that was an eyeopening experience going from a place where people were really looking after you to where if say you didn’t like the food and want to eat that’s just your problem” del alamo recalled “but looking back it makes you a better person” his family eventually settled in danville va where his father — an attorney in cuba — found work teaching spanish after high school del alamo took his first accounting class at a virginia tech satellite program in his hometown “it was like somebody turned on the light” recalled del alamo who transferred to blacksburg as a junior “i knew i wanted to be an accountant … it’s a very logical field of study things are supposed to balance that squares with my personality which is pretty orderly” del alamo’s skill at accounting and fluency in spanish helped him excel at kpmg where he was a partner for  years and did tax work for international firms he lives in corpus christi texas but makes sure to stop by blacksburg on regular visits to his parents who now live in charlottesville del alamo credits virginia tech with preparing him to succeed and he is a major supporter of the department of accounting and information systems he has given to the kpmg professorship held by larry killough and has endowed an accounting scholarship he and his wife lin have created an excellence fund to benefit the department and recently pledged  million in future support for a professorship in accounting “you look back and realize you don’t do all this on your own” del alamo said “you owe this to a lot of other people like your parents but also to the university for the great education and opportunity to gain confidence and mature and learn the value of hard work” – by albert raboteau development communications return to skip menu search go return to skip menu related stories and links pdf of this article article
