stonepine capital management sends letter to board of directors of cornerstone therapeutics inc  business wire stonepine capital management sends letter to board of directors of cornerstone therapeutics inc says offer from majority owner chiesi too low urges independent directors to obtain significantly higher price in an effort to protect minority shareholders february    am eastern standard time sausalito califbusiness wirestonepine capital management llc “stonepine” sent a letter to the board of directors of cornerstone therapeutics inc “cornerstone” on monday february  in the letter stonepine expressed serious concerns for the minority shareholders of cornerstone as it relates to a potential transaction with its majority owner chiesi farmaceutici spa “chiesi” the full text of the letter follows february   via electronic delivery  overnight mail board of directorsco andrew powell corporate secretarycornerstone therapeutics inc crescent green drive suite cary nc  to the directors of cornerstone therapeutics we are the principals of stonepine capital management llc “stonepine” a healthcare focused investment firm we are minority shareholders of cornerstone therapeutics inc “cornerstone” and own  shares we note the recent proposal by chiesi farmaceutici spa “chiesi” in which chiesi proposes to acquire  of the common stock of cornerstone that it does not already own for  to  per share in cash as minority shareholders of cornerstone we appreciate that chiesi also sees tremendous value in cornerstone and is interested in acquiring the company however we have serious concerns for the minority shareholders as it relates to this potential transaction  the chiesi proposal grossly undervalues cornerstone assuming the high end of the proposed acquisition range or  per share cornerstone would be sold for approximately  times expected  revenues on an enterprise value basis taking into consideration the company’s debt and  times expected  revenues on a market capitalization basis in a sector where companies and pharmaceutical products are often sold in the range of  to  times revenues chiesi’s opening offer range is much too low for example an offer for cornerstone at  times expected  revenues on an enterprise value basis would constitute an offer value far more typical for the sector equating to an approximate  per share acquisition price for cornerstone  wall street believes the chiesi proposal is a “lowball offer” that “should be rejected by cornerstone shareholders” a recent research report by ladenburg thalmann “ladenburg” the only sellside firm that covers cornerstone concludes that the current offer is a “low ball offer“ and “should be rejected by cornerstone shareholders” ladenburg conducted “sum of parts” “peak sales” and “discounted cash flow” analyses of the company resulting in valuations ranging from  to  per share with a  per share price target ultimately assigned to the company chiesi states in their offer letter that “cornerstone would be best positioned for long term growth and development as a private company and would benefit substantially from the synergies and shared resources that would result from this transaction with chiesi” chiesi is not offering to share enough of this benefit with cornerstone’s minority shareholders  chiesi has effectively blocked the ability of cornerstone to run an auction process with other potential bidders or conduct traditional “market checks” regarding the fair acquisition value of cornerstone we understand that cornerstone is deemed a “controlled company” within the meaning of the applicable rules of nasdaq as more than  in this case  of the voting power of the company is held by chiesi in addition chiesi has certain control rights through cornerstone’s certificate of incorporation namely the ability to block any substantial sale or disposition of cornerstone assets we also understand that craig collard cornerstone’s ceo is subject to a stockholders agreement with chiesi which requires mr collard to vote his quite substantial ownership of cornerstone in favor of a transaction whereby chiesi or its affiliates would acquire all of the outstanding stock of cornerstone lastly chiesi made the following quite clear in its offer letter to cornerstone “please note we are interested in acquiring the remaining shares of cornerstone and we have no interest in a disposition of our controlling interest or in considering any other strategic transaction involving cornerstone” this collectively has created a situation whereby chiesi is the only feasible acquirer of cornerstone as a board you will be unable to effectively conduct a competitive auction process or conduct meaningful “market checks” to ensure that the minority shareholders are obtaining the best value for a potential sale to chiesi consequently it is incumbent upon the independent directors of the board to ensure that a fair value for cornerstone is negotiated with chiesi compared to cornerstone remaining a standalone entity we are in favor of cornerstone remaining a standalone entity if the independent directors of cornerstone cannot obtain a substantial improvement in the offer terms from chiesi  we are concerned as to whether cornerstone has established sufficient governance procedures within the board of directors to conduct a robust and fair negotiation process with chiesi we note from your proxy statement of april  that the board has determined that mr codeanne mr enright mr harper mr heffernan and mr stephan are “independent directors” as it relates to nasdaq rules indicating that such persons do not have a relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director however as a director of chiesi pharmaceuticals inc usa a subsidiary of chiesi we believe that mr stephan is highly conflicted in the current situation and should be recused from all deliberations and negotiations regarding the chiesi proposal this is particularly important given that a group of truly independent directors should be solely responsible for negotiating a potential transaction with chiesi in order to manage the obvious conflicts of interest present in this situation we note from your february  press release that the board has established a special committee comprised of five independent directors in order to coordinate a response to chiesi however you have not disclosed the director composition of the special committee we believe it is important to disclose to cornerstone’s minority shareholders the composition of the special committee and that it be comprised of truly independent directors that are not conflicted  chiesi has unique access to advanced confidential information regarding cornerstone therefore the minority shareholders are at a substantial disadvantage in evaluating any deal terms chiesi’s offer letter states that they have “…conducted an extensive review of cornerstone based upon publicly available information…” in fact chiesi likely has broad confidential access to cornerstone’s improving operational and financial results well in advance of cornerstone’s quarterly reports to its public shareholders for example two of cornerstone’s board members are key executives at chiesi dr anton giorgio failla head of corporate development and marco vecchia head of legal and corporate affairs and a third cornerstone board member robert m stephan serves as a board member of chiesi pharmaceuticals inc a subsidiary of chiesi these three cornerstone board members all have insider access to cornerstone’s confidential information while at the same time performing key roles for chiesi in addition chiesi is the licensor of two of cornerstone’s key products curosurf and bethkis by way of the related product license and distribution agreements between the two companies chiesi has unique advanced knowledge regarding the performance metrics for these products these dynamics put chiesi in the advantageous position of being able to quickly evaluate and bid on cornerstone’s improving business to the potential detriment of minority shareholders we sincerely hope that the board puts the company’s minority shareholders on an equal footing with chiesi as it relates to the negotiation of chiesi’s acquisition proposal summary in summary we view the current offer from chiesi as grossly undervaluing cornerstone furthermore we believe that the construction of the company’s ownership and board create unique challenges to navigating this process in a way that is fair and equitable to the minority shareholders we appeal to the independent directors of the company to thoughtfully consider these issues in representing the minority shareholders of cornerstone we would be happy to discuss this further with you or any subset of the board at your convenience best regards     timothy p lynch jon m plexico managing
