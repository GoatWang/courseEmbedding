microagentallows you to place an agent into a maintenance mode aka blackout periods during which monitoring activity is suppressed it supports fully configurable maintenance mode policies and all maintenance mode activity can be monitored using standard rulebases example use case the administrators need to perform an emergency maintenance operation on a database during which they do not want the agent to report on database related problems or attempt to restart the database by placing the agent or one of its rulebases into maintenance mode for a limited time the alerts and corrective actions are suppressed without the need to manually alter the agent’s configuration or stop the agent command mappercommand mapper provides a rich integration facility for scripts and custom executables customized microagents can be rapidly assembled out of a set of mapped scripts which may return either complex or tabular data for processing by the agent’s standard rules engine it is also very useful for training testing and rapid prototyping of management interfaces for application instrumentation logfile pluslogfile plus adds multiline monitoring and pattern frequency monitoring to the agent’s native log file monitoring capabilities detection of some application problems requires correlation across multiple lines of a log file other problems have a log file signature that is identified by the frequency of some error message logfile plus provides these capabilities with the ability to configure the number of lines over which correlation can occur and perpattern frequency intervals arepoarepo addresses an issue faced by nearly all large scale hawk implementations the problem of rulebase management the ease with which one can create modify and deploy rulebases with hawk can also lead to inconsistencies if strict change control procedures are not followed arepo effectively serves as a comprehensive monitor of your monitoring configuration it insures that your agents are indeed monitoring what you think they should be monitoring no more and no less it tracks rulebase versions and identifies inconsistencies it can be used interactively or with standard hawk rulebases to generate alerts when inconsistencies arise phi enhanced console ecec provides extensions to the standard tibco hawk console api it adds several useful features and event types for use by
