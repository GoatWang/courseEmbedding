lifestyles make higherlevel demands for nutrition and performance and lexaria energy hemp oilinfused products help fill that need we are a food sciences company focused on the delivery of hemp oil ingredients through gourmet foods based upon our proprietary technologies tea is healthy “the many bioactive compounds in tea appear to impact virtually every cell in the body to help improve health outcomes” jeffrey blumberg phd professor of nutrition science and policy at tufts university welcome to lexaria lexaria bioscience corp is a food biosciences company with a proprietary technology for improved delivery of bioactive compounds the company’s lipophilic enhancement technology has been shown to enhance the bioavailability of orally ingested cannabinoids while also masking taste cannabinoids are poorly absorbed by the body’s gastrointestinal tract and consumers often default to alternate routes of administration like smoking to achieve higher effectiveness food products lexaria has two distinct consumer product brands vipovatm and lexaria energy both brands use patent pending technology to infuse hemp oil ingredients within lipids in popular foods other companies selling hemp oil drops or products investors lexaria has been graced with the best shareholders on the planet our transition to become a leading food sciences company was made with you in mind find out more of our public company information here education lexaria delivers hemp oil ingredients through a patent pending process within gourmet food products our best customers are wellinformed about healthy eating choices and what hemp oil is let us help you in your quest for knowledge who we are lexaria corp was founded by determined people who have always worked hard to build value both for shareholders and for customers we have grown to become a revenuegenerating biosciences company focused intellectual property we live in an age where technology touches our lives constantly when it works well we dont notice the tech  we only notice the benefits most of us have forgotten that antilock brakes on our cars used to be hitech or that wireless internetwas once considered almost a miracle we know that delivering balanced nutrition in a single package to the human body can be challenging lexaria has already taken a giant first step in a process we believe makes us unique in the entire marketplace we actually have a patentpending method by which we infuse the healthy cocktail of molecules in our organically sourced hemp oil inside the molecules of other ingredients we work with lipids because the human endocannabinoid system is itself lipid based we believe this is a more efficient way of delivering hemp oil ingredients to your body said another way a little hemp seed

suggesting though certainly not proving that our technology and formulation may be more effective in an actual gastrointestinal system than in an in vitro simulation below we explore why bioavailability is such an important consideration and how it affects more than you might at first imagine there are a number of important considerations to contemplate before making changes to your diet or consumption habits but one vital fact outweighs all the others the vast majority of the cannabidiol cbd or tetrahydrocannabinol thc that is consumed – via any method – ends up in your toilet explore how cannabinoids are ingested and absorbed different delivery mechanisms recent technological advances in bio absorption and how those advances offer users an alternative to smoking we need to understand what bioavailability is and how it differs from absorption they are related and similar – but different absorption is just one component of bioavailability to truly understand bioavailability we have to speak briefly about how the human body digests food the object of digestion is to transform large food particles into smaller molecules which can more easily be absorbed into your watersoluble blood plasma that is how you get nutrients and energy very little digestion actually occurs in your stomach which is designed in part to kill pathogens and foreign substances that should not be ingested in fact roughly  of all digestion happens in your small intestine digestive enzymes intermingle with your food during the roughly  hour journey to arrive at your small intestine breaking down the food and preparing it for absorption unfortunately hydrochloric acid in your stomach is also quite capable of destroying many nutritious fragile molecules before they can ever be absorbed there are dozens of different cannabinoid molecules and most of them share similar molecular characteristics in general cannabinoids do not tolerate acidic environments studies have shown poor recoveries or even  recoveries of cannabinoids in acidic environments detection and quantification of  synthetic cannabinoids and one metabolite jwh cooh in blood and urine j sobhani sefy the mouth and throat are a roughly neutral environment with a ph of roughly  stomach ph can be anywhere in the  –  range which is highly acidic in contrast the small intestine has a highly alkaline environment conducive to molecular absorption about  normal water is neutral or slightly alkaline and has a ph of  –  for scale a ph of  is ten times more alkaline than a ph of  and a ph of  is  times more acidic than a ph of  for these and other reasons digestionabsorptionbioavailability of cannabinoids in their unprocessed form is very low the molecules typically do not survive their passage through the stomach undamaged and are not free to be absorbed in the alkaline environment of the small intestine finally your liver has a major role to play in that it regulates what molecules are allowed to reach your general circulation after ingestion absorption through your small intestine and finally passage through the liver’s filtration systems it often wraps up what it identifies as dangerous molecules in watersoluble chemicals that are identified for ejection through urine the topic of cannabinoid absorption is well understood and has been repeatedly studied bioavailability of cbd or of thc varies greatly by delivery method smoking typically delivers cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of  huestis  chem biodivers – mcgilveray  pain res manag  suppl aa – a  cannabinoids that are absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth buccomucosal application have bioavailabilities of around  karschner et al   clin chem – by comparison orally consumed cannabis edibles typically deliver cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of only  karschner et al  clin chem – bioavailability from both vaping and sublingual drops fall inside the range established at the high and low ends by smoking and edible ingestion respectively absorption of cannabinoids through smoking burning is an oxidizing process is relatively high because the molecules are not required to pass through the hostile stomach environment and instead are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs although smoking is a relatively efficient and quick acting process it is also a wellknown health hazard of the one billion people around the world who smoke roughly six million people die each year from diseases caused directly by smoking more on that later this is a good place to summarize what we know so far in order to improve absorption levels via edible ingestion the cannabinoid molecule has to be protected for at least two hours while it passes through the acidic stomach environment final bioabsorption rates are comprised of several operations including survival of a given molecule through the gi system absorption through the walls of the small intestine a selective filtering process by the liver and even more processes are required to put that molecule to useful work within your body because of the above historically smoking has been the most effective way to absorb cannabinoids into the body roughly  of cannabinoids are absorbed via smoking compared to only a  rate via edible ingestion smoking is a serious health hazard and many nonusers find it objectionable the goals of higher bioavailability of cannabinoids are thus threefold to mollify objections to its smoking from noncannabis users  to reduce unhealthy hazards of smoking and to more consistently deliver a higher proportion of useful molecules comprised from lower overall dosages that place less of a load on the liver the challenges associated with efficient delivery of cannabinoids and the benefits to be experienced both by consumers and society through overcoming those challenges are now well understood lexaria has focused on discovering new technologies that can more efficiently deliver cannabinoids to the bloodstream where they can have their desired effect our pointedly focused research is devoted to understanding of the human endocannabinoid system and how it can function at a higher level through the efficient and healthy ingestion of cannabinoids to this end our recent in vitro lab experiments have greatly expanded our understanding of the most efficient ways to deliver cannabinoids through ingestion in order to succeed in delivering a higher percentage of ingested cannabinoids into the human bloodstream we first need to figure out how to protect the cannabinoid molecule on its journey through the gastrointestinal system it is well known that ingesting fats the terms “fats” and “lipids” can often though not always be used synonymously while simultaneously ingesting other focusedupon substances can often lead to higher absorption levels of those key substances“the us fda recommended high fat meals for foodeffect studies because such fatty meals – cal – fat – carbohydrates and – proteins affect gi physiology and maximize drug transfer into the systemic circulation” food and drug administration guidance for industry foodeffect bioavailability and fed bioequivalence studies food and drug administration wwwfdagovcderguidancefnlhtm the reasons for this increased absorption have in part been previously discussed fats are emulsified by gallbladder secretions breaking it down into more easily absorbed particles in the small intestine and some types of fats take a different path into the human bloodstream than most other nutrients they bypass the portal vein that otherwise goes straight from the intestine to the liver for filtering before nutrients are generally allowed to reach the majority of the body instead the body reassembles certain fats and shuttles them to the lymphatic and circulatory systems where they enter the general bloodstream without passage through the liver many fats bypass the portal vein “freeway” to the liver whereas smaller fatty acids that are more water soluble do indeed go to the liver first as well in order to prepare cannabinoids for higher bioavailability the cannabinoid molecules can be manipulated in certain ways to connect them at a molecular level with various foods lexaria’s technology “shuttles” the cannabinoid molecules “within” other food molecules even unrelated to lipids foods that we select have certain characteristics that work synergistically with cannabinoids such as black tea then lipids such as sunflower oil and milk powder and others can be added due to their well known properties within the human gi system in the summer of  the us laboratory we commissioned performed some of the first tests ever known to be conducted on cannabidiol absorption into human intestinal cells the results were astonishing utilizing a mixture of hemp oil black tea and select lipids and processed with a patented technological method resulted in intestinal tissue cbd permeability  higher than cbd mixed with black tea and water and when that same mixture of hemp oil black tea and select lipids and processed with the patented technological method is compared to the absorption of cbd and water alone the absorption levels into the human intestinal cells rose to a  improvement this sort of vital scientific research adds to our cumulative understanding that cannabinoids can indeed be ingested with bioabsorption levels that approach or perhaps even surpass those achieved from smoking however much remains to be learned for example we do not know what ratio of cannabinoids might be delivered to the liver for filtration via the portal vein as compared to delivery straight to the lymphatic and circulatory systems for higher bioavailability and additional laboratory testing with different individual lipids will have to be undertaken to determine which might perform best live animal tests or even human testing may be required to learn more about how the newest forms of technology are able to manipulate cannabinoid molecules along with certain food molecules to deliver such dramatic changes in absorption once the processes are more thoroughly researched we will begin to have a more complete understanding of the most efficient ways to deliver cannabinoids to humans since all cannabinoid molecules are so closely related it is reasonable to believe that the processes that work for higher bioavailability rates in cbd will also work for thc and other cannabinoid molecules one potential outcome is that in pursuing more efficient delivery methods for any of these molecules it may be possible to lower overall dosages for all of them the benefits are obvious a person requiring mg of a substance in order to achieve a desired outcome would have to consume mg of that substance if the bioavailability is only  but raise the bioavailability rate to say  and consumption drops to just mg this is a massive reduction in intake with a lower risk of overdosage and leads to a potentially lighter workload on the liver accompanied by certain reductions in waste and consumer cost until recently smoking was the most effective way to ingest cannabinoids provided one was willing to overlook the unhealthy side effects and the social stigma this creates a deadly paradox “some cannabinoids are good for me but smoking is not” smoking is an increasingly unacceptable activity in large segments of society the death and misery toll from disease caused by smoking is unarguable there is a large segment of society which reasonably argues that the act of smoking marijuana impacts nonsmokers the moment a smoker impacts a nonsmoker either through odor or second hand smoke smoking is no longer a personal decision even though it may deliver beneficial molecules such as cannabidiol now because our understanding of bioavailability has increased and the new and exciting advances in technology it is possible to deliver comparable bioavailability as smoking but without the negative side effects it is actually possible that one day using disruptive absorption enhancing technologies foods will be reasonably able to replace smoking as the most effective delivery mechanism for cannabinoids a word of caution lab testing is not the same as human clinical trials or even animal testing unexpected things can happen as simplified in vitro tests are expanded into the complexity of living beings – meaning it is possible that the positive results achieved in vitro will not be reproduced in animals or humans it is just too early to know that for sure bioavailability matters… a lot improved bioavailability can lead to reduced social pressures associated with what are currently more common delivery methods such as smoking or vaping reducing smoking can lead to fewer societal objections for both cigarette and cannabis smoking positive community health outcomes are likely to be associated with lowered rates of smoking and higher bioavailability could be associated with lower overall dosages of certain molecules which can itself be associated with reduced stress on the liver and other organs as well as financial cost savings for consumers       foodproducts corppresentationsmedia education get hemp tea benefits  information on lexaria hemp cbd product  lexaria energy menu home food products food

species such as agricultural or industrial hemp echinacea cannabis sativa kale and other plants cbd is one of over  distinct compounds within hemp it is clear that cannabis and cbd are two entirely different things cannabidiol is a phytocannabinoid plant based it is not psychoactive and has antipsychotic effects due to decades of old laws throughout most of the western world banning the cultivation or use of marijuana clinical research into cbd and the human endocannabinoid regulatory system is not as advanced as might be expected in fact it might not be wrong to say that the endocannabinoid system has a leading role in one of the last great mysteries of how the human body works michelle reillo ph d and cofounder of vipovatm has written that “the human endocannabinoid system is responsible for memory networks in the brain both excitatory and inhibitory including the neurogenesis of hippocampal granule cells which regulate the timing of the endocannabinoids in accordance with the brain’s needs pain perception mood synaptic plasticity motor learning appetite and taste regulation and metabolic function which regulates the storage of energy and transport of cellular nutrition cb receptors are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as the lungs kidneys and liver cb receptors are predominantly expressed in the immune system and hematopoietic cells” there is a vast amount of research required to unlock the knowledge of precisely how cbd interacts with the endocannabinoid system and how these influence or affect human health but already early indications are astonishing to many observers documented research has implicated the endocannabinoid system andor cannabidiol to each of the following conditions alzheimer’s disease and dementia anxiety and depression appetite asthma cancer cardiovascular function digestion epilespsy fibromyalgia glaucoma headache and migraine huntington’s disease immune function inflammation irritable bowel disease liver disease memory metabolism and energy homeostasis multiple sclerosis nausea and vomiting neural development neuropathic pain or chronic pain osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis posttraumatic stress disorder parkinson’s disease psychiatric disease psychomotor behavior schizophrenia and psychosis spinal cord injury and disease stress and emotional state regulation tourette’s syndrome wakesleep cycles wasting syndrome in aids and cancer patients the list is so comprehensive it is staggering no claim has been made and no claim is being made that cbd “cures” any of these conditions or diseases however thousands of researches usually working independently of each other have discovered links or associations of some kind between cbd or the endocannabinoid system and each of these diseases or conditions it seems clear that with links or effects to such a widely varied group of conditions the endocannabinoid system plays a central role in human health even if that role is currently poorly understood perversely much of the research to date has been conducted on cannabis the plant not necessarily with regard to which of the  compounds within the cannabis might be responsible for noted outcomes the majority of such studies temper potential beneficial outcomes with remarks of the negative psychotropic effects that are often associated with tetrahydrocannabinol thc it is always important to remember that thc cannabis and cbd are distinctly different things as well the interrelationships between the hundreds of various molecules that together make up the cannabis plant are poorly understood and require much more research before science understands them more clearly much of the research conducted to date has been with animals or is laboratory research and is not based on human clinical studies preclinical animal studies may have predictive value but may not translate accurately from an animal species to humans in humans there is also always the possibility of placebo effect though that is not likely possible in animal studies lexaria’s patented technology formulates its products to infuse cbd within lipids in order to provide a potentially more comforting and bioavailable delivery to the human digestive system it will take the collective work and research of thousands of highly trained professionals to determine whether there are actually any health benefits associated with ingesting cbd and if so how best to optimize cbd delivery we do not know the answers today sources for this article information
