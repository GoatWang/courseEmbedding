quarter parkway’s board unanimously approved the agreement tpg capital and its affiliates which own about  percent of parkway’s outstanding common stock have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction parkway’s strong local presence “we believe there are still some nearterm headwinds in the office sector for houston but the implied asset valuation of this transaction shows cppib’s appreciation for the highquality portfolio we have assembled and the nearterm stability it provides during the current downturn in the market” james heistand parkway’s president  ceo said in a prepared statement parkway owns the largest office portfolio in houston totaling about  million square feet across  properties located in the westchase greenway and galleria submarkets the highquality office properties

infrastructure investment opportunity deloitte reits the new infrastructure investment opportunity according to a new report from deloitte reits could offer a potential avenue for infrastructure investment by the editors of commercial property executive  apr   apr comma  national news reits facebook twitter google linkedin email subscribe to cpe april   by allison landa news editor and barbra murray contributing editor courtesy flickr creative commons user orin zebest according to a new report from deloitte reits could offer a potential avenue for infrastructure investment “coming out of the economic downturn private investors are seeking new avenues to generate taxefficient returns on their invested funds” reads the report titled “reits and infrastructure projects the next investment frontier” it continues on to say that the infrastructure sector continues to attract private investor interest particularly as more governments look to publicprivate partnerships to provide funding from highways and public transportation to waste disposal and water supply to energy and modes of communication us infrastructure is in sore need of repair as well as expansion to accommodate the country’s mushrooming population while the federal government has allotted  billion through the american recovery and reinvestment act of  for highway and public transportation improvements alone as deloitte notes in the report the american society of civil engineers’  report card for american infrastructure estimates that  trillion is needed to sufficiently upgrade the system reits according to deloitte could pick up the financial slack for these projects it’s all about private capital and publicprivate partnerships “in recent years private investors have expressed interest in adding infrastructure assets to their investment portfolios” it asserts “in general private investments are often made via flowthrough investment vehicles such as limited liability corporations however recent internal revenue service private letter rulings may now allow investors to use reits as an alternative investment structure” according to deloitte the topic of private investments in infrastructure has grown amongst politicians and financial professionals with the use of a publicprivate partnership structure in use in countries including australia canada france and the united kingdom through these partnerships the public sector grants a privatesector party or consortium a longterm concession for responsibility for some or all of the design construction financing operations and maintenance of a publicly owned asset in the us however these partnerships are relatively new and at some points have created controversy that said deloitte notes that several highprofile transactions in the us have reported significant financial benefits “these successes combined with a growing need to spend trillions of dollars repairing and constructing roads and bridges airports and electric gas and water distribution systems as well as hospitals courthouses and prisons” the report reads “are causing supporters to believe that increased access to publicprivate partnerships would be a welcome complement to traditional infrastructure financing using taxexempt bonds” the report lists several advantages of reit investments in infrastructure transactions liquidity incremental scalability capital market access and taxation “in short reits offer certain advantages over partnerships in their ability to raise capital from diverse sources particularly foreign investors” the report notes “in addition expanding the investor base to individual investors may increase the availability of equity capital for infrastructure projects” while there are pluses to the infrastructure reit concept for publicprivate projects there are also a few drawbacks the majority of publicprivate partnership endeavors will produce sizeable tax losses in the initial  to  years of operation losses that would not pass through to reit shareholders additionally relying on a reit as an investment vehicle for infrastructure projects would also present income test barriers however deloitte points to a couple of feasible solutions to that obstacle one option would be new legislation creating infrastructure investment trusts that would allow for the classification of revenues from publicprivate partnership infrastructure participation–including rent from real property–as qualifying income thereby eliminating the test barriers another solution would be the incorporation of a new system that would permit infrastructure assets to be owned or leased by a taxable reit subsidiary without the existing restrictions on the total value of the reit related posts midsummer musings
