richardson i really appreciate the opportunity to be here today to reflect on over  years of administering two unique and challenging areas both  employee plans and exempt organizations  enrich the lives of millions of americans and play a vital role in our society  was a turbulent time for america for the first and only time in our history neither our president nor vice president had been elected to those offices long lines at the gas pumps finally eased as the oil embargo was lifted and patty hearst was kidnapped all you might remember from  is that hank aaron broke babe ruths home run record or that the miami dolphins won the super bowl for the second year in a row you may not remember the other events taking place that would change history that very year many american workers attempted to draw their pensions and discovered a horrible truth  the money was not there you also may not remember the studebaker car company studebaker had a good pension plan for its employees but fate was not kind to studebaker nor its employees when they tried to draw their pensions they were horrified to discover that there was nothing left for them but studebaker was not to blame it had not broken any laws unfortunately for the employees no laws were there to protect them people were shocked to hear about one employee who worked for ten straight years after a short break in service he worked another ten years but guess what his years working for the company did not satisfy its  year service requirement his service had to be consecutive and the employee got nothing so many stories like this forced congress to act on labor day the employee retirement income security act of  became law erisa as many of us refer to it imposed funding rules and vesting requirements on pension plans so that retired workers would get the benefits they earned some of you may remember that many people thought the acronym  erisa  really stood for every ridiculous idea since adam little did we know the prediction that erisa contained every ridiculous idea was a bit premature congress recognized that the job of protecting workers pensions was so big that it not only created a new agency the pension benefit guaranty corporation but vested dual responsibility for administering erisa with the irs and the labor department the job was so big that congress also created a separate irs organization headed by an assistant commissioner to oversee the administration of employee plans congress gave that assistant commissioner the added responsibility for exempt organizations now some of you may wonder why congress combined the responsibility for employee plans and exempt organizations at first blush these two areas dont seem to have much in common a closer look however reveals some method to this apparent madness while neither exempt organizations nor employee benefit plans are revenue raisers in the traditional sense what they contribute to the fabric of american life cannot be counted in dollars and cents just to give you some idea of their magnitude in  alone an estimated  billion of federal tax expenditures were related to employee plans and exempt organizations by   million workers participated in almost  private retirement plans with assets of  trillion when you add public plans of federal state and local governments pension assets total almost  trillion   percent of the combined value of the new york american and nasdaq stock exchanges the tax exempt organization numbers are just as impressive at the beginning of  over  million taxexempt organizations had combined assets exceeding  trillion total receipts including contributions reached  billion exempt organizations represent approximately  percent of the gross domestic product the unified supervision of employee plans and exempt organizations has assured that while not producing revenue per se both receive the highest priority at irs i dont want to bore you with the gory details of erisa although i know some of you erisa lawyers tom would like nothing better fortunately i dont need to go into details because i understand your packets include copies of a part of the law and its legislative history in administering erisa the sensitive challenges we at the irs face are the tension between enforcement of sanctions on a plan sponsor for code violations and the need to protect and preserve employees retirement benefits this tension exists because the party that violates the law is often the plan sponsor or employer but it is the workers depending on these plans to fund their retirements who suffer most when a plan is disqualified because of this tension practitioners including many of you have helped us develop creative solutions that foster both compliance with the code and protection of employee benefits for example our voluntary compliance resolution program  or vcr  encourages conscientious employers to monitor their plans and correct defects voluntarily since this program began in  over  plans have participated helping to protect the benefits of almost  million participants the vcr program reflects our servicewide commitment to find creative and less costly solutions to compliance issues other examples of alternative dispute resolution programs are the advanced pricing agreement program in the international area and the large case advanced issue resolution program the service along with the treasury department has an active guidance program in the employee plans area just since i became commissioner we have issued over  employee plan publications including  sets of regulations and  revenue rulings and procedures on its th anniversary i dont think it is too soon to declare erisa a success in  years the number of plan participants and beneficiaries has nearly doubled from  million to almost  million of those employees who are covered  percent have vested benefits as opposed to only  percent  years ago and the time periods required for vesting have been progressively shortened more good news  about  percent of employers have prototype plans these plans offer small businesses an inexpensive way to provide pension coverage for their workers i think its safe to say that erisas vision  to provide widelybased pension coverage  has become a reality while protection for employees retirement funds is relatively recent special treatment for charitable endeavors has a long and rich past history tells us that taxation and accompanying exemptions are old acquaintances the first modern income tax system introduced in england in  included an exemption for charitable organizations ninetytwo years later lord mnaghten wrote one of his famous opinions defining common law charitable purposes in an income tax refund suit commissioners v pemsel many of you may remember him better for mnaghtens rule something that is not an accepted defense in tax cases our own income tax laws going back even before the sixteenth amendment have their roots in this british system charitable exemptions included with the current push to reduce government spending private charity will play an increasingly critical role in ensuring our nations well being not unlike employee plans overseeing exempt organizations provides unique and significant challenges for example we must assure that the privilege of tax exemption goes to only qualified organizations all while trying to keep government involvement in these organizations to a minimum those of you who have heard me speak know by now that the irs is reinventing itself not left out of our reinvention efforts is our exempt organization function and the result is more good news thirty eight states have agreed to let the irs form  satisfy state financial reporting requirements this is a remarkable joint federal and state effort that has saved charities and other exempt organizations hundreds of millions of dollars in filing and return preparation costs this fedstate initiative is an example our servicewide efforts to work with the states to reduce filing burdens and serve our customers better in another effort to make things work better for all involved we are upgrading our exempt organization master file this upgrade will provide more timely information enhancing public and governmental understanding of tax exempt organizations we have only begun our modernization effort in the exempt organizations area our next effort is to make the electronic filing of exempt organization returns a reality we are also changing the way we issue determination letters currently determination letters are issued by our seven key districts today i want to announce that we have chosen cincinnati as the place to centralize our employee plans and exempt organizations determination letter program centralization will enable us to better ensure the quality and consistency of the determination letter program not only are doing what we can administratively to improve the system for everyone but along with our colleagues at treasury we are working for major law changes to improve tax administration for exempt organizations one example you may be familiar with is the socalled intermediate sanctions legislation at the present time in abusive situations the service is faced with the hobsons choice of ignoring violations of the law or revoking an organizations exemption the intermediate sanctions legislation if enacted would allow a wider array of options the tax world is a strange one because it is a world where the regulated generally cry out for more regulations not fewer in the current atmosphere of regulatory reform it is interesting to note that it is not typically the presence of regulations interpreting the tax laws that creates burden on taxpayers often it is their absence that does so exempt organizations are no exception to this rule from what i hear from those of you who work in this area exempt organizations if anything is an area where more is definitely better to increase exempt organization guidance jim mcgovern our assistant commissioner for employee plans and exempt organizations issued a challenge to celia roadys exempt organizations committee to work with him to identify areas where guidance is needed i would like to thank you and your committee celia for its impressive submission which is included in your packet with your continued support i anticipate that during  we will publish more exempt organization guidance the employee plans and exempt organizations area is and will continue to be a major crossroads for issues of tax administration and public policy and i suspect as in the past there will be no shortage of public controversy the journey over the last  years has been an eventful one there is no reason to believe that the next  years will be any less trying demanding or challenging i began this afternoon noting the historic events of  erisa addressed one of the most compelling issues of that time ensuring that workers had money when they retired events we are experiencing today are no less historic the last time i addressed this august body i challenged each of you to rise above being mere technical specialists and take on more of the characteristics of generalists capable of exercising sound judgment in the advice you offer your clients today i would like to issue you yet another challenge i encourage each of you to become engaged in the compelling issues of our time and think creatively about how we address these difficult issues after all what we are engaged in today may become another erisa that shapes the next twenty years thank you again for the opportunity to join you today and i hope you all enjoy your time here in los angeles previous  next
