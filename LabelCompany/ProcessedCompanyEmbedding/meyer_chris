first ones to say there is always more to learn often the best way to learn is to be a fly on the wall while watching a peer chris and trish meyer have given after effects users a unique and wonderful opportunity in after effects in production allowing us to look over the shoulders of some of the best motiongraphics designers in the business and watch and learn as they go through the creative process unlike the fly on the wall though we have the chance to occasionally put down the book and practice whats been learnedin the tutorials section the authors break down the process of creating broadcastquality motion graphics into a dozen stepbystep tutorials each tutorial focuses on or introduces a particular feature and often builds on features that were introduced in a previous tutorial the enclosed cdrom includes all  project and media files and the final rendered movies giving the reader the chance to build the project from scratch or carefully dissect a project thats already builtcase studies a far smaller section of the book but equal in value to the rest explores breaks down and dissects after effects projects that are on the air or on the web including work from such studios as belief attik and curious pictures while less stepbystep oriented one gets the chance to learn why each project was handled the way it was rather than howas an added bonus the cdrom includes numerous free plugins from such vendors as pinnacle media  boris trapcode and the foundry for both mac and windows versions of after effects theres also plenty of bonus material to read and sift through in the form of pdf filesadditional tutorials tips and tricks and project templatesafter effects in production is a musthave book for any user who intends to grow into a serious designer or for

magazine will be familiar with the columns from trish and chris meyer there is no question that they are about as knowledgeable about after effects as two people can be the only reason i give this book a lessthanstellar review is that it like the other two after effects books in this series is pretty badly writtenthis is a common failing for computer howto books in order to justify obscene pricing publishers pad the books with folksy commentary at best its condescending at worst it actually obscures the facts about the software that the reader is trying to learnthat said and taking into
