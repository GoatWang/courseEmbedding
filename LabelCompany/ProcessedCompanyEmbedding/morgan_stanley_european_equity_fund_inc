wisdomtree and currency hedging related links international investing what is currency hedging why hedge hedging strategies dynamic currency hedging strategy europe  international japan  korea what is currency hedging international investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors but these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations while currency can sometimes push equity returns higher it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty   currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange fx risk on international investments returns popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts spot contracts and foreign currency options   at wisdomtree we have been implementing currencyhedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more costeffective than many investors expect the bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets mechanics of the currency hedge here is how currency hedging typically works at wisdomtree   the wisdomtree currency hedged equity family of funds implements wisdomtree’s currencyhedging strategies by entering into onemonth forward contracts each month and rebalancing at monthend  ordinary brokerage commissions apply why hedge foreign currencies   investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency this risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth this “currency bet” as some might call it can help increase total returns during periods when the euro yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar but it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value we believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency when it comes to hedging foreign currencies there are several myths out there let’s take a look at some of the most common myth  it is expensive to hedge foreign currencies typically it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher shortterm interest rates than the united states as is the case in brazil for example however the euro yen and british pound—which combine to represent almost threequarters of the weight of the msci eafe index a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of  developed countries in europe australasia and japan —each has a very low cost to hedge as figure  shows in addition as us rates rise relative to rates in europe and japan dollarbased investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure put another way it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure   source wisdomtree bloomberg with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results myth  euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining us dollar the values of the euro and yen in essence do not make good hedges against us inflation rates or declining us dollar purchasing power what does make a potentially good hedge against inflation we believe that stocks representing claims on real assets andor those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation as figure  shows dividend growth on the sp  index and msci eafe index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—cpi in periods of high inflation while currency returns did not   myth  currency returns are a wash in the long run one of the arguments we hear often is that due to a concept called purchasing power parity ppp currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends interestingly international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends as shown in figures a and b and when the currency is down that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure   source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index     source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index strategic  tactical hedging   the strength of the us dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged and some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency additionally currency exposure can offer an added risk with little or no positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk” although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing it doesn’t have to be   for investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen currency hedging is an important option as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness strategic hedging for the long term when investing for the long term it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question in fact as figure  shows over the short and long term currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments and over the long term shown below hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the sp  tactical hedging for shortterm allocations currency can make a big difference—even in the short term in the abenomics period starting november   and ending september   the msci japan index returned —a decent return until it is compared to the wisdomtree japan hedged equity index which achieved a  return over the same timeframe the difference the wisdomtree index hedges the yen which lost  over the same period while the msci index does not   and there were similar results throughout europe where the wisdomtree europe hedged equity index returned  while the msci emu index lost  and the euro lost    why hedge dynamically   historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short and longterm holding periods while currency hedging has obvious advantages some investors may not want the challenge of timing us dollar strength or weakness building on our expertise in currency hedging wisdomtree pioneered dynamic currency hedging an adaptive strategy suited for longterm investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings   problem solving   many leave it to their active manager to make the hedgeno hedge decision but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection not currencies dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to time when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core longrun allocation  dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions   how is it achieved   wisdomtree partnered with record currency management a currency manager with over  years of experience to determine hedging signals for the new index family targeting profitable hedges the strategy targets mid to longterm excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses diversification by signal time horizon signals used to determine

opportune time to add them   of course we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the us dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats we may be on the cusp of a prolonged

stronger by one very important measure how much you are now being paid to hedge   an important element of currencyhedged strategies involves the use of forward contracts to neutralize currency exposure the pricing of these forward contracts is based on relative interest rate differentials in some countries like brazil shortterm interest rates are very high so it can cost us investors upward of  per year to hedge exposure to currencies like the brazilian real that creates an incredibly high hurdle for how much the currency has to decline before an investor breaks even on paying that hedge cost   but the actions the ecb took in december  make hedging the euro different the ecb took its deposit rate more negative—cutting rates to  basis points bps the us federal reserve fed hiked interest rates for the first time in nine years and now has a band on its shortterm rate of – bps the midpoint of the range would be  bps this means currency hedging is not only inexpensive—investors are actually getting paid to hedge the euro and ifwhen the fed increases rates in  that “payment” will increase further   historical cost of hedging the euro month currency forward implied rates as of  from a tactical perspective when we look at what factors can help improve the returns from a purely passive hedging standpoint interest rate differentials are the most powerful longrun signal given that an investor is starting to get paid more than  basis points a year from the differential in interest rates this offers a boost to returns to hedged strategies over unhedged strategies even if the euro does not move of course if the euro appreciates the hedged strategies will not participate in those gains but they will be hedged against further losses in the euro if those were to occur   wisdomtree has three exchangetraded fund etf options to target euroarea stocks with a currency hedge    wisdomtree europe hedged equity etf hedj provides access to the dividendpaying exporters of europe which can be positioned to benefit from a decline in the euro with their goods becoming more competitively priced in the global markets we believe these companies have not fully benefited from the fall in the euro yet as many of them also have large amounts of business coming from the emerging markets which have also been weak in the last year this is our flagship etf for euroareahedging strategies    wisdomtree europe hedged smallcap equity etf eusc provides access to smallcap companies of the euro area and offers exposure to a more local side of european stocks this fund can pair nicely with the largecap multinationals to diversify size exposure and geographic revenue mixes of the companies    wisdomtree dynamic currency hedged europe equity etf ddez provides access to a broad crosssection of dividend payers from the euro area and implies a dynamic currency hedge for investors who do not want to rotate between hedged and unhedged strategies but want to have some currency exposure when the environment is supportive of it this fund can adapt and provide that type of tactical hedging solution important risks related to this article there are risks associated with investing including possible loss of principal foreign investing involves special risks such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty these funds focus their investments in europe the impact of events and developments associated with the region can adversely affect performance the securities of smallcapitalization companies generally trade in lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than largercapitalization stocks or the stock market as a whole the funds use various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in the value of the euro against the us dollar and these strategies may not be successful  ddez invests in derivatives in seeking to obtain a dynamic currencyhedge exposure derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions the funds invest in the securities included in or representative of their indexes regardless of their investment merit and the funds do not attempt to outperform their indexes or take defensive positions in declining markets   due to the investment strategy of these funds they may make higher capital gain distributions than other etfs please read each fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding each fund’s risk profile  diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment loss   dividends are not guaranteed and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time      currency hedged equity dynamic currency hedging europe tweet share feedback previous post next post print page categories all articles etf

investment outlook the long cycle continues we expect the long postcrisis economic recovery to continue in  as a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to continue in

conditions  portfolio characteristics definitions priceearnings pe is the price of a stock divided by its earnings per share sometimes called the multiple pe gives investors an idea of how much they are paying for a company’s earning power the higher the pe the more investors are paying and therefore the more earnings growth they are expecting pricebook compares a stocks market value to the book value per share of total assets less total liabilities this number is used to judge whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued earnings per share eps growth is the weighted average of earnings per share growth for all securities in the portfolio projected for the past five fiscal years earnings per share for a company is defined as total earnings divided by shares outstanding weighted median market capitalization is the point at which half of the market value of a portfolio is invested in stocks with a greater market cap and consequently the other half is invested in stocks with a lower market cap ltm  last twelve months turnover is sourced from the funds current prospectus the index data displayed under allocations are calculated using msim and other thirdparty methodologies and may differ from data published by the vendor riskreturn definitions alpha is the excess return or value added positive or negative of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the markets upward or downward movements a beta greater than  identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market while a beta less than  identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market the beta of the market is always equal to  information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk as measured by tracking error versus the portfolio’s benchmark r squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index an r squared of  means the portfolio performance is  correlated to the index’s whereas a low rsquared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s sharpe ratio is a riskadjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation the sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk the higher the sharpe ratio the better the historical riskadjusted performance standard deviation measures how widely individual performance returns within a performance series are dispersed from the average or mean value tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark risk considerations there is no assurance that a mutual fund will achieve its investment objective funds are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the fund will decline and that the value of fund shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them accordingly you can lose money investing in this fund please be aware that this fund may be subject to certain additional risks in general equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic market and liquidity risks the risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance they also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks concentrated investments in europe are more susceptible to such risks affecting european issuers than a fund that holds more geographically diversified investments focused investing to the extent that the fund invests in a limited number of issuers the fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the funds overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the fund were invested more widely morningstar rankings the percentile rankings are based on the average annual total returns for the

morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star

wisdomtree and currency hedging related links international investing what is currency hedging why hedge hedging strategies dynamic currency hedging strategy europe  international japan  korea what is currency hedging international investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors but these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations while currency can sometimes push equity returns higher it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty   currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange fx risk on international investments returns popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts spot contracts and foreign currency options   at wisdomtree we have been implementing currencyhedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more costeffective than many investors expect the bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets mechanics of the currency hedge here is how currency hedging typically works at wisdomtree   the wisdomtree currency hedged equity family of funds implements wisdomtree’s currencyhedging strategies by entering into onemonth forward contracts each month and rebalancing at monthend  ordinary brokerage commissions apply why hedge foreign currencies   investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency this risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth this “currency bet” as some might call it can help increase total returns during periods when the euro yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar but it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value we believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency when it comes to hedging foreign currencies there are several myths out there let’s take a look at some of the most common myth  it is expensive to hedge foreign currencies typically it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher shortterm interest rates than the united states as is the case in brazil for example however the euro yen and british pound—which combine to represent almost threequarters of the weight of the msci eafe index a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of  developed countries in europe australasia and japan —each has a very low cost to hedge as figure  shows in addition as us rates rise relative to rates in europe and japan dollarbased investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure put another way it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure   source wisdomtree bloomberg with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results myth  euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining us dollar the values of the euro and yen in essence do not make good hedges against us inflation rates or declining us dollar purchasing power what does make a potentially good hedge against inflation we believe that stocks representing claims on real assets andor those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation as figure  shows dividend growth on the sp  index and msci eafe index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—cpi in periods of high inflation while currency returns did not   myth  currency returns are a wash in the long run one of the arguments we hear often is that due to a concept called purchasing power parity ppp currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends interestingly international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends as shown in figures a and b and when the currency is down that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure   source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index     source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index strategic  tactical hedging   the strength of the us dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged and some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency additionally currency exposure can offer an added risk with little or no positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk” although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing it doesn’t have to be   for investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen currency hedging is an important option as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness strategic hedging for the long term when investing for the long term it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question in fact as figure  shows over the short and long term currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments and over the long term shown below hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the sp  tactical hedging for shortterm allocations currency can make a big difference—even in the short term in the abenomics period starting november   and ending september   the msci japan index returned —a decent return until it is compared to the wisdomtree japan hedged equity index which achieved a  return over the same timeframe the difference the wisdomtree index hedges the yen which lost  over the same period while the msci index does not   and there were similar results throughout europe where the wisdomtree europe hedged equity index returned  while the msci emu index lost  and the euro lost    why hedge dynamically   historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short and longterm holding periods while currency hedging has obvious advantages some investors may not want the challenge of timing us dollar strength or weakness building on our expertise in currency hedging wisdomtree pioneered dynamic currency hedging an adaptive strategy suited for longterm investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings   problem solving   many leave it to their active manager to make the hedgeno hedge decision but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection not currencies dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to time when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core longrun allocation  dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions   how is it achieved   wisdomtree partnered with record currency management a currency manager with over  years of experience to determine hedging signals for the new index family targeting profitable hedges the strategy targets mid to longterm excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses diversification by signal time horizon signals used to determine

opportune time to add them   of course we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the us dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar and if the dollar is rising other currencies are often weakening hedging them can help to reduce volatility europe hedged equity family   the european central bank’s recent

currency hedged equity getting paid to hedge  jeremy schwartz  director of research tweet share feedback last year one of the most important investment themes was currency hedging particularly for eurodenominated stocks many investors believed the euro was going to weaken on the back of quantitative easing by the european central bank ecb—and that’s exactly what happened versus the us dollar the euro started  at  and closed the year at  with such a big move many investors are wondering if they missed the boat from our perspective to the contrary the case to hedge the euro has gotten stronger by one very important measure how much you are now being paid to hedge   an important element of currencyhedged strategies involves the use of forward contracts to neutralize currency exposure the pricing of these forward contracts is based on relative interest rate differentials in some countries like brazil shortterm interest rates are very high so it can cost us investors upward of  per year to hedge exposure to currencies like the brazilian real that creates an incredibly high hurdle for how much the currency has to decline before an investor breaks even on paying that hedge cost   but the actions the ecb took in december  make hedging the euro different the ecb took its deposit rate more negative—cutting rates to  basis points bps the us federal reserve fed hiked interest rates for the first time in nine years and now has a band on its shortterm rate of – bps the midpoint of the range would be  bps this means currency hedging is not only inexpensive—investors are actually getting paid to hedge the euro and ifwhen the fed increases rates in  that “payment” will increase further   historical cost of hedging the euro month currency forward implied rates as of  from a tactical perspective when we look at what factors can help improve the returns from a purely passive hedging standpoint interest rate differentials are the most powerful longrun signal given that an investor is starting to get paid more than  basis points a year from the differential in interest rates this offers a boost to returns to hedged strategies over unhedged strategies even if the euro does not move of course if the euro appreciates the hedged strategies will not participate in those gains but they will be hedged against further losses in the euro if those were to occur   wisdomtree has three exchangetraded fund etf options to target euroarea stocks with a currency hedge    wisdomtree europe hedged equity etf hedj provides access to the dividendpaying exporters of europe which can be positioned to benefit from a decline in the euro with their goods becoming more competitively priced in the global markets we believe these companies have not fully benefited from the fall in the euro yet as many of them also have large amounts of business coming from the emerging markets which have also been weak in the last year this is our flagship etf for euroareahedging strategies    wisdomtree europe hedged smallcap equity etf eusc provides access to smallcap companies of the euro area and offers exposure to a more local side of european stocks this fund can pair nicely with the largecap multinationals to diversify size exposure and geographic revenue mixes of the companies    wisdomtree dynamic currency hedged europe equity etf ddez provides access to a broad crosssection of dividend payers from the euro area and implies a dynamic currency hedge for investors who do not want to rotate between hedged and unhedged strategies but want to have some currency exposure when the environment is supportive of it this fund can adapt and provide that type of tactical hedging solution important risks related to this article there are risks associated with investing including possible loss of principal foreign investing involves special risks such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty these funds focus their investments in europe the impact of events and developments associated with the region can adversely affect performance the securities of smallcapitalization companies generally trade in lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than largercapitalization stocks or the stock market as a whole the funds use various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in the value of the euro against the us dollar and these strategies may not be successful  ddez invests in derivatives in seeking to obtain a dynamic currencyhedge exposure derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions the funds invest in the securities included in or representative of their indexes regardless of their investment merit and the funds do not attempt to outperform their indexes or take defensive positions in declining markets   due to the investment strategy of these funds they may make higher capital gain distributions than other etfs please read each fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding each fund’s risk profile  diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment loss   dividends are not guaranteed and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time      currency hedged equity dynamic currency hedging europe tweet share feedback previous post next post print page categories all articles etf
