grubhubs ceo matthew m maloney  chief executive officer thank you for joining our q earnings call i will begin with some highlights from the quarter and then give an update on our progress towards our top  strategic priorities after that i will turn the call over to adam who will give us some more detailed look at the numbers and forward guidance we continued our strong growth trajectory across the country in q generating record revenues and profits while aggressively expanding our delivery footprint we generated  million of net revenue for the seasonally strong first quarter up  from the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda was  million for the first quarter including our continued investment in delivery we ended the quarter with nearly  million active diners and generated food sales of  million for our local restaurant partners  and  increases from the prior year respectively this was despite exceptionally warm weather for all three months of the first quarter and a very difficult weather comp from the prior year in q we averaged over  orders per day and our diners ordered over  million times thats  million more orders than the first quarter of last year on our last call we reviewed the milestones we achieved in  and how excited we were about our momentum as we entered this year we highlighted the progress wed made across many key growth drivers for our business including delivery chain partnerships a renewed focus on product iteration and the roll out of the updated grubhub brand in short weve made great strides across all of these initiatives even though  is barely four months old we also began to see a positive impact to growth from these initiatives as we exited march and weve seen order growth accelerate in april from q levels these dynamics give us increased confidence in the reacceleration of order growth we implied in our guidance last quarter and updated today q was another strong quarter for grubhub delivery excluding labite we are now delivering more than  million annual gross food sales on a run rate basis a significant step up from q this is impressive growth but even more so in the context of our improved efficiency and decreased investment level as compared to the prior quarter we are seeing material economies of scale with our logistics network including decreasing incremental cost per delivery and reduced delivery times we still see diners who placed their first order through restaurants we deliver for exhibiting improved retention and increased ordering frequency versus those who dont we are hitting our target service levels in major metros including keeping delivery times near  minutes in many cities even with our significant increase in scale investment in delivery was down to just  million for the quarter we are currently operating delivery on a cash neutral basis in some high demand residential neighborhoods meaning that from a cash generation perspective we earn different between orders that we deliver versus orders restaurants deliver for themselves however grubhub delivery provides a significantly better experience for our diners through its more consistent and better service as well as a much broader selection of restaurants were very pleased with this growth and well continue to step on the accelerator including acquisitions of key delivery players like the one announced this morning these will help augment our scale and service abilities our new partner labite is one of the largest independent restaurant delivery services in the country with a strong presence in the greater los angeles area they have significant scale with diners restaurants gross food sales and drivers we believe that with the addition of labite to our portfolio we are the leading online food service provider in the los angeles area by a very significant margin we hope to leverage their knowledge and experience to further expand our lead in this huge market and adam will follow up with more details in the company later our delivery initiative goes handinhand with another strategic priority expanding our team partnerships following up on our success last quarter we added several new high profile partners in the first quarter including johnny rockets boston market uno pizzeria  grill and on the border this adds to our already strong lineup of national and regional chain partners and were just getting started these partners are excited about the incremental growth we drive with our network of nearly  million diners our key technology focusing only on connecting restaurants and diners and our driver logistics expertise while delivery and our chain initiative are improving the quality and selection for our restaurant network were driving diner engagement with a renewed focus on product innovation and the grubhub brand update as discussed we spent much of the last two years building and transitioning both brands grubhub and seamless on to a single nimble scalable technology platform with the technical debt largely behind us weve been able to focus on increasing conversion and driving frequency by improving the diner facing platforms let me highlight one of the more meaningful successes weve already had with our improved technology we are better able to address friction points from search all the way through checkout improved add to bag functionalities streamlined diner onboarding and payment processes as well as cutting page load times have all resulted in measurable conversion increases as weve rolled these improvements out to our diner network in late q and early q this means that our apps and site are easier to use diners are more likely to complete a purchase once they land on any of our properties this increases our ability to drive high quality traffic through marketing and converted to new diners which over the longterm should drive growth and generate more profit our product innovation roadmap is very strong and we will continue to focus on improving the conversion of new and returned diners personalization and the ease of use to drive more orders one of our primary goals going forward is to ensure that we surface the local favorite dishes and restaurants that our diners love in more engaging ways we made some great improvements so far and im excited about what we have in the pipeline as this year moves on on our last call we mentioned the new grubhub brand that started rolling out our new creative gives grubhub a bold new look designed to highlight the connection between restaurants and diners focusing on the amazing food that diners enjoy every day from their local favorite restaurants from eyecatching outofhome ads to updates through our web apps and apple tv platforms the rebrand is now in full force the initial results are positive weve seen a great response from diners on social media and a boost in brand awareness and ad recall we also feel that the new position allows us to more easily recruit key premium restaurants onto our platform and broaden our appeal to diners in every neighborhood truly becoming the platform of choice for ordering food across the country thanks to the elevated brand and a fresh emphasis on moving eating forward were thinking more broadly about how we can engage with diners one example from this quarter is our recently created emoji keyboard called mmmoji another is our decision to stop distributing plastic takeout bags in order to help generate awareness around earth day and environmental consequences we are also pursuing partnerships in line with our ongoing efforts to be relevant to diners in all the moments that matter whether at home or onthego we recently launched a pilot program with three hyattcentric hotels to deliver food from top local hotspots to the hyattcentric brands new restaurants onthego program satisfying guests who prefer to stay in rather than go out while traveling additionally through a partnership with hbo grubhub curated a selection of restaurant choices so that diners could pair tastes and flavors with five hbo viewing favorites we continue to execute very aggressively in our space as the opportunity is still tremendous and no one comes close to us at connecting diners with their local favorite restaurants were very excited about what the rest of  holds and i look forward to updating you on more of our progress next quarter with that i will hand it over to adam wholl walk you through the financials adam j dewitt  chief financial officer thanks matt ill start with our first quarter performance provide some forwardlooking color and then well open the call up to questions first quarter seasonally one of our strongest was a record quarter for us we achieved records across all of our key metrics revenue and profitability despite significant headwinds from the extremely mild winter on the east coast and chicago we ended the first quarter with active diners reaching  million a  yearoveryear increase we processed  daily average grubs and  million in gross food sales during the first quarter  and  yearoveryear increases respectively the acquisitions we completed in the first quarter and fourth quarters of last year contributed roughly  percentage point to yearoveryear order growth and  percentage points to yearoveryear growth in gross food sales first quarter revenues were  million  higher than the yearago quarter of  million if we exclude the acquisitions revenue growth would have been approximately  we achieved these records and hit the high end of our guidance for the first quarter even with the negative impact from weather while our guidance for the first quarter reflected the weather through january it ended up being a significant headwind for the remainder of the quarter to help quantify the impact we believe weather was approximately a basispoint headwind to yearoveryear order growth for the quarter and a little more than  million in revenue net revenue as a percentage of gross food sales was  during the first quarter this compares to  during the first quarter of last year the higher revenue capture rate is driven by the growth in our delivery efforts including the restaurant delivery service acquisitions that we have made to date capture rates excluding the delivery portion of our business were consistent with the fourth quarter as i noted yearoveryear gross food sales growth outpaced order growth  to this variance is driven in small part by an extra day in february and mostly by a  increase in average order size from  to  approximately twothirds of the increase in average order size is organic growth that weve seen year after year the remainder is driven by the acquisitions of diningin and restaurants on the run that closed midquarter last year and delivered dish which closed late in the fourth quarter on the expense side total sales and marketing expenses were  million this quarter a  increase compared to the same quarter last year and a sequential increase of  as compared to fourth quarter as a reminder last quarter we said that for  we would be focusing more on quality diners and increasing our advertising but at a lower rate than we have in the past our first quarter spend level is consistent with this goal weve also been communicating that as a result of our marketing strategy to target more quality diners we expect overall diner growth to more closely match order growth and diner frequency to decline less we saw both of these dynamics in the first quarter as active diners grew  on a yearoveryear basis and day orders per ending active diner declined  compared to first quarter of  a slowest decline since weve been public we expect diner frequency to continue to stabilize throughout this year as an aside here i wanted to note that the best way to look at the growth in active diners is on a yearoveryear basis there is a fair amount of noise in this metric quartertoquarter as we have seen over time so there can be some volatility when constructing a net diner adds metric on a sequential basis for example in the first quarter to support our rebranded grubhub we spent more of our advertising dollars at the end of the quarter including a fair amount of brandrelated nondirect response advertising that takes more time to have an impact in addition during the first quarter the weather that impacted our order volume also impacted our new diner growth as a result this year we will most likely add more net diners in the second quarter than we did in the first while last year as is more typical it was the opposite regardless of the timing our growth in diners was right in line with our internal expectations and we are confident it will support the accelerated growth we have implied in our guidance for the remainder of  operations and support expenses in q were  million a  increase compared to  million in the first quarter of last year and sequential increase of  as compared to the fourth quarter this increase is from our aggressive scaling of grubhub delivery the inclusion of delivery costs from the three acquisitions we concluded last year and the organic growth in overall orders in the first quarter our delivery investment or the amount we spent to pay for delivery in excess of the incremental revenue we received for delivery orders declined to approximately  million compared to the more than  million in the fourth quarter this decline came despite a significant increase in volume to a run rate of approximately  million in gross food sales annually demonstrating operating leverage we are achieving as we scale we expect a similar level investment in q as we continue to roll out new markets and grow in existing markets while continuing to expect the investment for the full year to be between  million and  million technology expenses excluding amortization of web development were  million for the quarter increasing  from the first quarter of  and  from the fourth quarter this increase is consistent with the investment weve been making in our technology and product teams which has helped to drive the improvements matt talked about earlier depreciation and amortization was  million for the quarter a sequential increase of  from the fourth quarter this was driven by a number of items including a full quarter of amortization of delivered dish intangibles software development capitalization and the accelerated planned retirement of some acquired software ga costs were  million a sequential increase of  from the  million in the fourth quarter this increase is coming primarily from  million in accelerated stock comp associated with some terminations in our acquired businesses and deal costs associated with the labite acquisition adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million an increase of  from  million in the same quarter the prior year adjusted ebitda margin was  this quarter an improvement of  basis points from the fourth quarter partially driven by the improved efficiency on the delivery side even with our aggressive delivery growth net income was  million compared to the prior year of  million net income per fully diluted common share was  on approximately  million weighted average fully diluted shares our tax rate for the first quarter was a little less than  and we expect approximately this rate for the rest of the year nongaap net income was  million or  per fully diluted common share compared to the prior year of  million or  per fully diluted common share nongaap net income excludes amortization of acquired intangibles acquisition and restructuring costs and stock based compensation expense as well as the income tax effects of these nongaap adjustments as matt noted this morning we announced our acquisition of labite a growing and profitable restaurant delivery service focused primarily in los angeles with a smaller presence in austin and the bay area that generated  million in gross food sales last year the deal will be approximately  million all cash and we expect it to close shortly we will update guidance more formally when we close but we expect labite to generate roughly  million in monthly revenue and a little less than  of monthly ebitda for the remainder of the year even with the acquisition of labite our cash flow and strong balance sheet give us a lot of flexibility to give us even more flexibility in pursuing acquisition opportunities we are announcing a closing of a new credit facility which took place last week this facility gives us a  million of immediate capacity and potentially another  million if we needed in addition we repurchased approximately  million shares under our recently authorized buyback in the first quarter we will continue to exercise our buyback opportunistically based on a combination of factors including the value of our stock and other potential opportunities to use our cash finally i want to share some thoughts on second quarter and full year guidance we currently expect between  million and  million of revenue for the second quarter and adjusted ebitda between  million and  million as you may recall we typically see a sequential decline from the first quarter to the second quarter last year for example we saw an approximately  decline in organic dags between those two quarters however given the positive impact of the initiatives matt discussed earlier the robust new diner trends weve seen in march and april and a strong order growth thus far in q we are expecting only a small sequential decline in organic dags for the coming quarter in addition as implied by our guidance we expect to see yearoveryear dag growth higher in the second quarter than the first quarter even after normalizing for the first quarter weather impact we typically dont give interquarter updates on performance but we thought it would be helpful to highlight the strength we saw in april to help explain the growth acceleration in the guidance for the full year we are bringing up the low end of the range for revenue by  million and now expect revenue to be between  million to  million we continue to expect adjusted ebitda to be between  million and  million implied in this guidance is our expectation that well able to maintain a higher level of dag growth for the remainder of the year we do expect to see normal seasonality in both revenue and ebitda in the back half of the year with both metrics bottoming in q before increasing in q but overall we expect dag growth for  to be higher than it was in the first quarter with that matt and i will take your questions operator please open the lines for questions questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from aaron kessler with raymond james your line is open aaron m kessler  raymond james  associates inc yes great thanks guys first question is if you can provide us maybe a cohort update kind of largest cities kind of versus tiertwo cities like you usually give and second matt for some of the initiatives you talked about that are driving some of the improved performance within the app and the site can you rank those maybe just whats having the biggest impact on those growth rates thank you adam j dewitt  chief financial officer yeah so aaron ill take the cohort question i think and matt will talk about the initiatives so the cohorts look very stable across both the tierones and the tiertwos obviously we had the weather impact that we talked about in the first quarter in general that dragged on order frequency but when we saw – weve been talking about the improvement that we saw at the end of the quarter and specifically in april and we saw the improvements across all the cohorts from old and new as well as tierone and tiertwo markets so it is pretty much the same story that weve had in all the quarters which is very stable cohorts and order frequency matthew m maloney  chief executive officer and aaron there is not a clearcut answer to what youre asking whats the prioritized impact of multiple product improvements over a quarter i can talk a little bit more about where the teams are focusing were really looking into – like the transaction funnel weve invested a lot in optimization in ab testing and making sure that were evaluating multiple changes at the same time across web platforms mobile web native app wherever people are placing orders and so were really looking at what can drive the highest conversion rate once somebody lands on the properties were also looking a lot at content and how can we augment and increase the content available how can we collect it from our restaurants and display it intelligently in a way that drives order we spent a lot of time on recommendations increasing relevancy in investing and reviews if youre placing orders you will notice that very frequently we send sms reviews and we have a high return of those and those are feeding directly into our recommendation system and so i think its something like we get a new – every restaurant on the platform gets a new review about every  hours or so so we have a very high velocity of engagement with our diners and thats all channeling into being able to better tell you what the best dishes what the best restaurants are in every neighborhood that we cover all the way across the country and then finally like i mentioned in the notes we spend a lot of time on page load how can we reduce page load time to make sure that its a very snappy experience and that we are right there with the menus when youre hungry aaron m kessler  raymond james  associates inc great thank you operator your next question comes from heath terry with goldman sachs your line is open heath terry  goldman sachs  co great just curious if you can give us a sense given customer growth what youre seeing in the trends and customer acquisition costs particularly as we at least see the perception of some of the venture backed competitors in the space maybe getting a little less aggressive whether or not youre seeing that show up in the efficiency of your marketing or your activity from a customer basis adam j dewitt  chief financial officer yeah how are you doing heath so what i say is in the past weve talked about the customer acquisition costs on the margin being pretty stable and i think when you dive really deep into it and you look at the different channels were seeing it very similar so were not seeing big fluctuations in anything like the rates that were buying sem words or display ads for us particularly if you try to imply a cost per acquisition you see a little bit of a higher one in the first quarter but i think as i talked about in my prepared remarks its more optics we did spend a lot on branding which doesnt have an immediate payoff and there were a lot of weather headwinds but were not seeing any dramatic fluctuations in markets from competition and in fact weve talked already a little bit about the strength in april and it was just as much on the new diner side as it was on the order side heath terry  goldman sachs  co great thanks operator your next question comes from mark may with citi your line is open mark a may  citigroup global markets inc broker hey thanks for taking my questions i wonder if you could comment on what impact that youve seen both at the time of initial launch and then as theyve been in the market for a while from the launch of say amazon prime now restaurant delivery andor ubereats in some of the markets that theyve launched and that you operate in where you overlap and then secondly you provided some color on why the diner growth decelerated in q and comment about how april is going but relative to your marketing spend marketing spend came down but relative to the diner growth obviously it was still relatively high just trying to understand what drove again the diner growth deceleration and why there is a little bit of a disconnect there because you back into a pretty high cost of new diner acquisition in q because of that and then lastly just a housekeeping question for labites im backing into roughly a  take rate is that roughly correct and maybe if you can help us think about how incorporating labites into the model may impact take rate thanks matthew m maloney  chief executive officer sure mark ill answer the first one and adam will take the rest of them so uber and amazon are the new boogiemen in the market i think last year there was more concern around venturebacked startups that ended up not being quite as competitive as people were worried they would be and now were looking at these companies and theyre great companies but i want to take a step back and really understand the marketplace dynamics we focus on bringing the best selection in every market and thats not just restaurants we deliver for but thats also restaurants that do their own delivery and its also pickup we try to address the market needs the demands of diners the best way we possibly can and were significantly further along than anyone else in that space we also believe that having the lowest fees is critical that diners actually care about transactional cost and that they will always migrate to the lowest cost opportunity if given that choice and then finally we believe in exceptional support so making sure that were there at the transaction if anything happens for the diner or for the restaurant wherever we need to be we want to be there to be supporting our transactions and if you execute on those three strategies you will win there really is no logistical advantage as people are concerned about and if you think about it logically the majority of the wait time for delivery is food preparation which no thirdparty can impact and then this second largest bucket is physically delivering the food from point a to point b and unless someone invents flying bicycles i dont think that is going to be dramatically reduced in the near future and so really when youre thinking about logistical advantage as long as youre using contemporary software gps alerts geofencing auto dispatch aggressive algorithms youre pretty much either – the most you can impact is about five minutes and thats food after being prepared before its picked up by your driver and i can tell you that a lot of this investment that we keep talking about quarterafterquarter is making sure that grubhub food does not sit on the counter waiting for a grubhub driver we want to make sure the driver is there before the food is ready and so if you add it all up there is no logical way for anyone to say i have x your drivers on the road so im going to have food there faster and so if you think about it its all about executing giving the diners what they want when they want it making sure you can send incredible demand for restaurants and thats whats going to win now to your specific question we talk to restaurants every day we have a lot of friends in a lot of markets and the community is saying that there just arent that many orders flowing through these competitive systems that everyone is concerned about we clearly dont see it impacting our value or our growth rate and so were going to continue executing as best we can and not pay attention to the noise because in spite of all of it and in spite of all the new competition were seeing some of the strongest trends in our order growth that weve seen in the past year adam j dewitt  chief financial officer mark this is adam ill talk a little bit about the cpi i tried to give a little color during the last question so i think theres a number of things at play one you have to remember that our diner number is not a gross diner number its an active diner which we think is the best metric best reflection of whats driving orders in the business at that time so its not a gross add number i think two theres a lot of volatility in the number quartertoquarter depending on whats happening this quarter there was volatility around the rebrand spend which we biased towards the end of the quarter and also was a lot of what i call nondirect response and so more branding more out of home more billboards more train stations less on sem and promotions and as a result its got a little bit of a lagged impact i think the biggest factor though in this quarter is really the weather in addition to orders weather has just as significant if not more significant impact on new diner growth and the headwind that we saw on the order side certainly played into the change in the active diner number i do want to point out that we do expect a bigger sequential increase in the second quarter than we saw in the first quarter even though its typically a slower quarter and then to your third question on labites i think you are close i think you should take that gross food sales number and you have the revenue number when we close we will publish we will update our guidance but in terms of the take rate i think you are close the labite model is very similar to the diningin and restaurants on the run models as well so its obviously a significantly higher take rate but the volumes fairly small relative to grubhub overall mark a may  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks guys operator your next question comes from ron josey with jmp securities your line is open ron victor josey  jmp securities llc great thanks for taking the question with delivery now in  markets just wondering how has the algorithm evolved in terms of matching driver supply and consumer demand call it the last  months i think matt you just talked about shaving five minutes off delivery time have you achieved that and then also i think you said decreasing incremental cost per delivery reduced delivery time and also cashneutral delivery in number of markets can you just talk about how well staffed you are from a driver perspective i think thats where a lot of the investments are heading this year and then also how youre generating consumer demand for delivery thank you matthew m maloney  chief executive officer sure ron so the algorithms evolved definitely over the past year weve hired a bunch of outstanding data scientists that do a lot of work both live and in lab simulations and like i said the majority of the delivery itself is taken up by actual work product and preparing food and moving food but there is a lot you can do around deadhead legs and making sure that the drivers are as fully utilized as possible when theyre driving from one place to another and thats really where you see the value of algorithmic innovation is in the cost savings part and so weve definitely seen a decreasing incremental cost of delivery as we increase network utilization we see it every month we pay a lot of attention to it with decreasing delivery times i think what youre seeing is a reduction of volatility around pickup as youre starting out with not a lot of volume in your network i think there are times when the food sits around or perhaps the communication with the restaurant isnt as tight as it needs to be i think over the past  year especially now that were at closer to  million in gross food sales on a run rate basis theres not a lot of room for lose communications and so weve tightened everything up were very much hardened and we have thousands of drivers in the market at any given time and thats increasing very aggressively as you point out a lot of the investment is to build up the infrastructure around recruiting training management and making sure that we have the platform that drivers want to drive on ron victor josey  jmp securities llc and on the demand side for consumers just normal change of events in terms of your brand marketing and things like that just to make sure consumers know you have delivery matthew m maloney  chief executive officer yes right now what were focusing on is having ubiquitous selection so if you want outstanding premium highquality bestofbreed food its there if you want pizzas and wings its there if you want chain foods we got it if you want the independents we got it and so the new brand reposition is really about highlighting the restaurants highlighting the incredible food thats available to you and really motivating hunger so that we can then fulfill it and so we dont highlight right now which restaurants are grubhub delivery versus which arent and were still working through how were going to highlight either just the best restaurants or just the restaurants we deliver for or some clear expectations around delivery time but right now theyre just in the mix on the grubhub platform and they participate in a significant demand that we generate natively ron victor josey  jmp securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from dean prissman with morgan stanley your line is open dean j prissman  morgan stanley  co llc thanks for taking my question you guys have added a meaningful amount of new restaurant supply for your inhouse delivery business can you discuss the level of productivity you are seeing with the supply versus your delivery  restaurant supply thanks matthew m maloney  chief executive officer yes so hey dean how are you so as we had talked about before i think one of the advantages – or the key advantage for us doing delivery is that we can add restaurants that we couldnt add to the platform before and so as were going to markets and adding delivery and selling restaurants were able to pick the best highestquality restaurants the most popular restaurants that we are able to identify and prioritize based on what people are searching for on grubhub and seamless what they are searching for on all menus and menu pages et cetera and so we are adding what we view is really highquality restaurants and so as a result of just the restaurants being highquality and also us being able to deliver a consistent service level on the delivery side were seeing the what ill call diner retention and diner frequency metrics for the restaurants that were adding on the delivery side to be pretty much universally better than the average restaurant at grubhub and so we continue to see that over the time and we think that that will have an impact overall as that base of restaurants continues to grow dean j prissman  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks for the color operator your next question comes from james cakmak with monness crespi hardt your line is open james cakmak  monness crespi hardt  co inc hi thanks with the focus on higher value diners we are seeing the declines in the frequency of ordering improve as we progress through the year do you think that it could potentially reach a positive territory at least by yearend and then looking at your credit facility  million and the acquisitions that youre making can you talk about how you think about the acquisitions that you make at least in terms of valuation and what it adds and can we just assume the balance that you have is going to be continued dry powder for deliveryrelated acquisitions thanks matthew m maloney  chief executive officer so in terms of the frequency decline i think what i said in the prepared remarks was that we continue to see improvement in that metric throughout the year whether or not it gets to zero im probably not prepared to say but we do expect to see continued improvement in that metric and its just part of our general strategy of focusing on the high valueadd diners its obviously still going to be offset by the mix shift away from corporate and new york which weve had for a couple of years now and thatll continue but i would think its going to be offset by the addition of and the focus on the higher quality diners in terms of the credit facility and the acquisitions when we think about acquisitions we think about a lot of things but primarily were looking for things that add to our diner network our restaurant network and our driver network and we think about valuing the acquisition in a lot of different ways it depends on the company that were looking at we also look at on a smaller basis potentially some technology addons that could either put us in a position to better service our restaurants or better service our diners but when you think about your question specifically was around valuation i think were thinking about whats it going to add or whats it going to bring to grubhub shareholders over the next several years right and so how are we going to turn the asset into something thats generating cash or more cash than it was generating by itself and then quantifying how much value its going to bring to the platform operator your next question comes from michael graham with canaccord your line is open michael graham  canaccord genuity inc hey guys thank you just a couple first thanks for quantifying the weather impact on revenue is it possible to quantify the impact on diners is the first one and then on the acquisition can you just talk a little bit about two things one is the pipeline of future deals do you have a lot of them planned in terms of delivery im just wondering you mentioned that the diner for labites and the restaurants for labites were also important assets in addition to the delivery functionality can you talk about how if at all youre planning to integrate those parties on to the grubhub platform are you going to run it as a separate local business in la and just maybe how youre thinking about that thank you adam j dewitt  chief financial officer hey mike ill take the weather question and matt will give you a little bit more color on the deals and how we think about them but in terms of the diner and the weather its really a tough number to back into what id say is it was material its certainly in the tens of thousands was it several hundred thousand probably not but it was a material number of new diners just based on the weather what we do see is when we look at our orders on a daily basis and we look at the new diners we see even more dramatic fluctuations in the new diner comps yearoveryear than we do in the orders yearoveryear so hopefully that helps give you a little bit of context matthew m maloney  chief executive officer and then mike in terms of labite and deals more broadly we dont have a pipeline of deals that were looking at i think were very open and opportunistic for whats out there however through our diningin and restaurants on the run delivered dish and now labite i think weve pretty much picked off the largest restaurant delivery networks in the country and there is a few more out there but these are really the big ones and it really goes to our almost cookie cutter strategy of building delivery these are significant and valuable assets that are being underutilized and with their current logistical infrastructure and the ability to drop them on our platform well be able to pull higher returns out of the same assets and thats the way we look at it so diningin is nearly fully integrated on the platform delivered dish which until now was our most recent one all of those restaurants are now available on grubhub so all of our advertising that were pushing in delivered dish markets youre able to order through grubhub from the ads and then actually its executed through those contracts and so labite is going to be the same thing were going to work as hard as we can to get those restaurants live on our platform and then were going to migrate the driver second and then finally were going to see if we fully migrate the brands in from a diningin perspective or not its still kind of tbd operator your next question comes from neil doshi with mizuho your line is open neil a doshi  mizuho securities usa inc great thanks for the questions matt looks like labite the model is a little bit different theres like  or  delivery fee convenience fee so any plan to migrate the pricing model for some of these acquisitions to the grubhub model or do you plan on just leaving that as is and then also if you could maybe talk a little bit about the hyatt partnership i think that was pretty interesting it seems like inroom dining for hotels is a pretty high margin business so how has that been trending i know its only been a few weeks but what are you seeing from that relationship and how do you think that can progress over time thanks matthew m maloney  chief executive officer sure neil in terms of the convenience fee weve done a lot of work around the elasticity of diner demand and what theyre looking for and we believe that we are optimizing for throughput and conversion and so absolutely any property that were acquiring we are going to update that with id say the most advanced pricing intelligence behind it the  transactional fee no matter what platform youre on absolutely hinders conversion it absolutely slows down growth and so were going to do everything we can to maximize growth in orders to restaurants so that definitely means that we will be rethinking the convenience fee that they have out there right now in terms of the hyatt partnership inroom dining in general and im not an expert in a hotel space but from everyone ive talked to is a big money loser and they dont – its a real headache and they dont really want to do it so hyatt came to us and said essentially wed like to replace our room service functionality and the kitchen space in at least some new hotels with your product and so we worked hard with them to be able to highlight the best restaurants around these new hyatt centric concepts and then we worked with them on a page and theyre doing a bunch of inhotel promotions to tell the guests at their properties that grubhub knows where the best restaurants are and if youre hungry and you dont want to go out and experience the neighborhoods then absolutely use grubhub and order in and so were continuing to work on our integrations and potentially even payment capabilities but i think that this represents a huge opportunity not just with hyatt but with other hotel chains that are looking to roll off of their kitchen commissary services operator your next question comes from ralph schackart with william blair your line is open ralph e schackart  william blair  co llc hey good morning adam just curious to give maybe a little more color context just in terms of what caused the april dag reacceleration either maybe you could rank it or sort of give some attribution from the marketing initiatives that kicked in at the end of the quarter is weather a big factor on the compares higher quality at diners any more color would be great adam j dewitt  chief financial officer yeah i mean so the color ill give you there is look certainly weather was a little bit of a headwind in april we saw – first of all the comp was easier from last year and its been a fairly wet and cool start to the spring in our biggest markets but what id say is when you look at april order growth and how its larger or bigger than the first quarter that weve been trending most of the increase has been organic so lets just say that – look if you say that a couple points of the growth was a tailwind from the weather theres still a what i would consider a significant increase in april even after accounting for that from kind of january february and march to give it some context april was our biggest order growth month since summer of last year operator your next question comes from jason helfstein with oppenheimer your line is open jason helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks two questions just any update on kind of the tech stack and the integration of seamless grubhub and for particularly like in new york when does all of that – when is it identical between the two apps and secondly just remind us the delivery fee – if the restaurants chooses to add a delivery fee does that show up in the average order value metric thanks matthew m maloney  chief executive officer sure jason this is matt so update on tech integration i think weve said before that the majority of the technical debt is complete at least on the consumer side in new york as well as any other market so from a diner perspective it is identical on the platforms whether youre on web mobile web native app it doesnt matter its all going through the same pipes now the corporate business is a little bit different its on a longer delay because thats just a tremendous amount of work that were very excited to do because its a significant differentiator in the space being able to channel local restaurants through a coordinated corporate product but thats taking a little bit longer in terms of delivery fee in the average order size i believe it is in there when the restaurant defines a delivery fee when they are doing their own delivery operator your next question comes from john egbert with stifel your line is open john p egbert  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks for taking the question given that new york is such a disproportionately large market for takeout ordering i was wondering if you could talk about some of the progress youre seeing in delivery in the outer boroughs so far i know its still early and then given that you said grubhub delivery is proving to be a better customer experience in a lot of ways than restaurants doing it themselves does this change your willingness to enter delivery in manhattan and it seems like average order uplift could offset maybe some margin concerns what are the pros and cons that you have to weigh with a decision like that thanks matthew m maloney  chief executive officer sure john so weve definitely seen a ton of growth in the outer boroughs and really if you look at a market like queens or brooklyn its very similar to other markets like chicago or philly on a standalone basis new yorks just a dramatic market for delivery in general and so we know exactly what were doing we target the highest premium high profile restaurants and we execute very efficiently at a high level of service for a low transactional fee and thats just the secret sauce that works whether its in the bronx or really anywhere else so when thinking about delivery in manhattan youre right it is a unique proposition because the ecosystem in manhattan has evolved over who knows  years and delivery is extraordinarily efficient in the city of manhattan its why i believe new yorkers and people in manhattan order roughly four times more than in most other markets is because you can order delivery from any restaurant at any time at almost zero transactional fee and so are we able to augment that and i would say it is trickier we are experimenting with delivery in manhattan i know there are other players doing it but i frankly dont know the value they bring to the system because the typical bodega will get a sandwich to your office lightening fast and i dont know why theyd need a thirdparty to do it now for restaurants that dont actually do delivery obviously theres benefit there and if youre thinking about augmenting delivery zones it has its own problems when youre trying to get cross town around rush hour so we are working in manhattan we clearly havent done a press release on it yet we dont feel like were at a critical scale to be able to pound our chest there but i think that were experimenting were trying to figure out where the value we can bring is its not as obvious as in the outer boroughs but i think manhattan is just the greatest delivery market in the world and ive said that repeatedly and so we are all in in manhattan operator your next question comes from arvind bhatia with crt capital your line is open arvind bhatia  crt capital group llc thanks for taking my question ive got two questions first one on the corporate side wondering if you can provide some color on how the trends were for that and then the  million run rate for the delivery business adam can you remind us what youre thinking the run rate might be by the end of this year adam j dewitt  chief financial officer yeah so on the first what i would say is the corporate business remember that its something in the low very low doubledigits close to  of our overall business i think it continues to be a business that we can grow in kind of the singledigits i think first quarter was in the singledigits probably a tiny bit lighter than its been in the past but still very strong and its generating a ton of cash and we think theres a lot of opportunity there its just since we have a lot of the big potential customers out there its tough to grow at a significant rate in terms of the run rate with delivery for the rest of the year i dont think we gave a full year target for what we would be doing obviously with the labite acquisition they did  million last year theres probably a little bit – theres probably some growth in there so you can add that on top – or kind of somewhere in the mids  right now and we expect to continue to grow quickly on the delivery side particularly on the organic side just to give some context i think last quarter we said we were at  million this quarter we said were at  million of that  million in growth almost all of its coming from the growth in organic delivery so hopefully that gives you a little bit more context but i dont think weve given an explicit yearend number operator your next question comes from nat schindler of bank of america merrill lynch your line is open nat h schindler  bank of america merrill lynch yes hi guys thanks a lot for taking my questions i had two quick questions one you said promotions were a little less than normal and more brand than normal one ive been seeing actually quite a few promotions just did a  one last week thanks a lot for that by the way but additionally i wanted to just go a little bit into that and see if you could give us some of the normal level of contra revenue impact that you do in promotions in the quarter and how much youre seeing now or how much youre doing now and how much has that changed secondly i think in san francisco we obviously have a lot of these delivery players and there was a restaurant i took the picture of their – in the mission  took a picture of their window and i think they had  stickers on it for different delivery players how are the restaurants reacting to basically all this noise in the market place adam j dewitt  chief financial officer so ill take the question on the promos i mean look what ill say is overall its a small enough number that youre not going to see the fluctuations quartertoquarter so much unless were doing something dramatic and to your point just to point out we are back to a more of a normal level in the second quarter and its more the first quarter where – particularly at the beginning of the first quarter where we were a little bit light but we dont rely very heavily on promotion so its just a low singledigits percent of revenue on a quarterly basis and then ill let matt give you a little color on the san francisco restaurants matthew m maloney  chief executive officer yeah hey matt i agree with you the noise is a little asinine and its kind of crazy from a restaurants perspective this is really a winnertakemost market and the restaurants really only want to deal with one or maybe two they dont like to be beholden to a single partner they feel like they want some pricing leverage and so theyll generally open up their front counters for another partner and obviously theyre going to keep the one that are actually generating real business for them and so thats what weve seen historically i think in san francisco youre at another level in terms of funded ideas but what we see is as restaurant owners are looking to manage their business and manage the knowledge transfer and execution of their hourly workers you cant realistically train them on five different tablets you want to go with the one that produces the most volume and nobody is giving up their grubhub tablets and preference for anyone else because no one drives even near the volume that we do operator your next question comes from jeff houston with northland your line is open jeff houston  northland securities inc hey matt and adam thanks for taking my questions so looking at the momentum youre having with chains can you talk a bit about how the take rates compare between chain restaurants and independents and are they generally given higher priority in the listings compared with the independents matthew m maloney  chief executive officer sure jeff chains are huge opportunity and when they talk to us and have those conversations theyre excited about two things theyre excited about the amount of volume that we can drive them in terms of business and theyre excited about the fact that we can execute delivery at a very high service level and set expectations and partner with them and so because we are bringing the business and fulfilling it they are more than happy to pay these standard rack rates and theres no economic preference given to chains in contracts whatsoever and also in terms of exposure on our platform we give them the same amount of exposure as any restaurant that produces great food and so we like to highlight our best restaurants the local favorites the chefs that are really working their tails off to produce the best food possible and many times that includes chains and so we highlight all of them based on how much business we believe we can drive them operator ladies and gentlemen this does

nonetheless our growth was deep and broad  of our markets generated more than  dags up meaningfully from  in the fourth quarter of last year net income was  million for the quarter an increase of  from the prior year adjusted ebitda was  million for the quarter growing  yearoveryear adjusted ebitda per order was  up from  per order in the prior year over the course of last year we have improved our delivery efficiency significantly allowing us to invest in product and marketing while simultaneously increasing our profitability these investments will drive growth in diners orders and ultimately ebitda we ended q with  million active diners a growth of  versus the prior year our traction in tier  and tier  markets is strong growing twice as fast as our tier  diner base this accelerating pace of diner growth was driven by our best quarter ever in active diner additions and highlights the success of our increased advertising in the first few months of the year as well as the opportunity ahead of us given our performance yeartodate we are optimistic about our ability to continue this high level of advertising throughout  while maintaining high rois we generated gross food sales of  million for our local restaurant partners in the quarter an increase of  yearoveryear while adding new restaurants helps drive our gross food sales and diner growth it also creates a rising tide that lifts all boats in our ecosystem driving more orders to all of our restaurants this network effect makes us an increasingly important partner to all our partners as the business grows restaurants that have been on grubhub for more than two years generated greater than  gross food sales growth yearoveryear in q of  its clear we provide a tremendous benefit to our restaurants and were pleased to be able to help them grow year after year this is the reason that our nondelivery commission rates have gone up every year at the beginning of  we spoke about our plan to invest more aggressively in advertising than we did last year we have improved our product our restaurant network and the overall diner experience these improvements give us confidence that when we bring on more new diners outside of our tier  markets they are going to love what they see as planned we ramped up our advertising in the first quarter we were able to increase spend effectively within online channels that were leveraged in the past like search social and a variety of other digital media in addition our improved restaurant network breadth enabled us to deploy broaderbased offline media and still yield strong returns across markets many of you have seen our national tv campaign over the past few months early results have been extremely positive driving unaided brand awareness and new diner growth primarily in key tier  markets as our tier  markets continue to grow we can more effectively push outofhome advertising on a marketspecific basis as well our diners in new york chicago and the rest of our tier  markets have always seen seamless and grubhub media around their cities were now at sufficient scale to extend that to a number of our tier  markets we had great results from these efforts in q we accelerated active diner growth posted our best quarter of organic diner net adds in the history of the company and cost per net new active diner was on par with the fourth quarter given this success we will maintain a more aggressive stance on marketing and look for efficient opportunities to spend into this strength we also continued to make great strides on our restaurant network after an outstanding fourth quarter our sales force outperformed themselves yet again and recorded our highest quarter of restaurant additions ever we are notching successes across the board not only did we add several exciting new chain partners over the past few months including tgi fridays chilis maggianos and rubios coastal grill but our existing partners continued to expand their coverage with us after strong initial pilots were now supporting around  locations for subway  for red robin gourmet burgers and over  for buffalo wild wings and over  for dennys the chain momentum is great but weve also continued our focus on adding local cult favorites that our diners love like the meatball shop in new york and revival food hall in chicago our goal is to have exactly what each diner wants the moment they come to grubhub whether thats fast food fast casual full service or valueprice points or even a white tablecloth meal delivered to their door we will have it all at the lowest possible price we are already delivering on the promise of the most comprehensive takeout marketplace in the us and we see a lot of opportunity to make it better on the product side our team continues to be heads down focused on anything and everything that can improve the diner experience and diner lifetime value our recent tests run the gamut from more complex projects like improving our sort algorithm and beta testing the dietary tags some of you have already noticed to smaller and less noticeable changes like the positioning of fields and our checkout process or upselling diners on additional items our product team is also increasingly partnering with marketing to place the grubhub ordering platform front and center for consumers however they want to engage with us whether its using alexa voice ordering on an amazon device or by sending a gift card to a friend via imessage for that special occasion finally on the operational side were moving quickly on streamlining our delivery operations and technology we discussed last quarter that we would be consolidating our rds platforms onto the grubhub brand in  and were ahead of schedule if any of you happen to have visited diningin restaurants on the run delivered dish or labite in the last few weeks then you have noticed that those sites now link consumers through to grubhub for our ui restaurant network and lower diner facing fees have the potential to increase ordering habits for the corporate clients of our acquired rds brands were now offering what we have branded as grubhub for work focused on the small business portion of the corporate market that the rds has generally served this product offers robust functionality around scheduled recurring orders catering orders and customized group ordering while in the very early stages we will refine and grow this product over time to serve the broader overall smb market nationwide were excited by the progress we have made so far in  in such a short period of time all the teams here from technology to marketing to delivery and product are reinvigorated by our success and the large and growing opportunity in front of us i look forward to giving you more updates on our success as the year rolls on and with that i will hand it over to adam who will walk you through the financials and future guidance adam adam j dewitt  grubhub inc thanks matt good morning everyone as matt highlighted in his remarks we are pleased with our start to  our active diner growth accelerated to  compared to the first quarter of last year our highest growth rate since  and easily the most net active diners we have added organically in a quarter weve processed  daily average grubs and nearly  million in gross food sales during the quarter a  increase and a  increase yearoveryear respectively the acquisition of labite which well fully anniversary in may contributed approximately  to active diner growth  to dag growth and  to gross food sales growth first quarter net revenues were  million  higher than the yearago quarter of  million if we exclude the impact from labite revenue growth would have been approximately  net revenue as a percentage of gross food sales was  during the first quarter this compares to  during the first quarter of last year we have talked about how our capture rate has increased over the past  months due to the increase in the percentage of orders that we deliver because those orders carry a higher capture rate than orders that restaurants deliver for themselves but it has also increased because as our marketplace grows restaurants want to pay a higher commission rate in return for exposure to more diners on our platform this latter dynamic while much smaller than the delivery impact has an exaggerated impact on our bottom line as nearly all of the increased revenue capture flows through to profit we hope to continue to see some benefit here over time due to our strong network growth as well as newer opportunities for restaurant visibility on our platform like sponsored listings carousels and more targeted crm matt and i have both noted the strength in new diner acquisition during the first quarter which certainly contributed to order growth however its worth noting that  of our orders come from repeat diners our cohorts remain extremely sticky and generally drive more revenue over time for example diners that ordered with us the first time in january of  generated more revenue for us in march of  than they did in march of  this creates a natural perpetual tailwind for long term revenue growth on the expense side total sales and marketing expenses were  million in q a  increase compared to the same quarter last year and a sequential increase of  compared to the fourth quarter last quarter we highlighted our intention to increase advertising spend this year and the active diner growth i highlighted earlier is a testament to our ability to maintain effectiveness at a higher level of spend of note this strength in new diner acquisition was broad in our most penetrated markets as well as our smallest newest markets when a diner joins our platform and has a good experience in terms of restaurant selection restaurant quality diner fees and service levels they tend to become habitual repeat diners given this predictability we have good insight into diner lifetime value by market and by channel this makes us comfortable spending up front to acquire diners that generate long streams of profitable revenue over time of note the strong recent growth of our restaurant network both in quantity and quality in many of our lesspenetrated markets has improved the firsttime diner experience giving us the ability to spend more dollars in these markets while maintaining reasonable cpas and high lifetime values well continue to take advantage of these opportunities as we see them however we expect sales and marketing spend to be down in the single digits sequentially because of seasonality this is less than it would typically be down in the second quarter which along with the third quarter make up the softer half of the year for us we do expect total sales and marketing percentage growth to be in the midto high s for the full year  consistent with prior expectations operations and support expenses in the third quarter sic first quarter  were  million a  increase compared to the  million in the first quarter of last year and sequential increase of  compared to the fourth quarter this increase is mostly from the steep growth in our delivery orders but also the inclusion of labite and organic growth in overall orders we continued to make very good progress on our delivery organizations efficiency once again our revenue growth per order on a nominal basis outpaced the growth in ops and support per order on a nominal basis compared to a year ago as a result ebitda per order grew from  to  during the period we are making excellent progress towards our goal of de minimis investment in delivery by the end of  technology expenses excluding amortization of web development were  million for the quarter increasing  from q of  due to investments we are making in continuous product improvement this includes the addition of folks from zoomer that we talked about last quarter depreciation and amortization was  million for the quarter a sequential increase of  from the fourth quarter and  from a year ago the yearoveryear increase is due to investment in our platform intangibles from the acquisition of labite and our headquarters build out last year ga costs were  million a sequential increase of  from the  million in the fourth quarter consistent with growth to support our business net income was  million compared to the prior year of  million net income per fully diluted common share was  on approximately  million weighted average fully diluted shares our tax rate for the fourth quarter was around  lower than our normalized tax rate of  driven by the new accounting rules for tax benefit or loss related to stock based compensation and to a lesser extent a couple of onetime credits the new accounting rules which we and other companies generally adopted in the first quarter call for a change in the recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stockbased compensation historically this impact was ignored on the pl and you would see it on the cash flow statement in the financing section the new rules dictate that these impacts move to the pl in the form of a reduction or increased income taxes in the period this change resulted in approximately eightpoint decrease to our effective tax rate in the quarter because the benefit or deficiency is generated when employees exercise options or rsus vest and depends on both the strike price or grant price of those shares as well as the market price at the time of exercise or vest it is inherently unpredictable and difficult to forecast so while our expectation for our normalized tax rate remains  going forward our actual tax rate quartertoquarter may vary significantly it is important to note that these benefits or deficiencies have always been and will continue to be real impacts to cash a reduction in taxes is a real reduction and a deficiency is a real increase in taxes its just that prior to this quarter this impact in taxes was only identified and quantified on the cash flow statement nongaap net income was  million or  per fully diluted common share compared to the prior year of  million or  per fully diluted common share nongaap net income excludes amortization of acquired intangibles acquisition and restructuring costs and stockbased compensation expense as well as the income tax effects of these nongaap adjustments adjusted ebitda for the quarter is  million an increase of  from  million in the same quarter of the prior year adjusted ebitda margin was  driven by our continued mix shift towards delivery and recent investments in marketing and technology we ended the quarter with approximately  million in cash or roughly  per share before i move into our guidance its important that i spend a moment on seasonality to help people how to think about modeling our full year in a typical year we expect warmer weather and summer vacations to reduce orders in the second quarter somewhere in the lowtomid singledigit percentages compared to the first quarter followed by another small decline in the third quarter we then see a significant uptick in the fourth quarter followed by another meaningful uptick in the first quarter once you strip away acquisitions and other noise we have seen this pattern occur consistently throughout our history  was unique with a sequential uptick in orders in the second quarter led by dramatic product improvements and weather we expect a more historical pattern to return this year and our guidance reflects that for revenue we expect q to be in the range of  million to  million and we are raising the fullyear guidance to be in the range of  million to  million this includes the healthy diner growth we saw in the first quarter as well as more confidence as to where the percentage of delivery orders is headed we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million for the second quarter and our increasing full year adjusted ebitda to be between  million and  million for the full year based on first quarter performance and updated full year expectations the seasonal impact on order growth i just detailed has a similar effect on ebitda there is a portion of our cost structure that is variable with order volume and so it declines sequentially in q along with our marketing spend our fixed cost infrastructure however typically increases modestly all things considered this translates into slight sequential declines in ebitda in the second and third quarters like order growth this ebitda trend reverses in the fourth quarter and first quarter as the activity of our diners picks back up and given the high profit flowthrough of each incremental order drives a strong uptick in ebitda from the prior two quarters we are firmly on track to meet our goals for the year showcasing our improved restaurant network and platform to more diners across the country we are excited by our performance in q and will continue to make investments to drive longterm profitable growth with that matt and i will take your questions operator please open up the lines questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of brian nowak from morgan stanley your line is open brian nowak  morgan stanley  co llc thanks for taking my questions i have two just the first one on the tier  markets it seems like youre making good traction in the markets with active diners id be curious for anything early learnings or observations of how these new active diners are acting in the new markets compared to the core markets any reason to assume that the cohorts and the purchase velocity wouldnt be similar and then secondly matt you talked about drivers of higher delivery efficiency can you just give us some examples of how youre making the delivery process more efficient what are still some lowhanging fruit opportunities to make delivery even more efficient thanks adam j dewitt  grubhub inc hey brian its adam i want to take the first and then ill let matt take the second so in terms of the diners for the tier  markets really i think its the same story that weve been seeing throughout the past several years which is you really have a difference in behavior in the manhattan and corporate diners and then the rest of the country is very similar so the tier  markets obviously theres some diversity amongst those but theyre generally in the same vicinity so if you are comparing it to the overall we obviously have a lot of business in new york and with corporate so on the average its a little bit lower but theyre behaving very similar to other markets outside of manhattan and corporate matthew m maloney  grubhub inc hey brian its matt in terms of delivery efficiency really where were seeing the gains is all around things that are scalebased so as our order volume in the market increases our ability to staff dispatch route batch orders this all improves this all drives the throughput of our driver network up and obviously our driver costs down one other element when we think about efficiency the dirty secret in all of this delivery is all the nondriver costs and people dont really talk about that breakeven on a driver pay basis is really only half the battle and weve actually found ways to noticeably improve our cost efficiency in things like driver recruiting driver onboarding gear distribution and a lot of other of these nondriver payrelated areas of delivery which overall increases our efficiency brian nowak  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of ron josey from jmp securities your line is open ronald v josey  jmp securities llc great thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask on just marketing campaigns given its coming in full swing here can you just remind us a little bit more about how you think about the roi and payback period for marketing spend and then the tools you all have to basically get these newer diners to repeat and increase and drive engagement higher and then bigger picture matt in terms of delivery have you ever thought about potentially now that delivery is in what plus markets with more national coverage potentially offering a subscription product for unlimited delivery or things along those lines thanks adam j dewitt  grubhub inc hey ron its adam ill take the marketing question so how we think about roi what i talked about in my script i think matt mentioned it as well when we have diners come on board they tend to stay with us for a very long time i think weve talked about in the past when were generating internal lifetime value models that we actually have to force attrition into the model even though were not seeing it weve always talked about the cohorts increasing in value over time after the first few months so the lifetime values are very high generally what we see on the cpa side is that its coming in generally a lot lower than our ltvs and so we feel very comfortable its just when we talk about the limits of our marketing and being able to spend efficiently we get to this point in some of these channels where the increased spending actually doesnt generate any new diners and so were generally spending to that point of what i call dramatic inefficiency if youre thinking about payback time i think it depends on channel depends where were getting the diners from and so it could be anywhere from a few months to even less to all the way up to a year but were getting payback from those diners over a very long period of time i think you asked about the reengagement i think one of the things that weve been doing differently there or weve improved on over the past  months to  months is a lot of personalization and i think part of whats enabled us to do that is especially in the tier s where weve dramatically improved the quality of our restaurant network and so were able to match specific diners with specific restaurants that we know are really popular and we have a really good hit rate because of the breadth of restaurants that we have and so being able to send an email at the right time to encourage an order on a tuesday night when a diner typically orders on a friday or saturday and get them to order more is something that weve been able to have a lot of success on matthew m maloney  grubhub inc hey ron in terms of a subscriptionlike service we have always been testing things weve tested subscription services before we havent really found that right balance of something thatll really lock in that dinerside demand and part of the problem is the economics i mean they are just tight you can do the math yourself and in order to even come close to breakeven its a pretty hefty annual fee in order to make something like this happen but remember were testing delivery fees on a citybycity basis constantly making sure that were optimizing for conversion rate and making sure we can float the economics and when we think about diners that are costsensitive remember we have over  restaurants that have free delivery always on the site because they do their own delivery and they dont have a delivery piece  so thinking about this from a competitive perspective we will always have a bakedin advantage in terms of price point for diners ronald v josey  jmp securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ralph schackart from william blair your line is open ralph e schackart  william blair  co llc good morning looking at the strong diner additions in q and clearly the marketing campaign is showing some early positive signs how should we think about the pace of that sort of diner addition throughout the year as you add on incremental marketing campaigns thanks adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah so ralph i think i mentioned in the script that even though sales and marketing i think will be down a few points in the second quarter but that thats actually a little bit higher than it would typically be in the second quarter so were going to continue to spend at a higher level overall and we expect to see good continued growth in new diners in terms of the percentage i think its a little tough to handicap obviously our guidance has a range of outcomes we have a lot of confidence that the additional spend is going to yield new diners and over time its going to lead to more order growth i think just one thing to remember for your modeling is labite we were lapping in the second quarter and i think we talked about before that something around  diners or something we acquired in last years second quarter so that will affect your modeling a little bit ralph e schackart  william blair  co llc okay thanks adam operator your next question comes from the line of paul bieber from credit suisse your line is open paul bieber  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good morning and thanks for taking my question i was hoping that you could help us reconcile the comments about the stable costs of net new active diners just for the fact that the competitive landscape is pretty intense its pretty unusual to see stable customer acquisition costs in a very competitive market so i was hoping you could provide some color about that matthew m maloney  grubhub inc sure paul i can kind of address the competition question head on and then how an increasing competitive arena impacts cpas maybe adam can followup a little bit on that market i mean i think i have answered this question pretty consistently on the past four or five maybe six earnings calls but we just continue to show great growth rates across our business and again we just posted our best quarter of diner adds in the history of the company and dont forget that all material or meaningful competition was in the market more than a year ago as well so when i look at the marketplace i see that we have significant structural advantages in that we are known for just one thing like we just do takeout ordering and we back it up with world class service and well succeed because of the singular focus and our ability to engineer our entire product around this purpose the grubhub for work products that we talked about – or i talked about today in the prepared remarks is a classic example of this weve really talked to our customers found out what they wanted how they wanted to engage with their local restaurants and we built the tool around that specific use case with only that use case in mind so industrywide i think we have a huge advantage because we clearly have the most restaurants over  now and the lowest dinerfacing fees like i just spoke about in terms of – to ron actually and so you think about – we have the best product experience we have the most restaurants we have the largest platform we have the best customer support we continue to accelerate on all fronts and its a massive marketplace so as the industry is growing and i believe competition is increasing awareness broadly which is accelerating our offline to online transition i think its just a big growth time for this industry and as you look at our distinct competitive advantages just to break it down one level deeper i mean scale – we have the largest scale in the industry and that gives us meaningful efficiency and competitive advantages others just cant reproduce the product focus i talked about thats all we do thats all we think about all of our people do this thats what we do every day were not going to be held up by delivering ipods or toothpaste or groceries we have the lowest facing fees and i believe everyone will agree that cost matters to consumers we pride ourselves on cost transparency the best service the lowest fees and were not at a significant disadvantage to anyone in terms of delivery time in fact oftentimes we are the fastest and most consistent fooddelivery option available especially during rush hour or as we call it dinner time adam adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah i – just to answer just more – just the more specific question about cpas i think what we see over time is you have to remember this is – as matt mentioned kind of were capturing an offline to online transition right and so theres more eyeballs available for us on the web and so its not a matter of having to bid more for keywords its getting more clicks and its expanding the keywords right as we expand our restaurant network so thats an easy way to think about the costs kind of remaining stable while we increase new diners i think adding high leverage out of home our offline advertising like tv that can boost the efficiency of our online digital i think are other ways that weve kind of managed to keep cpas relatively flat and as matt said look if there is competition in certain markets in some ways it is creating more awareness for the product and remember were all trying to capture some of this offline to online transition so in some ways that perhaps helps us paul bieber  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks for the insights operator your next question comes from the line of jason helfstein from oppenheimer your line is open jason helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc thanks two questions one any more commentary you can provide on competition by geography or tier size and then secondly can you talk about product features that would address caller so specifically weve done some work that suggested the biggest opportunity for you is to address basically diners who call the restaurant because they have questions and then end up ordering that way as opposed to through your app given the facebooks presentation at f about messaging and partners just some things they are doing with deliverycom maybe just talk about how you plan to address in the future being able to answer questions so that diners dont have to call restaurants thanks matthew m maloney  grubhub inc sure jason let me – i dont really have much more commentary on competition i kind of exhaustively covered that a minute ago in terms of geo and tier i think that grubhub has a very secure base in the tier  major metros and were not seeing that eroded in fact were seeing that grow and then in tier  weve said a bunch of times that this is a key focus tier  tier  on growth for us given our success in delivery over the past year and so were seeing outsized growth there clearly competition isnt impacting our growth rate there either product features on callers – calling is tricky because it requires the bidirectional communication and kind of what our product is doing is trying to alleviate the friction around the telephone and so we are definitely trying to figure out ways to answer diners questions in real time but without actually having someone at the restaurant have to pick up the phone that is a very difficult problem to solve and id say were definitely thinking about it clearly with the advent of more automated – more automated systems around like chatbots and imessage i think there is a lot of opportunity opportunities that have never been available before part of it is the actual communication another part of it is the metadata inside the menus we spoke a few earnings calls ago about normalizing menu data and making sure that our menu data is comparable and understandable from a big data perspective and weve actually continued to invest in that which is really interesting and one thing i didnt mention in the prepared remarks is that we – or i think i did actually – we rolled out with some dietary tags in the menus which are really interesting its a way for us to almost microselect dishes across restaurants that are vegan for example or other various forms of dietary tags and actually collecting that is nontrivial and keeping that updated is harder than you would expect and so were working through elements like this but as we continue to flush out more data on a dish level then it will be available to query from diners and i think thats really where youre getting at jason helfstein  oppenheimer  co inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of heath terry from goldman sachs your line is open heath terry  goldman sachs  co great thanks adam i guess just one quick housekeeping question on the – i believe i heard you say that ebitda would be down sequentially in q were you referring to the midpoint because at the higher end it looks like it would actually – of the guidance it looks like it would actually be up i just wanted to clarify that and then matt as you talk about the customers that youre – the new customers that youre bringing on and the incredible growth that you saw this quarter in customer additions do you have a sense of what the older cohorts in these tier  markets that are predominantly – are becoming predominantly deliverydriven how those perform as they age relative to what youre seeing i guess youve talked about frequency before how long do you see it taking before that once a month order in denver gets to the four to six times a month that you see in new york san francisco chicago et cetera adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah heath ill take the ebitda question real quick yeah absolutely i was referring to the midpoint our guidance obviously has a range of outcomes last year we had – our ebitda was a little bit higher in the second quarter than the first quarter but my commentary is around the second quarter we typically expect it to be all things equal we would expect a little – it just makes sense that there is a little bit of a tiny step back in kind of anticipation for the big step forward in the fourth quarter and first quarter so yeah the commentary was around the midpoint as opposed to the high end of the range heath terry  goldman sachs  co got it matthew m maloney  grubhub inc and then heath in terms of the older cohorts in the tier  tier  markets and how theyre performing with additional delivery restaurants they are all performing much higher than they were before theyre all getting better i mean if you think about cohort performance its really a function of restaurant density and so as you add restaurants to a marketplace youre going to see those older cohorts actually perform at a higher rate and i wouldnt – you are exactly right the spectrum is from the lower restaurant density markets that historically have not had a robust selfdelivery ecosystem all the way up to the high end which is manhattan which is the highest performing marketplace in the country in terms of diner performance and so as we continue to add restaurants youre going to see those cohorts perform more in line with what youd expect and id expect denver to progress to more of a chicago san francisco range before it ultimately gets up to manhattan heath terry  goldman sachs  co great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of mark may from citi your line is open mark a may  citigroup global markets inc thanks for taking my questions first i know the focus is more on ebitda per order and that there are a number of variables that come into play in the capture rate but can you talk about the top couple of factors driving the capture rate increase in the quarter for instance did sponsor listings play a key role what about the mix of delivery and then i know youve talked a lot about the performance of the tier  markets which is great i just wondered – and sorry if i missed this if you could talk about the growth rates that youre seeing in the tier  markets and how those have trended in the last couple of quarters thanks adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah mark how you doing its adam in terms of the capture rate happy to talk about that a little bit in some of my prepared remarks we talked a little bit about this clearly look most of the increase is the increase in delivery orders as a percentage of overall orders on a delivery order just to remind everyone on delivery order grubhub gets the delivery fee and also some additional commission from the restaurant and most of that goes to paying for drivers so we do see an increase in take rate its much higher on delivery orders but most of that we see come back out in the expense side but we do have and weve had historically over time had an increase in the commission rate that restaurants are willing to pay for the demand generation and so as markets grow and theres more restaurants and more diners restaurants will pay more for more exposure because theres more value on the network for them theres more orders theres a bigger audience et cetera and so restaurants are willing to pay for that exposure you asked a question – so weve certainly seen some improvement in the capture rate there its a lot smaller than the delivery mix impact but it does drop right to the bottom line you mentioned whats driving that and the sponsor listings its basically theres a number of areas on the site a number of opportunities for restaurants to get more exposure and weve been continually working on that one is the sponsor listings another is if you use the platform youll notice theres carousels whether its on the home page or at the end of menus or other locations on the site a third is i mentioned earlier more targeted crm were matching specific restaurants to specific diners and were getting better at it so theres all these opportunities for restaurants to get more exposure and theyre willing to pay more as a result so we have seen an improvement in capture rate it will be incremental over time and we think that well continue to see that mark a may  citigroup global markets inc what was the delivery mix in the quarter adam j dewitt  grubhub inc i dont think weve given specifics in terms of delivery right now if you look at delivery on our platform were at a run rate a little bit higher than  overall mark a may  citigroup global markets inc thanks any comments on tier  growth adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah so your second question tier  growth versus tier  growth i think its a similar story as it is before tier s are just by sheer size make up a large percentage of our volume so if their growth rate was significantly lower or higher than – it would be hard for tier  growth rate to be much different than the overall company growth rate i think is an easy way to say it it would be very difficult for mark a may  citigroup global markets inc thanks and tier  growing twice as fast adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah we said that in the remarks yeah mark a may  citigroup global markets inc thanks operator your next question comes from the line of nat schindler from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open nat h schindler  bank of america merrill lynch yes hi matt not to belabor the point and i know youre sick of answering this but im going to take it from a different angle clearly you have network effects making competition within your tier  markets very very difficult and its undoubtedly overtalked about by wall street but not the tier  not the tier s not even the tertiary markets but markets where you barely are quaternary markets are there markets out there that could be substantial on your longterm calculations when you start looking at the market sizing where you just havent gotten around to really building up substantial presence that you see other players building in and does that cut off any of the to be honest very longterm growth for the company and then a second question for adam just quickly you mentioned the take rates are going up on the marketplace side just wanted to know if you could give any more color on that the last time we really had a clean number for that before you had delivery i think it around  and you said it was roughly stable because new markets come in lower and old markets go up so they balance each other out where is that going and what do you think the dynamics that are really moving it around are matthew m maloney  grubhub inc hey nat yeah interesting way to position that question so i think youre right theres definitely a firstmover advantage in this industry because once you build scale and orders the restaurants really want to work with you and its that much harder to prove yourself as a secondcomer because of that for a long time weve been very aggressive expanding our services so clearly before delivery i think we were incorporating thousands of cities on our selfdelivery platform and that was our initial base and then we saw how delivery could fundamentally accelerate the market dynamics and the flywheel in these markets and so we went very aggressively into delivery a year ago and i think we immediately were at like  or so maybe  by now im not really sure markets so when you think about are there potentially substantial markets that were not in yet i would say no in aggregate there are a lot of markets were not in yet that together could be substantial for sure but no one else is there were talking broad areas in the midwest for example we hit the key markets but in between columbus and indianapolis for example we have very little or no presence in aggregate those geographies are going to be meaningful in the long term but i dont think any rational competitor is going to go aggressively into those spaces without first taking the intermediary second third and even fourth tier markets so i dont see a strategic way for a competitor to cut off our long term growth by addressing these markets first and frankly were aggressively expanding in the suburbs of indianapolis for example those are geographies that you dont see other markets or other competitors expanding and its because we do truly understand the impact of firstmover advantage in our space adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah nat in terms of the marketplace our ad fee rate or however you want to describe it were not going to break it out from the overall capture rate but what i can tell you is obviously that impact is a lot smaller on the capture rate than the delivery mix when were talking about increases were really talking about  basis points  basis points maybe  basis points at a time overall and in the first quarter we added to the commentary just because its larger than it has been but even if you look at  basis points  basis points you apply that to all of our order volume and drop it basically to the bottom line it becomes material nat h schindler  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you guys operator your next question comes from the line of michael graham from canaccord your line is open michael patrick graham  canaccord genuity inc hey thanks i wanted to go back to the diner ads just because such a whopper of a number and congrats on that you had a lot of improvements to the app over the course of the last   months and im wondering given that your diner number is an annual backwardlooking for a year im wondering if any of the strength was due to retention rather than gross adds and im also wondering some similar companies have – when they switch to more of a brand marketing emphasis television and that sort of thing theyve noticed that the customers that are coming in are more sort of focused on aligning with the brand and the experience and therefore they are stickier more active as opposed to a direct response customer coming in from search or a social ad im just wondering if youre seeing the same thing adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah hey mike how are you in terms of your question on retention it certainly helps the number and we have seen the improvements in the product help our longterm retention numbers a diner saved is the equivalent of a new diner in some ways its better but to be honest historically we havent had a big attrition problem with diners that have been on the platform for a few months so it helped but i think at the end of the day its really about the restaurant network the more efficient advertising and in this case at least its been a little bit more top of funnel than it has been the throughput on the funnel in terms of the diners id say that theyre similar as opposed to much better or much worse i think they do identify with the brand but at the end of the day you got to remember what were presenting to the market is a reason to move offline to online and so a lot of cases these diners are not coming to us after one touch right theyre seeing us on tv theyre seeing us on display theyre seeing us on sem and theyre coming to us after a number of touches and theyre high quality i think the one thing i will say is tv diners are and in all cases i think all diners are generally better if theyre coming through some type of advertising medium or some channel thats not through a promotion so if you get a diner thats coming to us because of what we do as opposed to a free meal or a free delivery those diners tend to be higher quality michael patrick graham  canaccord genuity inc okay thanks a lot adam operator your next question comes from the line of tom forte from maxim group your line is open tom forte  maxim group llc great thanks for taking my question so real quickly wanted to see how you felt about chain restaurant delivery specifically in the qsr category given that mcdonalds has started to ramp its efforts there and then second i wanted an update on the economics of chain restaurant delivery versus independent restaurants thank you matthew m maloney  grubhub inc hey tom yeah chain delivery is a big area of growth for us i went through a bunch of chains that we signed on with pilots i think that people should assume that were talking to every chain realistically that could benefit from delivery at this point i also walked through a few partners of ours that we had a successful pilot and theyre expanding our relationship which is really an important point when you think about the growth of our business especially in tier  tier  markets where chains just make up a higher proportion of not only the inventory but of what diners want to order in those geographies so i think that from a chains perspective theyve always been interested in our demand and the ability to incrementally add revenue now with our ability to deliver and deliver at a very high service level very consistently that was always a logistical hurdle that they were not interested in doing themselves for the most part i mean obviously other than the major pizza chains most chains just did not want to do delivery so the fact they can partner with us and we will support them and be their partner in this delivery function as well as bring tremendous new demand in a bunch of markets in ways that they were previously unable to do this is pretty much a slamdunk from their perspective in terms of economics i can let adam speak to that adam j dewitt  grubhub inc yeah hey tom consistently the story with the chains has been on the economic side that its not materially different than our relationships with the independent restaurants they are coming to us because we can provide something that is more efficient to get through grubhub than it is through themselves and in most cases thats a combination of the logistics and the demand generation as our pool of active diners continues to grow its close to  million now thats a way for them to drive volume where its hard to access those diners in other places so we havent found the economics to be really different between the chains that weve signed up and the independents tom forte  maxim group llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of aaron kessler from raymond james your line is open aaron m kessler  raymond james  associates inc great thanks guys just a couple of quick questions first can you just talk a little about the demographics of new users our survey work continues to show kind of younger users much more likely to join these or to sign up secondly have you guys done much delivery pricing tests and are you still testing that i have seen a lot of kind of variability on kind of delivery pricing in san francisco at least thanks matthew m maloney  grubhub inc hey aaron in terms of demographics i mean were seeing adds across the board honestly i mean clearly millennials and younger users are more apt to turn to their mobile phones for anything in their life at this point but the success of our advertising across tv and other offline channels really has brought in a wide segment of new diners and were seeing it honestly across the board from older segments through kids we see a lot of new parents spike usage through college and even younger and frankly high school kids when they have to figure out their own meal so in terms of demographics you are not going to see outsized growth in one specific segment because the entire industry is transitioning and that impacts everyone for delivery pricing tests im not sure if you are talking about fees to diners or if youre talking about fees to restaurants but in both cases aaron m kessler  raymond james  associates inc yeah fees to diners sorry matthew m maloney  grubhub inc okay yeah we are absolutely testing this i think i mentioned it earlier were testing on a per market basis were trying to figure out what is the expectation the expectation of delivery fee is set from historical norms based on what their delivery ecosystem looks like in manhattan it has always been free or very small in markets where there isnt that much delivery available they charge a higher fee in order to justify the incremental expense so were trying to gauge on a per market basis ultimately what impacts conversion the most because all we look at is lifetime value and then what happens when we decrease that fee do we see an increase in frequency do we see people turning to their local restaurants more consistently to feed their families and were just constantly looking through for both product and advertising to how do we increase the lifetime value increase the conversion increase the frequency of diners and were constantly testing aaron m kessler  raymond james  associates inc got it great thank you operator and our final question comes from the line of john egbert from stifel your line is open john egbert  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thanks for taking the question matt you noted that you are starting to push users of your acquired delivery services towards grubhub with them benefiting from lower delivery fees have you measured any change in order frequency for those customers and not to dwell too much on competition but at restaurants where you overlap with other delivery services have you looked at how your delivery fees compare on average are they meaningfully lower and if so is that something that might ever become part of targeting marketing messages in those cities thanks matthew m maloney  grubhub inc yeah sure we definitely see increased frequency as you decrease delivery fees to diners i mean its classical you reduce transactional costs and you see higher frequency of transaction theres diminishing returns i mean the difference between a  transactional fee and a  transactional fee is dramatic in terms of diner frequency the difference between a  and a  is definitely not as dramatic there is clearly segments of diners that are very cost conscious in which case they are always looking at our freedelivery restaurants which are predominantly – are actually exclusively self delivery restaurants that recognize the value of low transactional fees and i think as i said before we will always have that advantage because those restaurants do it themselves we dont have to pay for the delivery there so theres a slope of impact and then that slope definitely has a different y intercept for various markets now competitively this is even more interesting because the way that we execute we have a lower cost per delivery especially from the groups that are doing noncontracted delivery anyone who is doing noncontracted delivery your incremental cost is anywhere is from  to  and so you really cant get away with any type of diner fee less than that if you actually intend to make money at some point in the future and so we are clearly cheaper on a transactional basis for diners  and on all basis this for diners than noncontracted versus other contracted shops i think it really depends on how the restaurant contract is structured but generally we are significantly cheaper than everyone else and in fact we do use that as a key marketing message now you dont want to cheapen the value of your product because fundamentally were here for selection convenience consistently high quality service but you know what all things equal pretty much everyones going to choose the lower cost provider on that and so i think we sent out a broadbased email a week or two ago highlighting the fact that we have over  restaurants with no delivery fee and thats not a special that we have for this week or the rest of this month this is a permanent fixture of the way our marketplace works and we will always be cheaper than everyone else so i think that theres a lot of legs on that marketing communication and were going to continue to push that and if you look at the rack rates for diners in terms of delivery fee across the competitive arena i think you will agree that we are materially cheaper than everyone else john egbert  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thanks
