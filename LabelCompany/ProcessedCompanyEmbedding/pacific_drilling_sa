correspondents report on supply and demand trends corporate news government actions exploration technology and much more since its inception in  pacific drilling has committed more than  billion to establish a fleet of six newbuild drillships spending  billion through the first half of this year operations were launched august  when the first of those drillships the pacific bora began work on a contract in nigeria for chevron according to the companys filing with the us securities and exchange commission two other drillships the pacific mistral and the pacific scirocco are scheduled to initiate drilling under their contracts next month and a fourth the pacific santa ana has a contract to begin in march meanwhile beckett said he is seeking contracts for the remaining two vessels the pacific khamsin and the pacific sharav scheduled for delivery in  contract terms from pacifics fleet status report indicate the bora has a threeyear contract with chevron in nigeria at a rate of d in addition the scirocco is contracted by total on a nigerian project for one year at d the mistral by brazils petrobras in brazil for three years at d and the santa ana by chevron for five years in the gulf of mexico at d pacific drilling traces its roots to a predecessor company formed in liberia in  as a holding company that purchased a drillship under construction after forming a venture with transocean in  to manage construction of drillships for use by transocean the pacific drilling investors began to explore opportunities for forming their contract drilling company he said the original investments were viewed as financial investments said beckett those assets were put in a joint venture with transocean and transocean was operating over the course of that relationship it became evident that the greater valuecapture was to run your own rigs and run them well so that was what prompted the desire to build a new drilling contractor from scratch formed in luxembourg pacific drilling will have its operational headquarters in houston and the company already has a global staff of  beckett said the wellpublicized speculative rig and drillship building boom of the last five years helped create the opportunity to form pacific drilling as investment firms made it possible for the company to acquire its first two vessels he said in addition he said pacific benefited from the rise of a stricter global drilling regulatory regime in the last year following the april  crisis in the gulf of mexico at bps macondo exploration well it has actually helped us said beckett the vessels we are building meet the requirements of the new regulations right out of the box the macondo blowout killed  workers destroyed transoceans deepwater horizon drilling rig and created the largest marine oil spill in us history there is a fundamental advantage in that these new vessels already meet the requirements beckett said beckett said he believes pacifics position as the operator of young fleet in the postmacondo era bolsters the companys strategy of focusing solely on the single ultradeepwater market of water depths beyond  feet rather than trying to manage multiple classes of drilling equipment it allows us to be more aware of what we are doing in our space he said gary taylor garytaylorplattscomtweet tweet product finder step  choose a commodity all agriculture coal
