order arrive add to basket add to wishlist description liszts b minor sonata is now regarded as his finest work for piano and one of the pinnacles of romantic piano music this handbook opens with a survey of liszts early attempts at sonata composition  which include some wellknown pieces that hitherto have been unrecognised as sonata forms  and clears away some of the persistent myths regarding programme music in liszts output in the central chapters built around an analysis of the b minor sonata kenneth hamilton discusses various interpretative approaches arguing that the contradictory writings on the subject stem from the deliberate formal ambiguity of the piece itself  one reason for its perennial fascination perhaps the book concludes with a chapter on the performance practice

course overview lecture titles whats included your professor reviews questions  answers course overview perhaps no other region of the world has played so many different roles in culture religion and politics for so long a period of time as the peninsula of asian turkey known to the greeks as anatolia and to the romans as asia minor though today we call it turkey that name dates back only to the middle ages  years of historyfrom  bc when neolithic hunters began the transition to a pastoral and agricultural lifestyle to the founding of modern turkey in the th century this varied geographical area about the size of texas has been a crossroads of historyhomer composed the iliad and odyssey on the shores of asia minor all seven of the great ecumenical councils that defined christian theology in the centuries after the conversion of constantine took place within the boundaries of modern turkey to study the region is to study a land that has nurtured successive civilizations that have defined the western and muslim traditions that embrace so many of the modern worlds inhabitantsa handson professorprofessor kenneth w harl bases these lectures on both a lifetime of academic study and decades of his own firsthand fieldwork at sites throughout turkey he is professor of history at tulane university where he has taught since  after receiving his phd in history from yale university at tulane he has received the annual student award for excellence in teaching eight times in fall  he was the national winner of the robert foster cherry award for great teachersconquest and culturethe history of the region includes these milestones the rise of the hittites a chariotborne warrior people who struck out from their anatolian heartland to overrun the babylonian empire and fight the armies of egypts ramses ii to a standstill the trojan war a legend created from historical events of the late bronze age when achaean merchant princes and adventurers clashed swords with hittite emperors in asia minor the birth of western philosophy in the search for a rational account of all things by thinkers such as thales anaximander and heraclitus—all greekspeaking sages from what is now the aegean coast of turkey the fiery revolt of the ionian greek cities that led to the persian wars  bc and the rise of periclean athens as both the worlds first democracy and the leader of a maritime empire wealthy enough to build the parthenonthe great early victories of alexander the great that paved the way for the period of brilliant cultural and spiritual creativity we call the hellenistic age the spread of early christianity under the guidance of st paul a native of tarsus on the southern coast of asia minor the golden age of the byzantine empire which preserved the greek classics and repeatedly saved europe from nomadic invasion the muslim transformation of asia minor culminating in the ottoman empire which at its height in the th century threatened to take over europe itself change and continuitycultural change and continuity says professor harl are the main themes of this course each successive civilization inherited and modified the political social religious and economic institutions of its predecessor the scope of anatolian history can be best understood as a series of transformations in the religious landscape of the peninsula anatolia has experienced a number of major cultural and religious rewrites first by the hittite emperors then by the elites of hellenic cities next by their hellenized descendants in the roman age then by christian emperors and bishops in the byzantine age and finally by turkish rulers and muslim mystics the final chapter the transformation of muslim turkey into a modern secular nationstate is still in progress in looking at cultural changes certain archaeological sites and important monuments will be featured as examples of wider changes cultural componentsthe course can be divided into five cultural components early anatolia – bc the first lectures deal with the earliest civilizations of anatolia emerging at the dawn of agriculture in neolithic villages on the konya plain in central turkey through the hittite empire the apex of civilization in the late bronze age – bc to the emergence of phrygia lydia and persia heirs to the hittite traditions in the early iron age – bc the hellenization of anatolia – bc the shores of western anatolia came under the influence of the earliest greeks the achaeans or mycenaeans during the late bronze age although this contact inspired the epic poems of homer it was only from  bc that hellenic influence spread into the peninsula alexander the great – bc conquered anatolia and his successors transformed the region into a center of greek cities that played a major role in the civilization of the hellenistic age – bc roman asia minor  bc– ad the romans built on the hellenistic cities and institutions and anatolia was transformed into one of the most prosperous regions of the roman world and homeland of the future byzantine empire the hellenic cities of anatolia not only adapted roman institutions and culture but also influenced the roman monarchy known as the principate byzantine civilization – imperial crisis in – and christianization after  produced a new byzantine civilization on anatolian soil by  the basis of orthodox eastern europe today the byzantine empire reduced to its anatolian core weathered two and onehalf centuries of invasions and emerged as the leading civilization of medieval christendom in the th and th centuries islamic turkey since  the anatolian peninsula was transformed from a christian to a muslim land in the wake of byzantine decline and the arrival of crusaders from western europe ottoman sultans then built the last great muslim empire in the middle east and mediterranean world an empire that fragmented in the th century into a series of nationstates in  anatolia became the core of the turkish republic a muslim society that has successfully met the challenges of modernization hide full description  lectures     minutes each  introduction to anatolia the lands around the central turkish plateau have historically faced two ways the western and southern shores have been drawn to greece and europe the mountainringed interior has been linked to iran and asia proper x  first civilizations in anatolia neolithic anatolians were among the first farmers and herders dwelling in villages with sophisticated technology and organization from the sumerians to the south they learned to write and build palaces and cities x  the hittite empire beginning as invaders from the balkans the daring indoeuropean people called the hittites overran anatolias core with their war chariots and founded a dynasty that rivaled the egypt of ramses ii x  hattušaš and imperial hittite culture hittite kings became the first of many conquerors who would leave their mark on the land near their ritual capital of hattušaš they carved from the living rock a mighty openair shrine to their thousands of gods but shortly thereafter hattušaš was sacked and abandoned x  origins of greek civilization as the hittites were uniting anatolia early greeks called achaeans were visiting its western reaches from fortresspalaces at places like mycenae and pylos achaean warlords traded and raided along the shores of asia minor and in time would become the first greeks to clash with the armies of a great king to the east x  the legend of troy the most enduring legacies from early anatolia are the iliad and the odyssey c  bc how do the siege of troy and the exploits of homers warrior chieftains fit into the wider tale of imperial struggle and decline during the greek dark age – bc x  iron age kingdoms of asia minor from  to  bc migrations reshaped anatolia phrygians came from the balkans only to be overcome by cimmerian nomads c  bc in the west hittite provincials founded traderich lydia whose last king was croesus x  emergence of the polis from  bc the greeks distinguished themselves with the polis a citystate based on citizen rule and destined to influence the world by  bc athens had devised the first democratic constitution with all adult male citizens forming the sovereign assembly x  ionia and early greek civilization the archaic age – bc known in glimpses remains one of historys most creative periods its poets philosophers sculptors and architects gave birth to the mind of the west at its forefront were the greek trading cities of ionia on the coast of asia minor and the nearby islands x  the persian conquest in  bc cyrus the great of persia made anatolia part of his world empire anatolian grandees took to persian ways and life across asia minor soon bore a persian stamp only the ionian greeks stood apart when they rebelled against their persiansponsored local tyrants in  bc war flamed forth between the greek citystates and the great king x  athenian empire and spartan hegemony as the th century bc closed war among the greeks left the great king once again ruler of ionia but with a weakened empire it seemed that persian and native elites would carve out kingdoms and that ionia would again become the meeting place of east and west but alexander the great had other ideas x  alexander the great and the diadochoi in eight years beginning in  bc alexander and his macedonians overran the persian empire unexpectedly altering the course of anatolian civilization by making hellenism the leading cultural force in asia minor for the next  centuries x  the hellenization of asia minor alexanders successor dynasts promoted greek culture the attalid kings turned their fortress city of pergamum into a showcase of hellenic arts and learning that the romans admired elites poured their wealth into public display and buildings and cities knew themselves to be part of a wider hellenic world x  rome versus the kings of the east pompey charged the hellenistic cities with administering the roman provincial system in the parts of asia minor the legions conquered thanks to his reforms these rich cities paid for the civil wars – bc that destroyed the republic and made the brilliant politician octavian romes first emperor x  prosperity and roman patronage under the pax romana hellenic cities of anatolia attained their greatest prosperity and cultural accomplishment polished hellenic aristocrats sought roman citizenship and more than any other provincials imposed the notion that an emperor should act not as a ruler of subjects but as a leader of free men x  gods and sanctuaries of roman asia minor in the hellenistic and roman ages the native gods of anatolia assumed hellenic guises the record of religious life at this time is at odds with the common opinion that the public worship of civic gods including emperors declined before enthusiastic irrational mystery cults x  jews and early christians paul preached in the cities of anatolia converting hellenized jews and judaized pagans in ad  christians were still a tiny minority but with impressive institutions developed in anatolia when the convert emperor constantine r – summoned the first ecumenical council to nicaea in  a momentous new chapter in religious history opened x  from rome to byzantium after a century of crisis in the roman world constantine unified it and created an imperial church by  anatolia had undergone yet another cultural and religious transformation into a christian land anatolia had passed over into the byzantine age x  constantinople queen of cities when constantine dedicated his new rome on the site of an old greek colony on the european side of the bosporus he was founding a capital that would stand as the bastion of roman government and classical learning under great emperors such as justinian x  the byzantine dark age the restored roman empire of justinian and after faced many foes including the new armies of islam urbane classical life yielded to a martial society fortress cities rose in the interior tenacious byzantine defense broke the arabic advance and anatolia prospered for a time x  byzantine cultural revival macedonian emperors revived patronage of the arts and letters at constantinople and this cultural rebirth was echoed across anatolia in the th and th centuries by  nobles were hiring firstclass artists who painted in naturalistic styles that looked back to classical models and would influence the italian renaissance x  crusaders and seljuk turks for a century the fate of anatolia lay poised between byzantines and seljuk turks though damaged by crusader depredations the byzantines struggled to stem the turkish tide as the th century opened the outlines of a new muslim turkish civilization began to appear in anatolia x  muslim transformation the sultans sponsored a new vital muslim society that once again reshaped the religious landscape of anatolia this time with mosques and minarets the mongol attacks of the s ironically would help make possible the rise of a new turkish muslim dynasty the ottomans x  the ottoman empire the ottomans forged the last great mediterranean empire ruled

professor not surprisingly knows his stuff the course is a great topical overview and will help you identify quickly other sources of information if you want to explore the topic further date published  rated  out of  by debijo from date published  rated  out of  by tommyd from great topic but disappointing execution unfortunately i just could not get into this course and found my mind wandering way too often i hope it wasn’t a case of the lecturer’s style not resonating with me because i have already bought a number of his other courses because the topics he covers really interest me maybe this was just a specific subpar effort but the reviews are extremely high so a lot of people don’t feel that way i purchased this course because it covers the many civilizations that came to occupy this region of the world but i felt the professor didn’t do their stories justice i wished he’d spent more time introducing the peoples in a chronologicalnarrative manner but instead he seemed to assume listeners knew specific events and had a foundation of knowledge and the lectures instead felt like a fast recitationrapid fire of many civilizations and facts in some cases without discussion of a greater meaningbigger picture at times i felt lost trying to keep up and maybe that’s why my mind gave up and kept wandering i feel like the best history great courses are those that explain the basics and facts and then provide any additional details or insight the abrupt endings to lectures without a conclusion “winding down” comments or preview of the next lecture were jarring the sudden round of applause at times to mark the end of a lecture caused me to jump once or twiceno idea he was finished additionally the professor used a lot of “filler” words including “uhh” and “um” which became very distracting as the lectures wore on in one lecture i counted  in the first  minutes  for a  minute lecture just makes it way too distracting i am going to try history of the ancient world a global perspective next in the hopes of a better understanding of these civilizations date published  rated  out of  by highcking from another splendid set of lectures professor harl delivers once again a set of lectures that are crammed with information and delivered with passion style and humor over the years he is one of the real gems used by great courses not much else to say if you want to learn about the ancient history of asia minor and enjoy every minute of the experience buy these lectures and dive in date published  rated  out of  by martimedes from another rollercoaster ride from our kenneth i use his name familiarly as he seems to be part of the family now that i have watched so many of his courses i have even gotten used to his argh argh punctuations  this course is great because it fills in the geographical and historical gaps between greecerome and the middle east see also his course on the vikings for a similar historical gapfiller to the north the singularly most appalling aspect is the type of maps they are mud maps of the worst sort  like molten chocolate illuminated from the northwest giving gross shadows on the eastern side of countries in some cases this d visualisation often makes the seas stand forward  most uncomfortable certainly not up to the usual tgcs standard but dont let this one gripe prevent you from watching what is a most absorbing topic date published  rated  out of  by nicc from asia minor eastern  western trajectories professor kenneth w harl’s course great ancient civilizations of asia minor and his other classical and byzantine presentations have cleared many preconceptions and stereotypes in my understanding of history in general concepts such as the barbarian heresy paganism orientalism persecution religion etc simple but deceptive ideas have come into a much clearer refined and critical focus allowing further depth analysis and objectivity to my historical studies these lectures document the ancient civilizations that inhabited developed fragmented and transformed the political cultural social and religious landscape of asia minor anatolia  modern turkey which covers a wide time frame it ranges from early neolithic settlements  bc domestication writing merchant trade urbanization and rise in city life to the fall of constantinople and the rise in the ottoman empire  ad the professor’s empirical data and conceptual historical narrative is supplemented with the disciplines of archaeology anthropology mythology and theology helping to clarify the social processes taking place on this strategic landscape which is a geographicalcultural bridge connecting the eastern and western traditions of yesterday and today its interior mountainous plateau regions gravitate toward iran and the near east its northern shores  black sea towards eastern europe and its western and southern shores  aegean and mediterranean seas towards western europe these pulls towards the east and west are still making the headlines today these lectures focus on five major historical stages portraying the rise maturity decline crisis fall transformation and continuity of the great ancient civilizations that inhabited this anatolian landscape early anatolian period  –  bc hellenization period  – bc romanization period bc –  ad byzantization period  –  ad islamization period … whether designed or unintended the presentation is a microscopic view of macromediterranean world history through the cultural lens of asia minor’s changing landscape according to the professor the cultural and religious rewrites on this soil by the hittites phrygians lydia trojans greeks persians romans westernlatin church byzantines easterngreek orthodox church arabs turks and muslims have contributed to today’s richness of its culture which is still evolving toward modernization these earlier periods echo and are sketched with the darkness and illumination of kings generals emperors pharaohs sheiks grandees satraps sultans ghaziwarriors theologians philosophers renaissanceartistsscholars mystics caliphs popes bishops patriarchs prized cultural artifacts secularreligious architectures godsgoddesses competing theologies ecumenical councils iconoclastic controversies pagan cults christians shiitessunni muslims seljukottoman turks sufis crusaders migrations famous battles civil wars etc much still vibrating today are all documented in detail in the excellent course guidebook with accompanying maps timeline glossary biographies and bibliography should become the standard on how to organize and document a detailed guidebook – just excellent finally i close with a comment i previously made on professor harl’s byzantium lectures since it also applies here the only historical point not addressed concerns the belgian scholar henri pirenne whose work mohammed and charlemagne deals with this area and periodization of history to quote from the book cover “the cause of the break with the tradition of antiquity was the rapid and unexpected advance of islam…an event of historical proportions…causing the axis of life to shift northwards from the mediterranean for the first time in history” to hear the professor discuss critique and interpret pirenne’s thesis in light of the civilizations of asia minor and byzantium would be very enlightening indeed  an historical necessity excellent and highly recommended  date published  rated  out of  by pacificnw from another great course by professor harl professor harl has done a number of excellent courses for the great courses and this course is just as excellent as the others professor harl presents history in a manner which is both informative and entertaining a lot of the courses on ancient history start with major wellknown empires such as the persians greeks romans and egyptians this course starts at the beginning with the first known civilizations and explains the evolutionary path from these earliest civilizations to the major empires consequently this course should be one of your first courses on ancient history so that you will have an appreciation of the “big picture” before delving into the other excellent ancient history courses by professor harl and other professors who have created courses for the great courses highly recommended date published  rated  out of  by spaceaggie from date

locker kenneth minor manslaughter murder kenneth minor credit cbs  new york cbsnewyork — after being convicted of helping a motivational speaker kill himself a man known as the “harlem kevorkian” received a revised sentence on monday kenneth minor  admitted to stabbing motivational speaker and selfhelp author jeffrey locker to death on an east harlem street in  he was convicted of murder and sentenced to  years to life in prison in  but his conviction was later overturned as cbs ’s emily smith reported minor then accepted a plea deal that reduced his year sentence to  years the deal still carries the murder conviction rather than the crime being reduced to manslaughter during monday’s sentencing minor apologized to the judge for any wrongdoing “every choice i made i made myself and i accept responsibility for what i did” he said but minor maintained what he has said all along locker wanted to die smith reported minor said the motivational speaker approached him for help staging what would look like a deadly knife robbery so that locker’s family could collect his life insurance prosecutors admitted locker asked minor to help him stage his death but said minor went beyond assisted suicide when he stabbed locker seven times still defense attorney daniel gotlin said the whole case is the definition of assisted suicide or seconddegree manslaughter not murder “they knew then the deceased plotted his own death” gotlin said “they had records he was calling funeral homes and emails calling cemeteries — all sorts of documentary evidence” no one from locker’s family appeared in court during either trial or sentencing smith reported according to gotlin they took part in the plan to live off an  million insurance policy “they certainly knew he wanted to kill himself they were well aware of it” he said in court minor told the judge he’s been going to church and reflecting on life the judge declared him a changed man telling him she hopes to never see him in a court room again smith reported minor’s wife dawn said she’s glad it’s all over with “he’s just been praying and he accepts the things that he has done” she said even though minor said in court he is satisfied with the sentence gotlin said he plans to appeal yet again smith reported minor has been behind bars for five years that time will go toward his new sentence he will then be released
