unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended  april  mr glyn edwards chief executive officer of summit commented over the past quarter and in recent months we have made meaningful advances in both our dmd and cdi programmes to bring these programmes closer to the patients in need we continue to progress our phaseout dmd clinical trial of our lead utrophin modulator ezutromid in the treatment of dmd we achieved a major milestone in the programme with the completion of enrolment into phaseout dmd triggering a  million payment from sarepta in addition we have made provisions for patients in the trial to remain on ezutromid beyond the initial weeks of the trial which will allow us to monitor safety and efficacy data related to longerterm dosing we look forward to reporting week biopsy mri and functional data in the first quarter of  for what could be the first disease modifying treatment for all patients with dmd as we continue to prepare our other lead product candidate ridinilazole for phase  clinical development a recent lancet infectious diseases publication highlighted the novel antibiotics differentiation and promise as a potential treatment for cdi as evidenced by the phase  codify clinical data we believe the robust design of the phase  clinical programme which has received input from the us food and drug administration and european medicines agency has the potential to underpin ridinilazole as a potential frontline treatment for cdi utrophin modulation programme for dmd ezutromid highlights completed enrolment into phaseout dmd in may  phaseout dmd is a week open label phase  clinical trial that has enrolled  patients at sites in the uk and us the trial aims to establish proof of concept of ezutromid and is evaluating a range of muscle structure muscle health and functional endpointsexpecting to report full week data analysis from phaseout dmd in q  this data set will include week biopsy data from all patients who provide a week biopsy sample approximately  in addition summit expects to report week mri and functional data from all  patients in the trial topline data from the complete week clinical trial are expected in q  received support from an independent data monitoring committee for the extension of phaseout dmd following its interim review of safety and tolerability data the extension phase will allow summit to continue to gather longterm safety and efficacy data and is expected to last until ezutromid either receives marketing approval in relevant countries or its development is discontinued in may  summit received the necessary regulatory approvals for the extension phase cdi programme ridinilazole highlights outlined phase  development programme for the novel antibiotic ridinilazole following input from the us food and drug administration and european medicines agency the primary endpoint of the phase  trials is expected to test for superiority in sustained clinical response compared to vancomycin as the company seeks to further differentiate ridinilazole from currently marketed cdi treatments and those in latestage development preparation for the phase  clinical trials is ongoing with the trials planned to start h continuing to explore various funding options for the phase  development programme as the company seeks to maximize the value of ridinilazole options include potentially entering into a collaboration with a third party or securing meaningful nondilutive funding from government entities and philanthropic nongovernment and not for profit organisationspublished phase  codify clinical trial results in the lancet infectious diseases codify evaluated ridinilazole against the standard of care antibiotic vancomycin for the treatment of cdi the results showed ridinilazole demonstrated substantial clinical benefit over vancomycin this included ridinilazole achieving statistical superiority over vancomycin in sustained clinical response a composite endpoint of cure at the end of treatment and no recurrence  days after treatment a result which was driven by a large numerical reduction in recurrent diseaseplanning to report data from an exploratory phase  clinical trial evaluating ridinilazole against the antibiotic fidaxomicin later this year a key objective of the trial is to determine the relative impact on the patients microbiomes of treatment with ridinilazole compared to fidaxomicin operational strengthened rd team with chief operating officer dr david roblin expanding his role to include serving as chief medical officer and appointments of dr anne heatherington as head of clinical development and quantitative sciences and dr dave powell as head of research these appointments announced in may  will help ensure

and will continue to be recognised as revenue over the development period other operating income there were no sources of other operating income during the three months ended  april  compared to £

advantage of more tax efficient opportunities related to research and development expenditure operating expenses research and development expensesresearch and development expenses increased by £ million to £ million for the three months ended  april  from £ million for the three months ended  april  the increase is driven by an overall increase in investment in the dmd programme of £ million

expensesgeneral and administration expenses increased by £ million to £ million for the three months ended  april  from £ million for the three months ended  april  this increase was primarily due to

consolidated interim financial statements of summit and its subsidiaries the group for the three months ended  april  have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and international financial reporting interpretations committee ifric interpretations as issued by the international accounting standards board and as adopted by the european union and with those parts of the companies act  applicable to companies reporting under ifrs including those applicable to accounting periods ending  january  and the accounting policies set out in summits consolidated financial statements they do not include all the statements required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the group as at  january  the  accounts the  accounts on which the companys auditors delivered an unqualified audit report will be delivered to the registrar of companies following the  annual general meeting the interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention whilst the financial information included in this announcement has been prepared in accordance with ifrss as issued by the international accounting standards board and adopted for use in the european union this announcement does not itself contain sufficient information to comply with ifrss the group expects it will need to raise additional funding in the future in order to support research and development efforts potential commercialisation related activities if any of its product candidates receive marketing approval as well as to support activities associated with operating as a public company in both the united states and the united kingdom management expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of some or all of the following equity offerings collaborations strategic alliances grants and clinical trial support from government entities philanthropic nongovernment and not for profit organisations and patient advocacy groups debt financings and marketing distribution or licensing arrangements after review of the future operating costs of the business in conjunction with the cash held at  april  and the  million development milestone now due as detailed in note  subsequent events management is confident about the groups ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis the financial information for the three month periods ended  april  and  are unaudited solely for the convenience of the reader unless otherwise indicated all pound sterling amounts stated in the consolidated balance sheet as at  april  in the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated cash flow statement for the three months ended  april  have been translated into us dollars at the rate on  april  of  to £ these translations should not be considered representations that any such amounts have been could have been or could be converted into us dollars at that or any other exchange rate as at that or any other date the board of directors of the company approved this statement on  june  change in accounting policyfollowing an ifrs ic agenda decision in may  on the application of international accounting standard  government grants the company changed its accounting policy regarding charitable funding arrangements from the wellcome trust and us not for profit organisations during the year ended  january  in exchange for the funding provided these arrangements require the company to pay royalties on potential future revenues generated from these projects and also give the counterparties certain rights over the intellectual property if the compound is not exploited the ifric decision has clarified that such arrangements result in a financial liability the estimate of the financial liability is initially recognised at fair value using a discounted cash flow model with the difference between the fair value of the liability and the cash received considered to represent a charitable grant  when determining the fair value on initial recognition the significant assumptions in the model include the estimation of the timing and the probability of successful development leading to commercialisation of the project related results and related estimates of future cash flows estimated future cash flows include expected sources of revenue including commercial sales and upfront payments milestone payments and royalties from potential licensing arrangements and are calculated using estimated geographical market share and associated pricing the financial liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using a discounted cash flow model which calculates the risk adjusted present values of estimated potential future cash flows for the respective projects related to the wellcome trust and us not for profit organisations the financial liability is remeasured when there is a specific significant event that provides evidence of a significant change in the probability of successful development such as the completion of a phase of research or changes in use or market for a product the model will be updated for changes in the clinical probability of success and other associated assumptions with the discount rate remaining consistent within the model  remeasurements of the financial liability are recognised in the income statement as finance costs grant income is recognised as other operating income in accordance with international accounting standard  accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance at the same time as the underlying expenditure is incurred provided that there is reasonable assurance that the group will comply with the conditions  this change in accounting policy has been reflected retrospectively in the comparative financial statements for the three months ended  april  the opening position as at  february  is in line with comparative amounts disclosed in the financial statements for the year ended  january  the impact of this change in accounting policy on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements is a reduction in other income historically recognised a change in the level of accrued income accounted for as grant income and the recognition of a

approximately  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional adss to cover overallotments after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us as of october   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately £ million  million we currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as follows  approximately  million to  million to fund our ongoing phase b modified diet clinical trial of smt c and if successful initiate our phase  open label clinical trial and our phase  placebo controlled clinical trial of smt c  approximately  million to fund our ongoing phase  clinical trial of smt and our ongoing exploratory phase  clinical trial of smt compared to fidaxomicin  approximately  million to advance our second generation utrophin modulators future generation utrophin modulators potential diet independent formulations of smt c and our biomarker development program and  the remainder for working capital and for general corporate purposes the expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development the status of and results from clinical trials of our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management retains broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering we estimate that such funds together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to complete and report top line data from our ongoing phase b modified diet clinical trial of smt c report top line data from our ongoing phase  clinical trial of smt report top line data from our ongoing exploratory phase  clinical trial of smt compared to fidaxomicin and report initial data from our phase  open label clinical trial of smt c we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect while we anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will allow us to initiate our phase  open label clinical trial and our phase  placebo controlled clinical trial of smt c we do not expect the net proceeds will be sufficient to allow us to fund either of these clinical trials to completion pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including term deposits and shortterm investmentgrade and interestbearing instruments the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products while we believe that our technologies knowledge experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government agencies and private and public research institutions any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for ours in addition our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other thirdparty payors seek to encourage the use of generic products this may have the effect of making branded products less attractive from a cost perspective to buyers the key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy safety convenience price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors the competition for smt c and smt includes the following smt c there is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of dmd applicable to all dmd patients that seeks to alter the progression of the disease corticosteroids such as prednisolone and deflazacort are the current standard of care for dmd patients although these are symptomatic treatments that do not address the underlying cause of dmd and their use can be associated with severe side effects and concerns over weight gain other companies are developing alternative therapeutic approaches to the treatment of dmd a number of which are outlined below nonsense mutations ptc therapeutics inc or ptc is developing translarna ataluren the european commission has granted conditional approval for translarna in europe and ptc is preparing to commercialize translarna in several european countries ptc has also commenced a rolling nda submission to the fda for translarna ptc is currently enrolling patients into a phase  confirmatory clinical trial of translarna translarna is a small molecule that enables formation of functional dystrophin in dmd patients with nonsense mutations dmd caused by nonsense mutations affects approximately  of all dmd patients exon skipping prosensa holding nv or prosensa and sarepta therapeutics inc or sarepta are developing treatments for dmd based on exonskipping approaches exons are organic molecules known as nucleotides within the dna strand that the cellular machinery translates to make fulllength functional protein in a subpopulation of dmd patients synthesis of the dystrophin protein is disrupted because of mutations that may be due among other things to deleted exons exonskipping technology seeks to allow the production of a shorter but still functional dystrophin protein prosensa’s most advanced exonskipping drug is drisapersen prosensa has submitted an nda for drisapersen with the fda seeking accelerated approval and has stated that it expects the fda to complete its review in the first quarter of  prosensa has further stated that it plans to seek conditional approval of drisapersen in the european union in early  drisapersen targets exon  and would be applicable to approximately  of all dmd patients prosensa was recently acquired by biomarin pharmaceutical inc sarepta’s most advanced product candidate is eteplirsen sarepta has indicated it will file an nda for eteplirsen with the fda by mid eteplirsen also targets exon  and would therefore be applicable to approximately  of all dmd patients prosensa and sarepta are also developing other exon skipping therapies to treat other genetic mutations these companies have product candidates in clinical trials that are targeting exon  which is applicable to  of all dmd patients exon  which is applicable to  of all dmd patients and exon  which is applicable to  of all dmd patients according to an article published in  in the peer reviewed journal human mutation skipping of the ten most common exons would treat in the aggregate approximately  of all dmd patients we believe that there are exonskipping therapies currently in clinical development to address four of these exons and that skipping of these exons would treat in the aggregate less than onethird of all dmd patients other dmd approaches a number of other companies are pursuing alternative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of dmd tivorsan pharmaceuticals is developing a recombinant form of biglycan a protein that is naturally produced in the body and regulates production of utrophin in developing muscle which is currently in preclinical development askelepios biopharmaceuticals inc is developing biostrophin a gene therapy approach that is currently in phase  clinical development pfizer inc or pfizer is pursuing an approach based on muscle tissue growth through myostatin inhibition pfizer completed a phase  healthy volunteer clinical trial of its product candidate myostatin antibody pf in  and recently announced the initiation of a phase  clinical trial in patients with dmd santhera pharmaceuticals completed a phase  clinical trial of its product candidate idebenone in  and reported that idebenone delayed deterioration in respiratory function akashi therapeutics is developing ht an antiinflammatory and antifibrotic small molecule that aims to reduce fibrosis and inflammation akashi therapeutics is currently conducting a phase ba clinical trial of ht smt several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have established themselves in the market for the treatment of cdi and several additional companies are developing products for the treatment of cdi we expect that these products will compete with smt antibiotics the current standard of care for cdi is treatment with the broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and metronidazole both of which are available in generic form in the united states generic antibiotic therapies typically are sold at lower prices than branded antibiotics and generally are preferred by managed care providers of health services the antibiotic fidaxomicin was recently approved for the treatment of cdi in the united states and the european union fidaxomicin was originally developed by optimer pharmaceuticals inc which was later acquired by cubist pharmaceuticals inc or cubist cubist was recently acquired by merck  co inc or merck other antibiotics in latestage clinical trials for treatment of cdi include surotomycin which is being developed by cubist and is currently in phase  clinical development and cadazolid which is being developed by actelion pharmaceuticals us inc and is currently in a phase  clinical development other cdi approaches a number of other approaches for the treatment of cdi are in development merck is developing the monoclonal antibodies actoxumab and bezlotoxumab both of which are in phase  clinical trials these antibodies neutralize certain toxins that are produced by c difficile bacteria and would be an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics sanofi pasteur is developing the vaccine acamcdiff for primary prevention of cdi acamcdiff is likely to be used only in highrisk patients given the difficulty of administering a vaccine to a broad population fecal biotherapy aims to recolonize the bacteria that comprise the natural gut flora and would also be adjunctive therapy to antibiotics fecal biotherapy approaches in development include ser which is being developed by seres health inc and recently completed a phase  open label clinical trial and rbx which is being developed by rebiotix inc and has completed a phase  open label clinical trial company description we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of novel medicines for indications for which there are no existing or only inadequate therapies we are conducting clinical programs focused on the genetic disease duchenne muscular dystrophy or dmd and the infectious disease clostridium difficile infection or cdi our dmd program is based on utrophin modulation an approach to treating dmd that is independent of the underlying mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease we are a leader in the field of utrophin modulation an approach that we believe has the potential to address the entire population of dmd patients other dmd approaches such as exonskipping and suppression of nonsense mutations only address subsets of this population our lead dmd product candidate is smt c an orally administered small molecule we expect to report top line results from our second phase b clinical trial of smt c in the third quarter of  our lead cdi product candidate is smt an orally administered small molecule antibiotic smt is designed to selectively target clostridium difficile bacteria without causing collateral damage to the gut flora and thereby reduce cdi recurrence rates which is the key clinical issue in this disease we expect to report top line results from
