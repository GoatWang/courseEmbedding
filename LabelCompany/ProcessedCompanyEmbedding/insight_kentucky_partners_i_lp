dixon judge appellant insight kentucky partners ii lp appeals from a judgment of the jefferson circuit court following a jury trial finding it liable to appellee preferred automotive services inc for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty by jerry key preferred’s former general manager preferred has filed a crossappeal challenging the trial court’s reduction of the jury’s award of punitive damages as well as the denial of preferred’s motion to amend its complaint to add a trade secrets claim for the reasons set forth herein we reverse and remand the matter for a new trial preferred was formed in  to provide vehicle repair and maintenance services brothers brian payne and jack payne together owned eighty percent of preferred with key owning the remaining twenty percent key was responsible for all of preferred’s daily operations preferred’s corporate report filed with kentucky’s secretary of state identified key as president vicepresident treasurer and sole director soon after preferred’s formation insight began using preferred for all of its local vehicle fleet maintenance and repair work key was the primary contact and managed all of insight’s business with preferred during the time period that preferred provided services to insight bob mathena and todd knight were the insight employees responsible for the company’s vehicle fleet maintenance it is undisputed that preferred and insight never entered into any type of contract in june  the paynes accused key of embezzling from preferred rather than terminate key however the paynes chose to take over all financial responsibilities although key continued to manage the other daily operations however preferred’s annual corporate report filed in july  identified brian  payne as president jack payne as vicepresident and both paynes as the only directors of preferred key was listed only as a shareholder preferred’s  annual report contained the same information except that key was no longer identified in any capacity on january   the paynes again accused key of embezzling money from preferred key contended that he was terminated on that date and never returned to or had any further responsibilities with preferred indeed the record herein contains preferred’s payroll records reflecting that key was “terminated ” as well as a letter dated february   from brian payne to preferred’s vendors stating that “key is no longer employed by preferred automotive as of january  ” in addition payne testified at trial that key had no authority to do anything on preferred’s behalf after january   nevertheless preferred claimed that key was not terminated on january th but rather took “time off to think about the situation” and intended to return to work preferred contended that despite its records to the contrary key in fact remained an employee until january   because he had a company cell phone and insurance benefits until that date as well as remained a corporate director until   curiously in july  shortly after preferred instituted legal action against key preferred filed its  annual corporate report which identified key as a director for the first time since  although key maintained that he had not been identified on a corporate report in any capacity since  he nonetheless executed a formal resignation of any purported director status  sometime between january th and january th key met with mathena and knight and discussed the possibility of insight moving its business if key obtained employment elsewhere at the end of january  key met with robert johnson the owner of southside automotive and arranged to rent a building to start a vehicle fleet maintenance business to compete with preferred key hired two of preferred’s longtime mechanics and began operations under the name of southside automotive around the middle of february  insight began sending some of its vehicles to southside at the same time insight also increased its use of other vendors including nationwide truck service for maintenance work jim berry collision center for body work and mosby towing for towing services in march  a billing dispute arose between preferred and insight specifically in a march th letter to bob mathena brian payne accused insight of defamation by “passing rumors” that preferred was double billing and otherwise cheating insight as evidenced through a string of internal emails insight thereafter made the decision to terminate its relationship with preferred noting specifically that there was no contract prohibiting it from doing so in june  preferred filed an action against key asserting breach of fiduciary duty conversion and fraud that lawsuit was settled in  preferred thereafter filed a lawsuit against southside and johnson in august  alleging aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty misappropriation of trade secrets and tortious interference that lawsuit similarly settled in november   in january  preferred filed the instant action against insight alleging that insight  tortiously interfered with a noncompete agreement between key and preferred and  aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty owed by key to preferred a nineday jury trial was held beginning january   preferred sought  in lost profit damages despite not having a contract preferred based its damages upon the assumption that insight would have continued to send all of its business to preferred from the time preferred lost insight as a customer in  until  preferred also sought  million in punitive damages at the close of preferred’s proof the trial court granted insight’s motion for a directed verdict on the tortious interference claim with respect to the aiding and abetting claim preferred asserted that insight knew that key owed fiduciary obligations to preferred and it nonetheless helped key breach that duty by assisting him in establishing a new business to compete with preferred and by encouraging key to utilize confidential information he obtained from preferred for insight’s benefit and to the detriment of preferred at the close of evidence the jury found that insight aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty owed by key to preferred and awarded  million in compensatory damages and  million in punitive damages the trial court apportioned the compensatory damages  to key  to insight and  to preferred as a result the original trial judgment awarded preferred  million in damages  insight thereafter filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov as well as motions to alter amend or vacate the judgment and for a new trial following an extensive hearing the trial court denied the jnov and new trial motions however the trial court granted the motion to alter amend or vacate in part by reducing the punitive damages award from  million to  motion on the grounds that the award was the result of “passion prejudice andor bias as to insight’s financial status and sympathy for employees of preferred given insight’s degree of reprehensibility and the lack of contact between the parties” insight then appealed to this court preferred has filed a crossappeal on several issues additional facts are set forth as necessary before we turn to the issues herein we would note that this case involved a nineday trial and a voluminous record the hearing on insight’s posttrial motions lasted over two hours and involved a multitude of issues yet the trial court made no rulings from the bench nor did it include any findings or rationale in its orders denying the motions for jnov and new trial in certainteed corporation v dexter  swd   ky  our supreme court in reviewing an appeal from a trial court order granting a new trial commented the reason appellate courts defer to the trial courts decision to grant a new trial is because the decision may depend on factors that do not readily appear in the appellate record such as witness demeanor and observations of the jury    but that deference does not make such decisions beyond review thus it is crucial that the factors going into the decision appear somewhere in the trial record or else there may be no record of them at all even if the record is complete the trial judges  evaluation of this evidence recorded as findings of fact in support of the decision are just as important at least from the appellate perspective otherwise an appellate court has to sift through a voluminous record to see what possibly could have been the basis for the ruling which wastes judicial resources and begs for erroneous reversals in this case for example the trial court simply found that the jurys verdict in the first trial was “manifestly unsupported by the evidence and manifestly a product of jury passion and prejudice” while these are findings of fact of a sort they lack of any discussion of the evidence supporting them which makes their review difficult though cr kentucky rules if civil procedure  does not currently require them the better practice is for a trial court to include in its order at least some specific findings regarding the evidence or lack of evidence that supports the ultimate decision to grant or deny the motion for a new trial admittedly our review of this matter has been made more difficult because of the absence of any findings or reasoning supporting the trial court’s rulings on the posttrial motions given the complexity of this case the trial court’s evaluation of evidence and factors not readily apparent from the record would have greatly benefitted this court in our review with that we now turn to the issues presented directed verdictjnov insight first argues that the trial court’s judgment should be vacated because preferred failed to prove the necessary elements of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty as such insight contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant its motions for a directed verdict andor jnov  the standard of review regarding a motion for a directed verdict or jnov has been described as a difficult one for an appellant to meet peters v wooten  swd   ky app  in taylor v kennedy  swd  ky app  a panel of this court described it as follows in ruling on either a motion for a directed verdict or a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict a trial court is under a duty to consider the evidence in the strongest possible light in favor of the party opposing the motion furthermore it is required to give the opposing party the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference which can be drawn from the evidence and it is precluded from entering either a directed verdict or judgment nov unless there is a complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action or if no disputed issue of fact exists upon which reasonable men could differ id at  citation omitted in reviewing evidence supporting a judgment entered upon a jury verdict the role of an appellate court is limited to determining whether the trial court erred in failing to grant the motion for a directed verdict or jnov see bierman v klapheke  swd  ky  ncaa v hornung  swd  ky  all evidence which favors the prevailing party must be taken as true and the reviewing court is not at liberty to determine credibility or the weight which should be given to the evidence these being functions reserved to the trier of fact we may not disturb the trial court’s ruling unless the decision is clearly erroneous peters v wooten  swd   ky app  citing bierman  swd at  as such a denial of a directed verdict or jnov “should only  be reversed on appeal when it is shown that the verdict was palpably or flagrantly against the evidence such that it indicates the jury reached the verdict as a result of passion or prejudice” id citation omitted kentucky follows the restatement second of torts §  in defining the elements of aiding and abetting to prevail on a claim of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty a plaintiff must prove the following elements  the existence and breach of a fiduciary relationship  the defendant gave the breaching party “substantial assistance or encouragement” in effectuating the breach and  the defendant knew that the partys conduct breached that fiduciary duty miles farm supply llc v helena chem co  fd   th cir  citations omitted applying kentucky law insight claims as it did in the trial court that preferred failed to prove any of the above elements preferred had to first prove that key breached a fiduciary duty a claim for breach of fiduciary duty requires that a plaintiff allege that “ the defendant owes a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff  the defendant breached that duty and  the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the breach” fastenal co v crawford  fsuppd   e d ky  “the scope of the fiduciary duty has been variously defined as one requiring utter good faith or honesty loyalty or obedience as well as candor due care and fair dealing” lach v man owar llc  swd   ky  quoting anthony v padmar inc  sed   sc ct app  preferred alleged that while key was still a fiduciary he  formed southside to compete with preferred   misappropriated preferred’s confidential information about insight’s vehicle fleet and  hired preferred’s “key” employees preferred also argued that key breached his fiduciary duties throughout the tenure of his employment by diverting resources to insight in the form of free service perks to insight employees and gift cards to mathena and knight insight contends that the evidence at trial affirmatively established that key was not a fiduciary after january   when he was terminated from preferred insight relies upon the decision in aero drapery of kentucky inc v engdahl  swd   ky  wherein the court held that the end of a fiduciary relationship coincides with the “termination of actual responsibilities” insight points out that even if preferred’s position that key was not terminated until january   is taken as true preferred nonetheless conceded that he had no responsibilities or authority to act on behalf of preferred after january   consequently insight argues that key did not breach any fiduciary duty to preferred as insight notes “settled law permits an employee to prepare to compete with his employer before leaving the company provided the employee does not act unfairly or otherwise injure his principal before the departure” miles farm supply llc  fd at  further a fiduciary may compete after the fiduciary relationship has ended see aero drapery  swd at  and even has the right to solicit a former employee’s customers venture express inc v zilly  swd   tenn app  as such insight contends that  key did not breach any fiduciary duty because southside did not begin operations until after he was terminated from preferred similarly insight argues that key did not misappropriate any confidential information but rather utilized his own knowledge and skills that he acquired while employed by preferred the business information that preferred contends was confidential included  the repair history of insight’s vehicles  information regarding the parts used on the vehicles  warranty information on those parts  pricing of the repair work done on insight’s vehicles and  the inventory necessary to maintain insight’s fleet insight points out however that much of that information was included on the service invoices provided to insight the record indicates that the invoices typically contained the year make and model of the repaired vehicle the repaired vehicle’s license number insight’s unit number and vin number the repaired vehicle’s mileage the parts installed on the vehicle including the part name number and price the hours spent on labor and the amount charged for labor moreover insight argues that it was certainly entitled to the maintenance and repair information on its own fleet and would certainly have had the right to provide that information to another vendor to whom it used for maintenance insight posits that after termination of the fiduciary relationship key was permitted to “carry with him his personal experience enterprise and knowledge” to compete with preferred stewart v kentucky paving company inc  swd   ky app  quoting aero drapery  swd   finally insight argues that preferred’s claim that key breached his fiduciary duty by hiring preferred’s employees is without merit because the evidence was undisputed that key hired mechanics tyler boone and quentin stevens after they were terminated by preferred furthermore insight claims that any hiring prohibition applies only to “key” employees and preferred’s own expert essentially testified that it is common for auto mechanics to frequently change jobs to establish aiding and abetting preferred had to next prove that insight provided key substantial assistance or encouragement in the alleged breach of fiduciary duty preferred alleged that insight helped key by  telling key it would continue to do business with him and  verifying that southside met insight’s insurance requirements and could handle its fleet maintenance restatement second of torts §  provides that “substantial assistance” means that a defendants conduct was a substantial factor in causing the tort aetna casualty  surety co v leahey const co  fd   th cir  the comments to §  list factors to consider when determining whether substantial assistance has been provided “the nature of the act encouraged the amount of assistance given by the defendant his presence or absence at the time of the tort his relation to the other and his state of mind” id citation omitted further “substantial assistance means something more than merely providing routine professional services that aid the tortfeasor in remaining in business but do not proximately cause the plaintiffs’ harm” el camino resources ltd v huntington national bank  fsuppd   wd mich   insight argues that its decision to send its vehicles to southside cannot be substantial assistance or encouragement because it was under no contractual obligation to do business with preferred in other words because insight had no contract with preferred its decision to direct business to southside cannot result in liability for loss of that business furthermore insight argues that mathena and knight’s conversations with key about starting a new business can likewise not be considered substantial assistance because key had no fiduciary duties after january th finally insight points out that verifying that southside met its insurance requirement was done in the routine course of business and cannot support aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty banco industrial de venezuela ca v cdw direct llc  fsuppd   sdny  insight finally claims that there was no evidence presented that it had knowledge that key was a fiduciary or that his conduct may be a breach of his fiduciary duty insight argues that constructive knowledge does not suffice and that preferred had to show that insight actually knew not just that key’s conduct breached a fiduciary duty but also that he did not have consent from preferred to seek out other opportunities miles farm supply llc  fd at  insight points out that brian payne in meeting with insight employees on several occasions never informed them that key remained a fiduciary and in fact specifically stated that key had been terminated as of january th therefore insight contends that preferred failed to present any evidence that insight had actual knowledge that  key remained a fiduciary after  being terminated  key’s competition at southside breached a fiduciary duty  key’s use of nonconfidential information about insight’s own vehicles breach a fiduciary duty or  key’s hiring of former preferred employees breached a fiduciary duty thus insight maintains that preferred failed to prove the necessary elements of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and that the trial court erred by not granting its motions for a directed verdict or jnov admittedly this is a very close case initially we harbor doubts as to whether key was a fiduciary at the time he allegedly met with mathena and key or when he started southside automotive insight claims that key was terminated on january th while preferred maintains that he only took time off with the intention of returning to work after that date undoubtedly preferred’s claim that key remained a director until  is disingenuous at best the record clearly indicates that he had not been listed in any capacity on preferred’s corporate reports since  and it was only after litigation commenced that he reappeared as a director nonetheless because there is some question as to whether key remained employed until january th we cannot conclude that there is a “complete absence of proof” that key was a fiduciary at the time of the alleged tortious conduct further if key’s employment did not end until january th and if preferred is given every fair and reasonable inference from the evidence it is not beyond reason that a jury could have found he breached his fiduciary duties to preferred  with respect to insight’s participation in key’s alleged breach preferred introduced some evidence that mathena and knight were aware that key continued to have fiduciary “obligations” to preferred at the time they discussed moving insight’s business to keysouthside preferred alleged at trial that insight managers received kickbacks from key and that is why they “colluded’ with him to compete against preferred again while the evidence of record that insight aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty is certainly weak we simply cannot find that there was a complete absence of proof on the issue the trial court in ruling on insight’s motions for a directed verdict and jnov was required to give preferred the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference which could be drawn from the evidence furthermore it is not this court’s function to determine the credibility or the weight afforded to the evidence although we do not know the basis for the trial court denying the motions we are compelled to find that there did exist sufficient disputed issues of fact upon which a reasonable jury could have differed so as to preclude a directed verdict or jnov therefore the trial court did not err in denying insight’s motions jury instructions insight next argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on breach of fiduciary duty aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty the proper measure of damages and apportionment of fault  it is wellsettled that kentucky follows the bare bones approach to jury instructions in all civil cases olfice inc v wilkey  swd   ky  see also meyers v chapman printing co  swd   ky  however fundamental to that approach is that all of the bones must be presented to the jury correct instructions are absolutely essential to an accurate jury verdict the function of instructions is to tell the jury what it must believe from the evidence in order to resolve each dispositive factual issue in favor of the party who has the burden of proof on that issue see webster v commonwealth  swd  ky  cert denied  us   in light of the importance of correct jury instructions erroneous instructions are presumed prejudicial mckinney v heisel  swd   ky  if it cannot be affirmatively shown that no prejudice resulted from the erroneous instruction reversal is required id insight first challenges the instruction given on the law of fiduciary duty instruction no  provided a fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust and confidence that one person or entity places in another the person in whom trust or confidence is placed is said to have a “fiduciary duty” this duty includes that he act primarily for the benefit of the other party in matters within the scope of their relationship it was the duty of key to exercise the utmost good faith toward preferred auto while he was an officer director employee andor general manager of preferred auto by acting in preferred auto’s best interests by disclosing any conflict between his private interests and corporate  interests and by not competing with preferred auto or profiting at its expense after termination of key’s fiduciary relationship key could not use his prior fiducial information contrary to preferred auto’s interests nor take with him key personnel to operate a competing enterprise insight contends that the instruction should have stated that key could not use prior “fiducial confidences” to the detriment of preferred instead the trial court used the term “fiducial information” which insight maintains is meaningless and could have included any information confidential or otherwise key learned while he was a fiduciary we agree a fiduciary is prohibited from using only confidential information that belongs to a former employer aero drapery  swd at  “after the termination of his fiduciary relationship    he may carry with him his personal experience enterprise and knowledge but he may not use prior fiducial confidences” id at  emphasis added see also baptist physicians lexington inc v new lexington clinic psc  swd  ky  davis v davis  swd  ky app  stewart v kentucky paving co  swd  ky app  contrary to preferred’s position we do not believe that a jury would necessarily interpret “fiducial information” and “fiducial confidences” as being one in the same the term “fiducial” in and of itself is vague and when coupled with “information” becomes far too broad and meaningless see dsg corp v anderson  fd   th cir  holding that the district court should have provided the jury with any guidance  concerning what the term “fiducial confidence” means we are of the opinion that the instruction did not properly inform the jury that key was only prohibited from using confidential information that belonged to preferred we also agree with insight that instruction no  erroneously instructed the jury that after the termination of key’s fiduciary relationship with preferred he could not hire key personnel employed by preferred in fact the law is that “he cannot while still a corporate fiduciary set up a competitive enterprise or resign and take with him the key personnel of the corporation for the purpose of operating his own competitive enterprise” aero drapery at  emphasis added citations omitted see also baptist physicians lexington inc  swd at  “while kentucky law is not extensive it is nonetheless instructive regarding the duties of a corporate director who plans to compete the conduct alleged by nlc misuse of corporate information and recruiting of nlc personnel prior to resignation if proven would support a claim for breach of the physicians common law fiduciary duties” emphasis added the wording of the instruction herein essentially stated that key could never hire key personnel of preferred even after his fiduciary duties ceased even accepting as true preferred’s dubious argument that its mechanics were “key personnel” once key was no longer a fiduciary of preferred he was not prohibited from recruiting any of preferred’s employees see b  l corp v thomas and thorngren inc  swd   tenn ct app  “we therefore find that the trial court properly premised its finding that defendants breached their  duties of loyalty to b  l upon defendants wrongful solicitation of employees benson and donnelly prior to their termination or resignation from b  l” accordingly we conclude that instruction no  erroneously misstated the law regarding breach of a fiduciary duty insight next argues that the trial court’s instruction on aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty was erroneous instruction no  provided as follows instruction no  if you answered “yes” to interrogatory no  you will now consider whether insight communications is liable for aiding and abetting jerry key’s breach of fiduciary duty to find that insight communications aided and abetted jerry key in breaching a fiduciary duty to preferred auto you must determine that a insight knowingly joined with encouraged aided or gave substantial assistance in the actions constituting the breach of fiduciary duty and b preferred auto suffered damages indeed the aboveinstruction differs significantly from the language of restatement second of torts § b which states for harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another one is subject to liability if he    b knows that the other’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and give substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself the restatement standard clearly requires both  knowledge of the breach of fiduciary duty and  substantial assistance or encouragement to the fiduciary to  breach such duty see miles farm supply llc  fd at  the trial court’s instruction however combined the requirements and allowed the jury to find for preferred upon a finding that insight knowingly joined assisted or encouraged key contrary to the restatement the jury was not required to specifically find that insight had actual knowledge of key’s alleged breach the wording is made all the more erroneous because it only required the jury to find that insight knowingly joined with encouraged or aided key which unquestionably departs from the substantial assistance requirement contained in §  clearly the law requires that the encouragement aid or assistance be substantial id however the instruction herein failed to provide the “substantial” qualifier to the relevant actions and essentially authorized the jury to find that any encouragement aid or assistance on insight’s part constituted aiding and abetting consequently we must agree with insight that instruction no  erroneously misstated the law on aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty insight also argues that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the measure of damages specifically instruction no  provided if you have found for preferred auto and answered “yes” to interrogatories no  and  then you may award preferred auto such damages as will reasonably compensate it for the losses it has suffered in awarding damages you will exclude from the amount of the award so much of preferred auto damages as you are satisfied from the evidence could have been avoided through the exercise of ordinary care in attempting to continue its business by seeking new customers  from the evidence please set forth the amount of money that will compensate preferred auto for insight’s aiding and abetted sic the breach of fiduciary duty of key insight contends that the trial court was required to instruct the jury that it could only award damages that preferred suffered as a direct result of insight’s aiding and abetting key’s breach in the baptist physicians of lexington inc decision our supreme court stated if nlc establishes a breach of fiduciary duty by any of the physicians or aiding and abetting by baptist the recoverable damages are those caused by the actual breach of those duties not some portion of the revenue stream generated by the physicians through their medical practices after their departure     while quantifying the damages that a corporation incurs when a director improperly uses confidential information or hires corporate employees for a competing venture is not an easy task courts in other jurisdictions have tackled the task see eg b  l corporation v thomas and thorngren inc  swd  tenn app  monotronics corp v baylor  illappd   illdec   ned   when fiduciary duty breaches are proven kentucky trial courts and juries are equally capable of making damage causation determinations on a casebycase basis  swd at  as preferred points out the final sentence of the instruction did instruct the jury to award an amount of money that would compensate preferred for insight’s tortious conduct nonetheless the prior language in the instruction can also be interpreted as allowing the jury to award such damages as would reasonably compensate preferred for its losses in general including those  unrelated to insight’s alleged tortious conduct that language when coupled by improper expert testimony regarding preferred’s lost profits also discussed in this opinion certainly could have resulted in the jury awarding preferred damages for losses that it may have sustained as a result of losing insight’s business but that were not directly attributable to any tortious conduct insight next argues that instruction no  pertaining to apportionment of fault erroneously omitted southside and johnson insight contends that it introduced sufficient evidence including preferred’s complaint against southside and johnson claiming that key misappropriated information belonging to preferred for southside’s benefit and preferred’s demand letter claiming that key left preferred to work for southside to warrant including southside and johnson in an apportionment instruction pursuant to kentucky revised statutes krs  “if there is an active assertion of a claim against joint tortfeasors and the evidence is sufficient to submit the issue of liability to each an apportionment instruction is required whether or not each of the tortfeasors is a partydefendant at the time of trial” floyd v carlisle construction co inc  swd   ky  emphasis added see also savage v three rivers medical center  swd   ky  insight suggests that the decision in certainteed corp v dexter  swd  ky  stands for the proposition that a complaint filed against a nonparty is sufficient to submit an apportionment instruction that includes that nonparty party in fact however our supreme court in certainteed held that  emptychair defendants who have settled are to be treated no differently than participating defendants in regard to what must be proved to apportion fault against them though the emptychair defendant will not actually be held liable in the trial since it is literally not on trial a participating defendant must still prove liability on the part of the tortfeasor onto whom it seeks to shift some of the blame id at  as stated more explicitly in a case in which the instructions improperly allowed the jury to apportion damages to parties without finding them at fault fault may not be properly allocated to a party a dismissed party or settling nonparty unless the court or the jury first finds that the party was at fault otherwise the party has no fault to allocate    the mere fact that a party has been sued or has settled does not permit the factfinder to allocate part of the total fault to that party owens corning fiberglas corp v parrish  swd   n   ky  citation omitted see also morgan v scott  swd   ky  “fault may be apportioned only among those against whom the evidence of liability was sufficient to allow submission of the issue of fault to the jury” we are of the opinion that insight failed to meet its burden of proving that southside and johnson knew key owed a fiduciary duty to preferred or that they provided substantial assistance to key in breaching that duty that preferred stated claims against both does not satisfy insight’s burden of proving their liability so as to shift the blame accordingly the trial court has the authority to deny requested instructions and if there is doubt that the evidence supports the giving of an instruction their decision to do so will only be reversed for an abuse of discretion see olfice inc  swd at   nazar v branham  swd  ky  based on the record before us we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding southside and johnson from the apportionment instruction erronous evidentiary rulings insight first argues that testimony from preferred’s damage expert james gravitt should have been excluded under kentucky rules of evidence kre  as it was unreliable and based on assumptions we agree at trial gravitt testified that he was bound by the professional standards of the american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” gravitt explained that the aicpa practice aid on calculating lost profits requires a link between the wrongful act and the resulting damages gravitt stated that he calculated preferred’s damages as being  which represented its lost profits from the time insight ceased doing business with preferred until brian payne’s forecasted retirement date in  however during his testimony gravitt acknowledged that he included in his calculations any monies that insight spent at vendors other than preferred and southside including completely unrelated body tire and towing work that preferred had not previously performed for insight when questioned gravitt was unable to identify a causal link between that other work and preferred’s damages in fact gravitt conceded that his damages estimate would be greatly reduced if monies representing insight’s lawful conduct unrelated to the alleged tortious conduct were excluded we must agree  with insight that the damage model presented to the jury sought to hold insight liable for damages that had no relationship to the claims asserted by preferred further troubling is the fact that gravitt specifically acknowledged that insight did not have a contract with preferred and was free to move its business to another vendor at any time yet calculated his damages using payne’s proposed retirement date of  because “it seemed to be a reasonable time period” loss of anticipated profits is a recognized form of damages in kentucky if proven with a reasonable certainty paulines chicken villa inc v kfc corp  swd   ky  kentucky utilities co v warren ellison café  ky    swd   ky  although the “mere uncertainty as to the amount will not preclude recovery” illinois valley asphalt inc v harry berry inc  swd   ky  more than a mere estimate is required further there must be “no lack of certainty on account of being too remote conjectural and speculative” kentucky utilities co  swd at  preferred has produced no evidence and we find none in the record to indicate that insight would have stayed with preferred after key’s departure significantly the parties did not have a contract further there seems to be no dispute that insight and preferred’s business was premised upon key’s relationship with insight employees thus there is a distinct possibility if not probability that insight would have chosen to maintain its relationship with key and forsaken its business with preferred even absent any alleged wrongful conduct see b  l  corp  swd at  baptist physicians lexington inc  swd at  “patients    can and do choose from whom they will receive their medical care the patients that have been the subject of much dispute in this case did not belong to nlc and they do not belong to the physicians and baptist a fact that should not be lost on any of the parties on remand” gravitt’s expert testimony that he believed insight would continue to do business with preferred until  was based on nothing more than pure speculation and conjecture consequently his calculation of lost profit damages was unreliable and should have been excluded next insight argues that the trial court erred in allowing a preferred employee barbara hargrove to testify that while he was still employed with preferred key gave her  to obtain two  gift cards from ln credit union so that he could give one of them to “bob” hargrove stated that she assumed bob was bob mathena of insight insight contends that hargrove’s testimony was hearsay irrelevant and prejudicial we agree with insight that contrary to preferred’s argument the hearsay exception contained in kre  for a declarant’s state of mind is inapplicable key’s state of mind concerning his alleged intent to give mathena a gift card at a point in time well before he was terminated was simply not an issue in the case however we are more troubled by the fact that insight was prohibited from calling an ln representative or introducing a certified business record to establish that the bank had a maximum limit on gift cards of  hargrove’s testimony was  demonstrably false and the trial court’s prohibition of any rebuttal evidence proving such was clearly erroneous crossappeal in its crossappeal preferred first argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion to amend its complaint to add claim for a violation of the kentucky uniform trade secrets act “kutsa” krs  et seq preferred contends that in denying the motion the trial court engaged in an improper and incorrect analysis of the merits of the claim when it ruled that “no information identified by preferred constituteed a trade secret as defined by krs ” we disagree cr  provides that with exceptions not applicable here “a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires” see also nichols v zurich american ins co  swd  ky  in kenney v hanger prosthetics  orthotics inc  swd  – ky app  a panel of this court explained in determining whether to grant a motion to amend a partys complaint a circuit court “may consider such factors as the failure to cure deficiencies by amendment or the futility of the amendment itself” first national bank of cincinnati v hartman  swd   kyapp  other factors include whether amendment would prejudice the opposing party or would work an injustice see shah v american synthetic rubber corp  swd   ky   a trial court may deny the right to amend a pleading on the basis of “the futility of the amendment itself” which essentially equates to a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted bank one kentucky na v murphy  swd  ky  ultimately a trial court is vested with the discretion to determine whether to allow an amended pleading and its decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion lambert v franklin real estate co  swd   ky app  krs  the statute wherein kentucky codified the uniform trade secrets act provides in relevant part  “trade secret” means information including a formula pattern compilation program data device method technique or process that a derives independent economic value actual or potential from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and b is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy information cannot constitute a trade secret and thus is not confidential if the subject matter is “of public knowledge or general knowledge in the industry” or if the matter consists of “ideas which are well known or easily ascertainable” heyer–jordan  associates inc v jordan  swd   tenn app  quoting hickory specialties v b  l labs inc  swd  – tenn app   we agree with the trial court that there is simply nothing in the record to satisfy the statutory definition of a trade secret in its tendered amended complaint preferred alleged that key acquired and misappropriated “certain proprietary and confidential trade secret information belonging to preferred automotive relating to its operations pricing business arrangements suppliers customers parts warranties and vehicle repair histories” as we previously concluded however it is questionable whether the information at issue is even confidential much less trade secrets preferred did not derive any “independent economic value” from its knowledge of insight’s vehicles preferred profited simply because insight chose to have its fleet maintained by preferred furthermore insight certainly had the right to share with any other vendor it chose for service the repair and maintenance histories as well as the parts and price charged for them in venture express inc v zilly  swd at  the court stated that in the absence of evidence to the contrary this court has held that the following types of information are not confidential  remembered information as to a businesss prices  the specific needs and business habits of certain customers and  an employees personality and the relationships which he has established with certain customers see also b  l corp  swd at  names of customers the prices charged for services rendered the renewal dates for customer contracts and the name of the customer contact person authorized to enter into binding contracts is not confidential simply “because it can be difficult to obtain” finally as the  pennsylvania supreme court recognized in van products co v general welding  fabricating co  ad   pa  “material sources and costs” are “something that would be learned in any productive industry    ” see also si handling systems inc v heisley  fd  rd cir  we are of the opinion that even if the factual allegations of the amended claim were taken as true preferred would not have been entitled to any relief for a violation of the kutsa because the information it alleges key to have acquired and misappropriated does not satisfy the definition of a trade secret under krs  we conclude that the trial court properly found that it would have been futile for preferred to amend its complaint and as such denied the motion accordingly preferred next argues that the trial court erred by including itself and key in the apportionment instruction specifically preferred contends that apportionment of fault is only permitted among parties in pari delicto and that it cannot share fault in the breach of fiduciary duty since the beneficiary of a fiduciary duty cannot be in pari delicto with the fiduciary who breaches the duty further preferred argues that apportionment to key was improper because insight and key were joint and severally liable pursuant to steelvest inc v scansteel service center  swd   ky  we find both of preferred’s arguments to be without merit krs  kentucky’s comparative fault statute provides in relevant part   in all tort actions including products liability actions involving fault of more than one  party to the action including thirdparty defendants and persons who have been released under subsection  of this section the court unless otherwise agreed by all parties shall instruct the jury to answer interrogatories or if there is no jury shall make findings indicating a the amount of damages each claimant would be entitled to recover if contributory fault is disregarded and b the percentage of the total fault of all the parties to each claim that is allocated to each claimant defendant thirdparty defendant and person who has been released from liability under subsection  of this section  in determining the percentages of fault the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed  the court shall determine the award of damages to each claimant in accordance with the findings subject to any reduction under subsection  of this section and shall determine and state in the judgment each partys equitable share of the obligation to each claimant in accordance with the respective percentages of fault with the adoption of comparative fault the trier of fact is required to consider the conduct of all of the parties including claimants such as preferred and to determine the percentage of total fault of those parties “fault” has been defined to include an “unreasonable failure to avoid an injury or to mitigate damages” owens corning fiberglas corp v parrish  swd at  quoting uniform comparative fault act  ula  note  at §b cum supp   preferred’s argument that apportionment can only be among parties in pari delicto is misplaced in fact the concept of pari delicto as it is applicable herein refers only to whether a joint tortfeasor is entitled to apportionment or indemnity in degener v hall contracting corp  swd  ky  the kentucky supreme court explained the circumstances in which a defendant has a right to apportion liability and when its right is to indemnity apportionment of liability arises “when two or more joint tortfeasors are guilty of concurrent negligence of substantially the same character which converges to cause the plaintiffs damages” id at  such joint tortfeasors “are said to be ‘in pari delicto’” id indemnity on the other hand “is available to one exposed to liability because of the wrongful act of another with whom heshe is not in pari delicto” id at  in either case however whether the joint tortfeasors are or are not in pari delicto has no bearing whether fault can be apportioned to a plaintiff further contrary to preferred’s argument liability among joint tortfeasors is no longer joint and several but is several only dix  associates pipeline contractors inc v key  swd  ky  thus because the liability is several as to each joint tortfeasor it is necessary to apportion a specific share of the total liability to each of them whether joined in the original complaint or by thirdparty complaint and the several liability of each joint tortfeasor with respect to the judgment is limited by the extent of hisher fault id at – degener  swd at   preferred erroneously contends that the recent decision in abbott v chesley  swd  ky  supports joint and several liability for breach of fiduciary duty in fact our supreme court specifically recognized that joint and several liability is barred in tort cases by krs  but nevertheless determined that the appellants claim was essentially contractual based upon a breach of the attorneyclient contract and further that the appellees had engaged in a joint enterprise or joint adventure for which joint and several liability is properly assessed pursuant to krs  id at  abbott has no applicability to the instant case based upon the language of krs  and the cases interpreting comparative negligence we conclude that the trial court did not err by instructing the jury to apportion fault to preferred and key both parties have appealed the award of punitive damages insight argues the punitive damages award must be vacated because there was no clear and convincing evidence that it acted with fraud oppression malice or gross negligence krs  williams v wilson  swd  ky  insight further contends that once the trial court ruled that the punitive damage award was the result of passion or prejudice it was required to vacate the award rather than arbitrarily reduce it in its crossappeal however preferred argues that the full punitive damage award should be reinstated because the trial court lacked the authority to reduce it and because the trial court erred in finding that it was the result of passion or prejudice because we are remanding this matter for a new  trial however any issues regarding the punitive damages award are necessarily rendered moot for the same reason we decline to address insight’s arguments pertaining to the closing arguments for the reasons set forth herein the judgment of the jefferson circuit court is reversed and this matter is remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion all concur brief for appellantcrossappellee brief for appelleecrossappellant culver v halliday
