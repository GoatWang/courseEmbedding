sale and distribution of our ethanol distillers grains and corn oil the ethanol plant currently operates in excess of its nameplate capacity producing approximately  million gallons of ethanol per year corn is supplied to us primarily from our members who are local agricultural producers and from purchases of corn on the open market we have engaged renewable products marketing group inc rpmg inc to market all of the ethanol and corn oil that we produce at the ethanol plant further rpmg inc markets all of the distillers grains that we produce that we do not market internally to local customers in recent years the ethanol industry in the united states has increased exports of ethanol and distillers grains in january  the chinese issued final tariffs on us distillers grains the chinese distillers grains antidumping tariffs range from  to  and the antisubsidy tariffs range from  to  in addition the chinese government increased its ethanol import tariff from  to  as of january   these tariffs have had a negative impact on market ethanol and distillers grains prices in the united states in brazil unica the brazilian sugarcane industry is lobbying the brazilian government to institute a  tariff on imported ethanol ethanol producers in brazil are seeking a  tariff to date this tariff has not been implemented however brazil is a major source of ethanol demand and a tariff

compared to the same period of  revenue from corn oil sales increased by approximately  during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  ethanol our ethanol revenue was approximately  greater during our first quarter of  compared to our first quarter of  an increase of approximately  this increase in ethanol revenue was due primarily to an increase in the average price we received per gallon of ethanol sold during our first quarter of  compared to our first quarter of  we sold approximately  fewer gallons of ethanol during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  a decrease of approximately  gallons due to a reduction in ethanol inventory during the  period management anticipates relatively stable production for the rest of our  fiscal year the average price we received for our ethanol was approximately  greater per gallon during our first quarter of  compared to our first quarter of  an increase of approximately  management attributes this increase in ethanol prices with stronger ethanol demand in the market and improved gasoline prices which both impacted ethanol demand and prices during our first quarter of  management anticipates that ethanol prices could be negatively impacted during our  fiscal year due to uncertainty regarding ethanol exports along with anticipated increases in ethanol production in the united states if we experience excess ethanol supplies it could negatively impact the market price of ethanol which could decrease our profitability distillers grains our total distillers grains revenue was approximately  less during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to decreased distillers grains prices during the  period for our first quarter of  we sold approximately  of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately  of our total distillers grains in the modifiedwet form by comparison for our first quarter of  we sold approximately  of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately  of our total distillers grains in the modifiedwet form we determine the mix between dried distillers grains and modifiedwet distillers grains we sell based on market conditions and the relative profitability of selling the different forms of distillers grains management anticipates that we will maintain the current mix between dried distillers grains and modifiedwet distillers grains going forward unless market conditions change in a way that favors one product over the other we sold a comparable number of total tons of distillers grains during both our first quarter of  and the same period of  table of contents the average price we received for our dried distillers grains was approximately  less during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  a decrease of approximately  per ton management attributes the decrease in dried distillers grains prices during the  period with uncertainty in the export market for distillers grains due to the chinese distillers grains tariffs the average price we received for our modifiedwet distillers grains on a dryequivalent basis was approximately  less for our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  a decrease of approximately  per ton management attributes this decrease in modifiedwet distillers grains prices with ample corn supplies in our local market along with additional distillers grains supply due to the chinese tariffs china has historically been the largest export market for distillers grains due to the chinese tariffs the export market for distillers grains has been significantly impacted management anticipates that distillers grains prices will remain lower during our  fiscal year unless china reduces or eliminates these tariffs corn oil our total pounds of corn oil sold increased by approximately  during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  an increase of approximately  pounds primarily due to decreased downtime for our corn oil extraction equipment management anticipates that corn oil production will continue to be variable based on the total production of ethanol at our plant and by operating efficiencies we achieve at the ethanol plant the average price we received for our corn oil was approximately  greater for our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  an increase of approximately  per pound management believes this increase in corn oil prices was primarily due to increased biodiesel demand which positively impacts corn oil prices along with soybean oil prices soybean oil is another feedstock which is used to produce biodiesel so when soybean oil prices increase it typically benefits the market price of corn oil despite the expiration of the biodiesel blenders tax credit corn oil prices have remained higher however biodiesel production may not continue at its current level especially if the biodiesel blenders credit is not renewed cost of revenues the primary raw materials we use to produce ethanol and distillers grains are corn and natural gas corn our cost of revenues relating to corn was approximately  less for our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to the net effect of higher corn consumption and decreased corn costs per bushel during the  period our average cost per bushel of corn decreased by approximately  for our first quarter of  compared to our first quarter of  management attributes the decrease in corn prices with the large corn corp harvested in the fall of  along with ample market supplies of corn pushing prices down management anticipates that corn prices will remain relatively lower into the foreseeable future as corn is plentiful with relatively stable corn demand we consumed approximately  more bushels of corn during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  management anticipates that our corn consumption will be consistent in future quarters due to our increased production capacity natural gas our cost of revenues related to natural gas increased by approximately  an increase of approximately  for our first quarter of  compared to our first quarter of  this increase was due to an increase in market natural gas prices during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  along with an increase in our natural gas usage during this period our average cost per mmbtu of natural gas during our first quarter of  was approximately  greater compared to the cost per mmbtu for our first quarter of  management attributes this increase in our average natural gas costs with increased demand in other industries during the  period management anticipates that natural gas prices will remain relatively stable however if natural gas production problems occur it could result in higher natural gas prices which could negatively impact our profitability we used approximately  more mmbtus of natural gas during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  due primarily to increased total production along with more production of dried distillers grains which requires more natural gas to produce management anticipates that our natural gas consumption will remain at current levels for the rest of our  fiscal year table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses were greater for our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  due primarily to increased wages and benefits to our employees and increased costs related to advertising to fill employment vacancies other income and expense our interest income was greater for our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to having more cash on hand during the  period our income related to our investments was higher during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to increased profits we received from our investment in guardian hankinson llc our interest expense was lower during our first quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to having less borrowings outstanding on our loans during the  period changes in financial condition for the three months ended march   current assets we had less cash on hand at march   compared to december   due primarily to cash we used during the period for distributions to our members along with deferred corn payments we had less accounts receivable at march   compared to december   due to lower ethanol values at the end of march the value of our inventory was higher at march   compared to december   due to an increase in raw material inventory on hand we also had less finished goods inventory as a result of the timing of our ethanol shipments in relation to the end of our fiscal quarter property and equipment the value of our property and equipment was less at march   compared to december   as a result of regular depreciation of our equipment offset by capital improvements we made during our  fiscal year other assets the value of our investments were lower at march   compared to december   primarily due to a reduction in the value of our investment in guardian hankinson llc as a result of distributions we received from the investment during our  fiscal year offset by income generated by our investments during that time current liabilities we had less outstanding checks in excess of bank balances at march   compared to december   due to the timing of transfers between our accounts we use our revolving loan to pay any checks which are presented for payment which exceed the cash we have available in our accounts our accounts payable was significantly lower at march   compared to december   because our corn suppliers typically seek to defer payments for corn that is delivered at the end of the year for tax purposes which increases our accounts payable at that time these deferred payments were made early in our first quarter of  we had a smaller liability associated with our derivative financial instruments at march   compared to december   due to having less unrealized losses on our forward corn purchase contracts at march   compared to december   longterm liabilities our longterm liabilities were less at march   compared to december   due to the other liability related to longterm pledges payable liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity are cash generated from our continuing operations and amounts we have available to draw on our revolving lines of credit management does not anticipate that we will need to raise additional debt or equity financing in the next twelve months and management believes that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to continue our operations during that time period currently we have two revolving loans which allow us to borrow funds for working capital these two revolving loans are described in greater detail below in the section entitled item   managements discussion and analysis of financial table of contents condition and results of operations  indebtedness as of march   we had  outstanding and  available to be drawn on these revolving loans after taking into account the borrowing base calculation management anticipates that this is sufficient to maintain our liquidity and continue our operations the following table shows cash flows for the three months ended march   and  three months ended march    net cash used in operating activities       net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    cash flow from operations our operating activities used more cash during the three months ended march   compared to the same period of  primarily due to cash we used for inventory purchases along with less cash we received from our investments during the  period cash flow from investing activities our investing activities used more cash during the three months ended march   compared to the same period of  due to capital expenditures being offset by insurance proceeds received during the  period cash flow from financing activities our financing activities used more cash during the three months ended march   compared to the same period of  due primarily to more cash used for distributions during the  period in addition during the  period the amount of checks we had issued in excess of our bank balances increased by nearly  which increased cash generated by our financing activities indebtedness effective may   we entered into a comprehensive credit facility with farm credit services of america pca and farm credit services of america flca collectively fcsa our fcsa credit facility replaced our prior loans with first national bank of omaha our fcsa credit facility was originally comprised of a  million revolving operating line of credit the operating line and a  million revolving term commitment the term revolver our fcsa credit facility was amended in december  to add an additional  million term loan the term loan we amended our fcsa loans on november   the primary purpose of which was to replace our  million term revolver and our  million term loan with a new  million reducing revolving loan the reducing revolving loan all of our assets including the ethanol plant and equipment its accounts receivable and inventory serve as collateral for our loans with fcsa operating line the operating lines term was extended in our october   amendment to november   the total amount that we can draw on the operating line is restricted by a formula based on the amount of inventory receivables and equity we have in certain cbot futures positions interest on the operating line accrued at the one month london interbank offered rate libor plus  basis points there is a fee of  on the portion of the operating line that we are not using which is billed quarterly the interest rate for this loan at march   was  as of march   we had  outstanding on the operating line and  available to be drawn taking into account the borrowing base calculation reducing revolving loan on november   we executed a loan amendment with fcsa which eliminated our prior term loan and term revolver and replaced them with a new  million reducing revolving loan interest accrues on the reducing revolving loan at a rate of  basis points in excess of the onemonth libor and we agreed to pay a fee of  for any unused amount of the reducing revolving loan the amount we can borrow on the reducing revolving loan decreases by  semiannually starting on april   until the maximum balance reaches  million on october   the reducing revolving loan matures on october   the interest rate for this loan at march   was  as of march   we had  outstanding on the reducing revolving loan and  available to be drawn table of contents covenants our credit facilities with fcsa are subject to various loan covenants if we fail to comply with these loan covenants fcsa can declare us to be in default of our loans the material loan covenants applicable to our credit facilities are our working capital covenant local net worth covenant and our debt service coverage ratio we are required to maintain working capital current assets minus current liabilities of at least  million we are required to

march   we were in compliance with all of our loan covenants managements current financial projections indicate that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next  months and we expect to remain in compliance thereafter management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that we will fall out of compliance with our material loan covenants in the next  months if we fail to comply with the terms of our credit agreements with fcsa and fcsa refuses to waive the noncompliance fcsa may require us to immediately repay all amounts outstanding on our loans application of critical accounting policies management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported revenues and expenses of the significant accounting policies described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we believe that the following are the most critical derivative instruments we enter into shortterm forward option and futures contracts for ethanol corn and natural gas as a means of managing exposure to changes in commodity and energy prices all of our derivatives are designated as nonhedge derivatives and accordingly are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income although the contracts are considered economic hedges of specified risks they are not designated as and accounted for as hedging instruments as part of our trading activity we use futures and option contracts offered through regulated commodity exchanges to reduce our risk and we are exposed to risk of loss in the market value of inventories to reduce that risk we generally take positions using cash and futures contracts and options unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts for corn and natural gas purchases are included as a component of cost of revenues and derivative contracts related to ethanol sales are included as a component of revenues in the accompanying financial statements the fair values of derivative contracts are presented on the accompanying balance sheet as derivative financial instruments goodwill we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired annually as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred the company performs an impairment test on goodwill the first step tests for impairment while the second step if necessary measures the impairment we perform our annual analysis on december  of each fiscal year inventory valuation inventories are generally valued using methods which approximate the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value in the valuation of inventories and purchase commitments net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation revenue recognition revenue from the production of ethanol and related products is recorded when

understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we currently expect we qualify all of our forwardlooking statements by these cautionary statements overview lake area corn processors llc is a south dakota limited liability company that owns and manages its whollyowned subsidiary dakota ethanol llc dakota ethanol llc owns and operates an ethanol plant located near wentworth south dakota that has a nameplate production capacity of  million gallons of ethanol per year lake area corn processors llc is referred to in this report as lacp the company we or us dakota ethanol llc is referred to in this report as dakota ethanol we us or the ethanol plant our revenue is derived from the sale and distribution of our ethanol distillers grains and corn oil the ethanol plant currently operates in excess of its nameplate capacity producing approximately  million gallons of ethanol per year corn is supplied to us primarily from our members who are local agricultural producers and from purchases of corn on the open market we have engaged renewable products marketing group inc rpmg inc to market all of the ethanol and corn oil that we produce at the ethanol plant further rpmg inc markets all of the distillers grains that we produce that we do not market internally to local customers we are in the process of expanding our railroad siding to accommodate shipping unit trains we anticipate this project will be completed during our third quarter of  we are using cash from our continuing operations and amounts we have available to borrow on our longterm revolving debt to finance this capital project which is expected to cost approximately  million results of operations comparison of the fiscal quarters ended june   and  the following table shows the results of our operations and the percentage of revenues cost of revenues operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal quarters ended june   and  table of contents   income statement data amount  amount  revenues       cost of revenues     gross profit     operating expense     income from operations     other income     net income       revenues revenue from ethanol sales decreased by approximately  during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  revenue from distillers grains sales decreased by approximately  during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  revenue from corn oil sales decreased by approximately  during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  ethanol our ethanol revenue was approximately  less during our second quarter of  compared to our second quarter of  a decrease of approximately  this decrease in ethanol revenue was due to a decrease in the total gallons of ethanol we sold during our second quarter of  compared to our second quarter of  along with a lower average ethanol price we received per gallon of ethanol sold during the  period we sold approximately  fewer gallons of ethanol during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  a decrease of approximately  gallons due to decreased throughput at the ethanol plant management anticipates improved production for the rest of our  fiscal year provided operating margins in the ethanol industry remain positive the average price we received for our ethanol was approximately  less per gallon during our second quarter of  compared to our second quarter of  a decrease of approximately  management attributes this decrease in ethanol prices with excess ethanol supply in the market and lower gasoline prices which both impacted ethanol demand and prices during our second quarter of  in addition management believes the price of ethanol was negatively impacted by the united states environmental protection agencys epa renewable volume obligations under the federal renewable fuels standard rfs which were finalized in november  along with the proposed reduction in the renewable volume obligations for  which were released in may  these renewable volume obligations were set by the epa lower than the statutory requirements in the rfs distillers grains our total distillers grains revenue was approximately  less during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to decreased total tons of distillers grains we sold for our second quarter of  we sold approximately  of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately  of our total distillers grains in the modifiedwet form by comparison for our second quarter of  we sold approximately  of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately  of our total distillers grains in the modifiedwet form we determine the mix between dried distillers grains and modifiedwet distillers grains we sell based on market conditions and the relative profitability of selling the different forms of distillers grains we consume additional natural gas when we produce dried distillers grains as compared to modifiedwet distillers grains which can impact the profit we generate from sales of dried distillers grains management anticipates that we will maintain the current mix between dried distillers grains and modifiedwet distillers grains going forward unless market conditions change in a way that favors one product over the other the average price we received for our dried distillers grains was approximately  less during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  a decrease of approximately  per ton management attributes the decrease in dried distillers grains prices during the  period with uncertainty in the export market for distillers grains due to the chinese table of contents antidumping and countervailing duty investigation the average price we received for our modifiedwet distillers grains on a dryequivalent basis was approximately  less for our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  a decrease of approximately  per ton management attributes this decrease in modifiedwet distillers grains prices with ample corn supplies in our local market along with additional distillers grains supply due to the chinese antidumping and countervailing duty investigation however the local market prices did not decrease as much as the export market which resulted in a smaller decrease in our modifiedwet distillers grains prices china instituted an antisubsidy and countervailing duty investigation in january  which essentially closed the chinese market to united states produced distillers grains since that time the chinese have sporadically taken distillers grains exports but at a lower level than in the past management believes this has resulted in decreased worldwide demand for distillers grains which has negatively impacted domestic distillers grains prices while we do not export a significant amount of distillers grains the chinese investigation has increased the domestic supply of distillers grains which has impacted local prices in addition there are ample corn supplies in the united states which has also impacted demand for distillers grains management expects distillers grains prices to continue to trade relative to the value of corn corn oil our total pounds of corn oil sold decreased by approximately  during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  a decrease of approximately  pounds primarily due to increased downtime for our corn oil extraction equipment and less total production at the ethanol plant management anticipates that corn oil production will return to more normal levels in the future and will continue to be variable based on the total production of ethanol at our plant and by operating efficiencies we achieve at the ethanol plant the average price we received for our corn oil was approximately  greater for our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  an increase of approximately  per pound management believes this increase in market corn oil prices was primarily due to increased biodiesel demand which positively impacts corn oil prices corn oil can be used as a feedstock to produce biodiesel the biodiesel blenders tax credit was renewed at the end of december  which management believes will positively impact corn oil demand during  however the tax credit is scheduled to expire again at the end of december  as a result this increase in corn oil demand may not continue past our  fiscal year cost of revenues our cost of revenues for our second quarter of  was slightly lower compared to the same period of  due primarily to decreased corn and natural gas consumption along with lower natural gas prices the decrease in our corn consumption was due in part to decreased total production during the  period along with greater efficiency in converting corn into ethanol during the  period our cost of revenues relating to corn was approximately  less for our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to lower corn consumption partially offset by increased average corn prices during the  period our average cost per bushel of corn increased slightly for our second quarter of  compared to our second quarter of  management attributes the increase in corn prices with increased market corn prices management anticipates that corn prices will remain relatively lower into the foreseeable future as corn is plentiful with relatively stable corn demand we consumed approximately  fewer bushels of corn during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to decreased total production at the plant during  and increased efficiency at the plant which increased the number of gallons of ethanol we produced per bushel of corn ground management anticipates that our corn consumption will be slightly higher during our  fiscal year compared to our  fiscal year due to increased plant production capacity our cost of revenues related to natural gas decreased by approximately  a decrease of approximately  for our second quarter of  compared to our second quarter of  this decrease was due to a decrease in market natural gas prices during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  along with a decrease in our natural gas usage during the  period our average cost per mmbtu of natural gas during our second quarter of  was approximately  lower compared to the price for our second quarter of  management attributes this decrease in our average natural gas costs with generally lower energy prices and ample supplies of natural gas in the market management anticipates that natural gas prices will remain relatively stable however if natural gas production problems occur during  it could result in higher natural gas prices which could negatively impact our profitability we used approximately  fewer mmbtus of natural gas during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due primarily to decreased total production management anticipates that our natural gas consumption will remain at current levels due to the energy efficiency projects we completed during our  fiscal year operating expenses table of contents our operating expenses were less for our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to the net effect of increased environmental costs and decreased rail car demurrage public relations professional fees and insurance costs other income and expense our interest income was greater for our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to having more cash on hand during the  period we received a business interruption insurance payment during the  period which we included in our other income related to storm damage at the plant our income related to our investments was less during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to reduced profitability in the ethanol industry which impacts our portion of the net income generated by our investments including guardian hankinson llc and rpmg because both are involved in the ethanol industry our interest expense was lower during our second quarter of  compared to the same period of  due to having less borrowings outstanding on our loans during the  period comparison of the six months ended june   and  the following table shows the results of our operations and the percentage of revenues cost
