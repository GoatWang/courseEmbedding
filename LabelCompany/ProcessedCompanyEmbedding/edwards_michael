theology of jonathan edwards is the most comprehensive survey of his theology yet produced and the first study to make full use of the recentlycompleted seventythreevolume online edition of the works of jonathan edwards the books fortyfive chapters examine all major aspects of edwardss thought and include indepth discussions of the extensive secondary literature on edwards as well as edwardss own writings its opening chapters set out edwardss historical and personal theological contexts the next thirty chapters connect edwardss theological loci in the temporallyordered way in which he conceptualized the theological enterprisebeginning with the triune god in eternity with his angels to the history of redemption as an expression of gods inner reality ad extra and then back to god in eschatological glory the authors analyze such themes as aesthetics metaphysics typology history of redemption revival and true virtue they also take up such rarelyexplored topics as edwardss missiology treatment of heaven and angels sacramental thought public theology and views of nonchristian religions running throughout the volume are what the authors identify as five basic theological constituents trinitarian communication creaturely participation necessitarian dispositionalism divine priority and harmonious constitutionalism later chapters trace his influence on and connections with later theologies and philosophies in america and europe the result is a multilayered analysis that treats edwards as a theologian for the twentyfirstcentury global christian community and a bridge between the christian west and east protestantism and catholicism conservatism and liberalism and charismatic and noncharismatic churches author bio▼▲ michael j mcclymond is associate professor

rheumatic fever which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail with a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized he presented the idea to dr albert starr a young surgeon at the university of oregon medical school who thought the idea was too complex instead starr encouraged edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve for which there was an immediate need after just two years the first starredwards mitral valve was designed developed tested and successfully placed in a patient newspapers

million patients worldwide each year more than  valve replacements are performed worldwide through openheart surgery utilizing either bioprosthetic tissue valves or mechanical valves edwards products include tissue replacement heart valves sold under such brand names as carpentieredwards perimount and carpentieredwards perimount magna and also valve repair products that are used by surgeons to fix instead of replace a patient’s valve the edwards sapien family of heart valves are delivered via a procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr this procedure enables the placement of a collapsible heart valve into the body via a tubebased delivery system catheter that can be inserted through multiple access routes including either an incision in the leg transfemoral or in between the ribs and to be threaded up to the heart transapical or through the front of the chest and then through a small hole in the aorta transaortic the valve is designed to replace a patient’s diseased native aortic valve without traditional openheart surgery and while the heart continues to beat – avoiding the need to stop the patient’s heart and connect them to a heartlung machine that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and the patient’s breathing during surgery cardiopulmonary bypass edwards also manufactures products for vascular therapy along with hemodynamic monitoring devices for measuring cardiovascular performance during surgery and in the icu hemodynamic monitoring is the measurement of blood circulation and cardiac function that allows clinicians to evaluate whether enough oxygen is being delivered to the organs and tissues among these is the swanganz catheter originally developed for patients with acute myocardial infarction it is now used in anesthesia and critical care units healthcare providers use this monitoring to detect changes or problems in a patient’s health which allows for more informed immediate treatment decisions to facilitate onpump cardiac surgery procedures through smaller incisions edwards also offers a cardiac surgery product line comprising soft tissue retractors venous and arterial cannulae aortic occlusion venting and

edwards lifesciences’ roots date to  when miles “lowell” edwards set out to build the first artificial heart edwards was a yearold recently retired engineer holding  patents in an array of industries with an entrepreneurial spirit and a dream of helping patients with heart disease his fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens when he suffered two bouts of a disease called rheumatic fever which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail with a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized he presented the idea to dr albert starr a young surgeon at the university of oregon medical school who thought the idea was too complex instead starr encouraged edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve for which there was an immediate need after just two years the first starredwards mitral valve was designed developed tested and successfully placed in a patient newspapers around the world reported on what they termed a “miraculous” heart surgery this innovation spawned a company edwards laboratories which set up shop in santa ana california – not far from where edwards
