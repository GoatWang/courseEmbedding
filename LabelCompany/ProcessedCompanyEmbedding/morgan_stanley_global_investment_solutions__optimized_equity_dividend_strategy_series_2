credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between

morningstar calculates a morningstar rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure against other funds in the same category this measure takes into account variations

longterm investing approach has historically resulted in a lower than average portfolio turnover ratio results hypothetical k investment investing in the fund what are the risks all investments involve risks including possible loss of principal special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and can reduce returns because the fund may invest its assets in companies in a specific region including europe it is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that region andor the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically current political and financial uncertainty surrounding the european union may increase market volatility and the economic risk of investing in companies in europe derivatives including currency management strategies involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses as well as enable gains on an amount that exceeds the funds initial investment the fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as
