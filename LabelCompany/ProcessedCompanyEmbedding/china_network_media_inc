for the six months ended june   and  respectively these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern management plans to fund continuing operations through new financing from related parties and equity financing arrangements the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations to obtain additional financing as may be required until  when it can generate sources of recurring revenues and to ultimately attain profitability the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   the principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments loans from shareholders as well as the cash flows generated from our

cash on hand deposits in banks with maturities of three months or less and all highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use and which have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase   the company believes that the receivables due from related parties will be collected in near future therefore the cash and cash equivalents combined with proceeds that it expects to generate from operating activities are sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs commitments and capital expenditures over the next twelve months it may however require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions and other future developments or changes in general economic conditions     f        note       variable interest entities   to

through either arbitration or litigation in the prc they would be interpreted in accordance with prc law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with prc legal procedures the legal environment in the prc is not as developed as in other jurisdictions such as the united states as a result uncertainties in the prc legal system could further limit the company’s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements furthermore these contracts may not be enforceable in china if prc government authorities or courts take a view that such contracts contravene prc laws and regulations or are otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons in the event the company is unable to enforce these contractual arrangements it may not be able to exert effective control over the vies and

liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ from those estimates significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of longlived assets   d    cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents

year of disposition for the difference between the net book value and proceeds received thereon  maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the expected useful lives of the assets are charged to expenses as incurred   f       impairment of longlived assets   longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value there were no impairment losses for the three and six months ended june   and  respectively   g     revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  revenues are recognized when the four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the service has been rendered iii the fees are fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured the recognition of revenue involves certain management judgments the amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates   online membership revenue   online membership revenue includes revenue from members for brand advertising services as well as others services   f         the company has the arrangements with nonrefundable upfront fees model “the model” to recognize revenue for the online membership business we apply the model where a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for our services to be provided for a period of time as a membership enrollment for a majority of our online

influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party   i       earnings loss per share   basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for all periods diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding increased by common stock equivalents common stock equivalents represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants however potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted loss per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be antidilutive such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded   f         j       foreign currency transactions and translations   an entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment

asc subtopic  fair value measurements for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability   asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   ¨ level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   ¨ level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments   ¨ level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value   there were no transfers between level  level  or level  measurements for the three months ended june   and  respectively   as of june   the company used level  to measure the fair value of the shares that the company issued to employees and parttime consultants for the service rendered as the company’s shares were still not active on otcbb no quoted price for those shares    the carrying values of the company’s financial assets and liabilities including accounts receivables other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable their stated interest rate approximates current rates available   l       sharebased compensation   pursuant to asc topic  compensation  stock compensation  the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of stockbased compensation based on the grantdate fair value of the award the cost is recognized over the requisite service period except for awards granted to employees for past services which are fully expensed by the grant date   f         m     recently adopted

statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company currently has limited revenue and has accumulated deficit of  and  as of june   and december   and net income of  and  for the six months ended june   and  respectively these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern management plans to fund continuing operations through new financing from related parties and equity financing arrangements the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations to obtain additional financing as may be required until  when it can generate sources of recurring revenues and to ultimately attain profitability the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   liquidity and capital resources   our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments loans from shareholders as well as the cash flows generated from our operations   as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand deposits in banks with maturities of three months or less and all highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use and which have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase   the company believes that the receivables due from related parties will be collected in near future therefore the cash and cash equivalents combined with proceeds that it expects to generate from operating activities are sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs commitments and capital expenditures over the next twelve months it may however require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions and other future developments or changes in general economic conditions   cash generating ability   we believe that we will generate cash flows from our membership business and other business which along with our available cash will provide sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility   our cash flows were summarized below       six months ended june                    unaudited     unaudited   net cash used in operating activities           net cash used

by financing activities was nil   critical accounting policies and management estimates   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the consolidation revenue recognition income taxes and uncertain tax positions computation of net loss per share determination of net accounts receivable and determination of functional currencies represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its whollyowned subsidiaries and vies upon consolidation all balances and transactions between the company and its subsidiaries and vies have been eliminated   use of estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ from those estimates significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of longlived assets           revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  revenues are recognized when the four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the service has been rendered iii the fees are fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured the recognition of revenue involves certain management judgments the amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates   online membership revenue   online membership revenue includes revenue from members for brand advertising services as well as others services   the company has the arrangements with nonrefundable upfront fees model “the model” to recognize revenue for the online membership business we apply the model where a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for our services to be provided for a period of time as a membership enrollment for a majority of our online membership revenue revenue is recognized ratably over the membership periods on a straight line basis unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed whichever is longer we provide advertisement placements to our advertising customers on our different website channels and in different formats which can include among other things banners links logos buttons rich media preroll and postroll video screens pause video screens and content integration as specified in the contracts with the members the members can choose various on line services from the membership contracts based on their yearly membership   the company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met    others revenues   other revenues are primarily generated from online advertisement planning services which introduce our customer’s profile product and awareness promotion for their executive officers to build a better brand name for nonmember companies we follow the guidance of the securities and exchange commission’s fasb accounting standards codification no  for revenue recognition for others revenues the company recognize others revenue when they are realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement that the services have been rendered to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable the services are rendered and collectability is reasonably assured    income taxes and uncertain tax positions   income taxes   the company follows asc  income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   the company adopted asc  which provides criteria for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution our estimated liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities changes andor developments with respect to tax audits and expiration of the statute of limitations the outcome for a particular audit cannot be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit and in some cases appeal or litigation process the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from our estimates as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements additionally in future periods changes in facts circumstances and new information may require us to adjust the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recognized in the period in which the changes occur the company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to an uncertain tax position if and when required as part of income tax expense in the combined statements of operations the company did not recognize any additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the implementation of asc           property and equipment   property and equipment mainly comprise computer equipment hardware and office furniture property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value   depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets   office and other equipment  years     computers  years   depreciation expense is allocated among research and development expenses selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses   when office equipment and electronic devices are retired or otherwise disposed of resulting gain or loss is included in net income or loss in the year of disposition for the difference between the net book value and proceeds received thereon  maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the expected useful lives of the assets are charged to expenses as incurred   foreign currency transactions and translations   an entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash management’s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators such as cash flows sales price and market expenses financing and intercompany transactions and arrangements the reporting currency of the company is u s dollars “us dollars” or “” and the functional currency of hk science  technology is hong kong dollars “hk dollar”  the functional currency of the company’s prc subsidiary and vies is the renminbi “rmb’ and prc is the primary economic environment in which the company operates the reporting currency of these consolidated financial statements is the us dollars   for financial reporting purposes the financial statements of the company’s prc subsidiary and vies which are prepared using the rmb are translated into the company’s reporting currency the u s dollars the financial statements of hk science  technology which are prepared using the hk dollar are translated into the company’s reporting currency the u s dollars assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date  revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in owners’ equity   transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions  the resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income loss of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods   the exchange rates used for foreign currency translation were as follows       june       december     us  rmb balance sheet items except for equity accounts               us  hkd balance sheet items except for equity accounts                              six months ended june                us  rmb items in the statements of operations and comprehensive incomeloss and statements of cash flows               us  hkd items in the statements of operation and comprehensive incomeloss and statements of cash flows                 no representation is made that the rmb amounts could have been or could be converted into us dollars at the rates used in translation   translations adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholder’s equity were  at june   and  at december   respectively   offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements   as of june   and december   we had lease agreements for the principal offices with commitment amount of  and  respectively the unpaid contract amount is expected to be paid in one year we have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of third parties we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder’s equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements furthermore we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit liquidity or market risk support to such entity we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit support to us or that engages in leasing hedging or

linkedin gplus youtube our thinking macroeconomic insights china in transition the rise of chinas new consumer class across asia rising incomes are creating an enormous new class of consumers much of that growth is coming from china whose working population is larger than those of the us and europe combined as more chinese consumers gain purchasing power their needs and preferences will have a powerful effect on the global economy  more  more who are they 主流消费者 today’s china consumer market is dominated by a relatively narrow middle class less than  of workers earn enough even to pay income tax so what the world has seen so far is only a preview of the opportunities to come of china’s population can be considered middle class of earners pay income tax working population china  million united states  million source  figures from china nbs cnpolitics goldman sachs global investment research us bureau of labor statistics us department of defense four tiers of consumers the “average chinese consumer” does not exist china’s consumers can be divided into four tiers future growth will come from two key groups—the whitecollar “urban middle” and the bluecollar “urban mass” next movers  shakers china’s wealthiest citizens already make up a large part of global demand for highend goods their spending patterns will continue to influence trends as the country grows population  million annual income per capita us  urban middle this is china’s narrow middle class nearly half of them are on the public payroll so policies to increase income will have a strong effect here population  million annual income per capita us  urban mass this group—bluecollar workers and migrant workers who have moved to cities to find betterpaying jobs—is expected to see the biggest rise in income this will allow them to broaden their spending beyond consumer staples population  million annual income per capita us  rural workers half of china’s workers still live in rural areas with lower incomes and fewer available jobs their spending is concentrated on essentials such as food and housing population  million annual income per capita us  source china nbs cnpolitics goldman sachs global

affordability will still be an issue especially for the urban mass average daily spending china  united states  source goldman sachs global investment research seven consumer desires chinese consumer spending can be broken down into seven categories the seven key consumer desires looking more beautiful eating better better home more mobilityconnectivity having more fun wellbeinghealtheducation luxury a look ahead comparing china’s consumption patterns with those of the us shows how as incomes rise spending will shift from necessities to discretionary items expenditures across key spending categories nearly half of consumers’ incomes goes to clothes and food “fun” has the largest potential for growth source euromonitor ceic goldman sachs global investment research what do they want fun 乐 spending on recreational activities—including travel dining out sports and gaming—is much lower in china than it is in other countries that gap means that as incomes rise this category could see the biggest growth  of personal spending on fun  china  united states  source euromonitor ceic goldman sachs global investment research dining out cost is key most food spending is for meals eaten at home for the young urban mass who eat out affordability is a prime consideration according to a  peking university survey percentage of survey respondents more than half of the young urban mass spends less than day on  meals money spent per day on three meals by young urban mass when dining out rmb per day us  rmb  exchange rate current as of july   source peking university goldman sachs global investment research travel already growing although approximately only  of chinese have passports travel is booming but affordability is still an issue the urban middle takes more trips abroad while the urban mass stays closer to home trips by chinese citizens in  and  millions source ceic what do they want technology  media  the perpetually falling costs of electronics combined with the growth of “fun” activities such as movies and online gaming are fueling significant growth opportunities in technology and media explosive growth x growth of china’s theatrical movie business relative to its gross domestic product source goldman sachs global investment research state administration of press publication radio film and television china gaming is big movies are growing low costs have made online games the biggest component of media spending but movies are showing rapid growth as affordability improves china media sales by value  source iresearch goldman sachs global investment research

want ecommerce  brickandmortar commerce in china is still relatively underdeveloped and low car ownership limits shoppers’ mobility but with widely available mobile internet low shipping costs and a flood of cheap unbranded products sold online conditions are right for ecommerce to take off cost of unbranded jeans online  per pair source taobao the growth has begun china’s explosive growth in
