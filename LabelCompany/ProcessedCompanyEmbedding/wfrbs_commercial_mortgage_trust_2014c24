financial as of start and end dates reported in the loan periodic file the dscr information was provided to the certificate administrator by the master servicer and the certificate administrator has not independently confirmed the accuracy of such information the scheduled balance totals reflect the aggregate balances of all pooled loans as reported in the crefc loan periodic update file to the extent that the scheduled balance total figure for the “state” and “property” stratification tables is not equal to the sum of the scheduled balance figures for each state or property the difference is explained by loans that have been modified into a split loan structure the “state” and “property” stratification tables do not include the balance of the subordinate note sometimes called the bpiece or a “hope note” of a loan that has been modified into a splitloan structure rather the scheduled balance for each state or property only reflects the balance of the senior note sometimes
