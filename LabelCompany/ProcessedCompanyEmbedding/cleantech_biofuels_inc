about us about cleantech biofuels management board of directors investor relations letter from ceo sec filings notice of annual meeting biomass recovery process energy production biomass gasification waste partners waste partners information request library industry links news releases brochure energy production solving energy problems with municipal solid waste current uses our cellulosic feedstock can be used in many currently available technologies to produce steam electricity gas and other forms of power longterm we believe that the optimal use for our cellulosic feedstock is for the production of biofuels  our technology is a necessary component for the biofuel industry to develop and meet the goals set by the united states congress for biofuel production  cleantech enables emerging biofuel technologies to lock into longterm feedstock supplies at costeffective prices a necessary component for obtaining the financing needed to build plants using these new technologies  the cleantech biomass recovery process enables companies to acquire a clean homogeneous feedstock for energy production at extremely low costs and in some cases at no cost our technology buffers the biofuel industry against the risk of increases in the costs of its feedstock and provides a platform for financing the construction of new technologies that is not available with other cellulosic feedstocks energy production gasification biofuels propelled by rising fuel costs and federal subsidies more than  ethanol plants were built in recent years giving corn farmers and biofuelplantoperators dreams of solving america’s energy problems  but the biofuel industry has awakened to the realities of market economics environmental concerns and indirect land use calculations that make reliable ethanol profits elusive for those relying on commoditybased feedstocks  today a number of ethanol plants are being idled some construction is on hold and many bankruptcies are being filed  volatility in the prices of corn ethanol and crude oil have led many to believe that cornbased ethanol and similar biofuels produced from commodities will never be the base for a sustainable biofuel industry energy independence and security act key provisions increases the renewable fuel standard rfs to  billion gallons in  requires that by  the rfs target must be met with advanced biofuels or cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels derived from feedstock other than corn starch promotes expanding the use of biodiesel and biogas as motor fuels by providing grants for rd commercial applications of cellulosic biofuels technologies and for the conversion of existing cornbased ethanol plants to produce cellulosic biofuels authorizes  million in grants for biofuels research development and demonstration and commercial applications in states that have low rates of ethanol production directs doe to create grant programs that help establish or convert infrastructure to use renewable fuel recognizing this in  the united states congress passed the energy independence and security act with a goal for biofuel production to jump fivefold to  billion gallons by  with only  billion gallons coming from cornbased ethanol  ethanol production capacity from corn and other agricultural products was projected to increase to  billion gallons per year in  leaving little room for future growth in that industry  congress and the leaders of american industry recognize that in order for america to meet its goals for biofuel production it must turn to cellulosic feedstocks  as a result there are a number of technologies currently in development that enable companies to take the cellulosic part of a plant the part humans cannot digest and convert that into liquid transportation fuel  the technologies fall into three broad categories enzymatic processes using biological agents chemical processes combining heat and acid and thermo chemical burning cellulose in oxygen free or limited oxygen environments  significant investments are currently being made in various iterations of these technologies  there are currently at least fifty different companies that have constructed pilot or precommercial plants demonstrating technologies that convert cellulosic feedstocks into biofuels the challenges facing this industry are not scientific the technologies work the challenges are economic and environmental much like the corn ethanol industry companies that intend to produce biofuels from cellulosic material are looking for consistent supplies of feedstock at predictable prices  commercial plants currently under construction are typically using wood and wood waste as the feedstock for production  companies like range fuels have located in georgia because of the availability of large amounts of this material  however transportation and processing costs for wood make it an expensive feedstock for biofuel production regardless of the base commodity price and for many conversion technologies wood chips contain too much water and are difficult to dry other feedstocks with potential to support the cellulosic biofuel industry include crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus or crop residues like corn stover and sugar cane bagasse crops such as switchgrass are seen by many as a means to attain goals set by congress because these crops have very positive benefits for soil health and erosion control and they can be grown using considerably less water and nitrogen than traditional crops however energy crops also face challenges production harvesting handling storage and hauling costs are simply too high for companies with conversion technologies to make a profit  using agricultural wastes as feedstock also faces obstacles logistical challenges in collecting and transporting these materials add costs to these otherwise inexpensive feedstocks the collection and distribution of corn stover illustrates the challenge stover is one of the most widely available biomass materials and often viewed as the primary feedstock for many initial cellulosic ethanol plants current techniques for collecting corn stover rely on multiple passes over the field producers first harvest the corn and then collect the stover during a second pass during which the material often gets seriously contaminated with soil to reduce harvesting costs several groups are working on single pass harvesters a machine that simultaneously collects the grain and the stover however this technology is not yet available to farmers feedstock markets are not yet available and need to develop before farmers invest in new equipment and systems to harvest agricultural residuals or grow energy crops industrywide there is a chicken and egg problem with the construction of new cellulosic biofuel plants financing for a large biorefinery is extremely difficult if not impossible to obtain without a guaranteed feedstock supply at predictable prices and farmers are not willing to grow process and store feedstock until there is a biorefinery to buy it cleantech solves this problem by offering a reliable source of cellulosic feedstock at predictable prices that are significantly lower than the costs of biomass from other sources  to request more information about turning garbage into energy please contact cleantech biofuels cleantech biofuels inc

under “statement regarding forwardlooking information”   company overview   the company is in its development stage and is focused on being a provider of i cellulosic biomass derived from municipal solid waste also known as msw as a feedstock for producing energy and other chemical products and ii recyclables metals plastics glass from the msw we are the exclusive licensee in the united states and canada of patented technology which we refer to as our biomass recovery process  that cleans and separates msw and generates a clean homogeneous biomass feedstock that we believe can be converted into various energy products our license permits us to use the biomass we derive from msw to produce all energy products in addition  we own the patent for a pressurized steam classification technology originally developed by the university of alabama in huntsville that we refer to as our psc technology the psc technology is the underlying technology upon which the biomass recovery process is based prior to march  we had licensed the psc technology to bioproducts international inc “bioproducts”  however  pursuant to a settlement agreement with bioproducts in march  we had the right to use the biomass recovery process technology worldwide for any product that we desired and with no royalty due to bioproducts we terminated the license to bioproducts in march  as further described in the section entitled “intellectual property terms” the company has spent  on research and development activities during  and          we are a delaware corporation we were originally incorporated in  as long road entertainment inc and were formed to operate as a holding company for businesses in the theater motion picture and entertainment industries we ceased conducting that business in  and were dormant until the fall of  at which time our founder and then controlling stockholder decided to pursue the sale of the company in anticipation of that sale we changed our name to alternative ethanol technologies inc   on march   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization in which we agreed to acquire srs energy inc a delaware corporation that at that time was seeking to commercialize various technologies for the processing of waste materials into usable products we consummated the merger on may   resulting in srs energy becoming our whollyowned subsidiary effective august   we changed our name to cleantech biofuels inc   we have no operating history as a producer of biomass feedstocks or any energy products and have not constructed any operating plants to date we have not earned any revenues to date and our current capital and other existing resources are not sufficient to fund the implementation of our business plan or our required working capital we will require substantial additional capital to implement our business plan and we may be unable to immediately obtain the capital required to continue operating   plan of operation   our focus is to secure sufficient capital to fund our current working capital requirements and the construction of a commercial plant as described further in this section we have had an ongoing lack of liquidity and currently do not have sufficient capital to continue to fund our proposed operations and are relying on the minimal assets on hand to fund our limited operations and corporate existence all of our ongoing and proposed developmentsprojects require a significant amount of capital that we currently do not have while we continue to pursue outside sources of funding we have not had success securing meaningful amounts of outside capital in recent years as a result we can provide no assurance that we will secure any source of funding in the immediate time frame required and the failure to do so will likely result in an inability to continue operations   our company was initially conceived as a fullyintegrated producer of cellulosic ethanol from msw based on our investigation and acquisition of new technologies and research and development of our existing technologies in  we refocused our business to the commercialization of our biomass recovery process technology for cleaning and separating msw into its component parts and initiated a plan to consolidate the ownership andor rights to use intellectual property around this technology the technology is currently in commercial use in coffs harbor australia by an operator not owned by the company the “thirdparty operator” as a result we believe this technology could be implemented commercially in the united states and elsewhere in furtherance of our focus we are continuing our ongoing search for an outside source of financing that will provide the capital for us to design build and operate a commercial biomass recovery plant that will allow us to produce biomass feedstock for customer evaluation trial purchases andor be used in equipment selection for power generation and possibly combined heat and power chp initially the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities power and steam producers power and chp equipment suppliers and biofuel research firms for evaluation in addition to seeking a source of funding for plant development the company hopes to license andor develop potential commercial projects as they present themselves all of our developments plan to focus on cleaning and separating msw into its component parts in order to obtain i a homogenous feedstock of cellulosic biomass for producing energy and other chemical products and ii recyclable products metals plastics our plans may also include possibility of operating a msw transfer station where we could install our technology        biomass feedstock production   the company strives to design and build a commercial biomass recovery plant to provide biomass feedstock for customer evaluation trial purchases andor power generation initially the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities power and steam producers power and chp equipment suppliers and biofuel and chemical research firms for evaluation in addition to research and development the company also plans to license andor develop potential commercial projects   we hope to develop a plant in a major metropolitan area we are working to develop one or more locations where waste collected would be processed using our technology and the biomass produced used to create heat andor power   in addition to the developments we are currently contemplating from time to time other development opportunities are presented to us and we evaluate those potential developments if we are able to operate a plant  and thereafter refine our knowhow with respect to implementation of the technology we intend to seek to partner with waste haulers landfill owners and municipalities to implement the technology across the united states and internationally    any development of commercial plants andor implementation of the licensing of our technology described above will require significant additional capital which we currently do not have to date we have not been successful in raising the amount of capital necessary to implement our business plan and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital while we anticipate that financing for the commercial biomass recovery plant and these other potential projects could also be provided in part via tax exempt bond financing or through the use of loan guarantees from local state and federal authorities we have not secured any such financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any such financing   in october  we entered into a nonbinding memorandum of understanding “mou” with various parties combined the “parties” which memorializes the parties ’ intent for cleantech to develop and operate a msw transfer station and biomass recovery plant on land in jersey city nj not owned by cleantech all parties agree to work towards definitive agreements as soon as reasonably practicable including but not limited to an escrow agreement whereby cleantech would fund engineering and legal expenses incurred during the permitting application process an option agreement providing cleantech the right to purchase the permit applicant a lease agreement for a period of not less than  years including two  year options to extend the term of the lease to  years and noncompete agreements from the parties this mou will terminate upon the earlier of i execution of the definitive agreements ii mutual agreement between the parties and iii  pm est on june   while this mou has expired we continue to work towards a definitive agreement   on june   we entered into an acquisition agreement with  van keuren llc a new jersey limited liability company “van keuren” pursuant to which the company acquired  of the outstanding membership interests in van keuren with the former members of van keuren retaining a  interest   the new jersey sports and exposition authority has received certification of an amendment to the solid waste management plan from the new jersey department of environmental protection “dep” to include the proposed operation of a municipal solid waste transfer station and material recovery facility “tsmrf” at a site located in jersey city new jersey cleantech biofuels and van keuren intend to seek the necessary permits and approvals from the new jersey dep to build own and operate the tsmrf as part of the acquisition cleantech acquired an option to lease the property in jersey city within  days after the final permit issues from the new jersey dep the company intends to  install its biomass recovery process on the site and  operate the tsmrf   van keuren has had no operations or revenue since inception and has solely been working towards obtaining the permits required to operate the tsmrf as payment for the acquisition the company issued in the aggregate  shares of restricted common stock of the company par value  to certain holders of membership interests in van keuren as of the close of business on june   the company stock quote was  the total assets of van keuren at the time of the acquisition were   of the company ’s assets the liabilities and equity consisted of accounts payable of  and member equity of  the assets consist solely of costs incurred towards obtaining the required permits and have been recorded as an intangible asset on our consolidated financial statements this intangible will be expensed if and when the company and van keuren complete the permit process and begin operations        on december   the company entered into a nonbinding memorandum of understanding “mou” with mercer group international inc which memorializes the parties intent for cleantech to lease  acres inside of mercer groups ’ solid waste transfer station facility where cleantech intends to install its biomass recovery process technology the mou also includes a provision for mercer group to supply msw and pay a tipping fee to the cleantech operation this mou was for an initial term of  days and expired on march   the parties continue to work toward a definitive lease and supply agreement   biofuel and biochemical joint testingresearch   if we are able to process msw into biomass through our potential future biomass recovery plant andor in future commercial vessels we hope to enter into joint research agreements with companies looking to process biomass in their systems for various types of energy and chemical production we believe that this testing and research could provide possible revenue streams projects and additional opportunities for use of our biomass   in february  we entered into a confidentiality agreement and material transfer agreement with sweetwater energy inc “sweetwater” a renewable energy company with patentpending technology to produce sugars from several types of biomass for use in the biofuel biochemical and bioplastics markets we agreed and coordinated with the thirdparty operator in australia to ship  pounds of biomass produced at the thirdparty operator ’s facility to the sweetwater lab for testing the shipment arrived in may  and sweetwater has completed their initial testing in june  we entered into a confidential disclosure and sampling agreement with novozymes north america inc a developer of industrial enzymes microorganisms and biopharmaceutical ingredients for conversion into a variety of energy and chemical products in july  we supplied a sample of our biomass product for testing in their enzymatic hydrolysis process some initial testing was completed during the  rd quarter of  we expect further testing to occur for both of these companies and for possible additional companies upon securing the requisite financing to build a biomass recovery plant to process msw   new technologies  commercializing existing technologies   because of our ability to produce a clean homogenous biomass feedstock we are frequently presented with the opportunity to partner with or acquire new technologies in addition to developing our current technologies we intend to continue to add technologies to our suite of solutions that complement our core operations we believe that our current technologies and aspects of technologies in development or contemplation will enable us to eventually expand our business to use organic material from other waste streams such as municipal biosolids from waste water facilities and animal waste for fuel production   to commerc ialize our technology we anticipate we will need to     ● construct and operate a commercial plant that i processes msw into cellulosic biomass for conversion into energy or chemical products and ii separates recyclables metals plastics glass for singlestream recycling   ● identify and partner with landfill owners waste haulers and municipalities to identify locations suitable for our technology and   ● pursue additional opportunities to implement our technology in commercial settings at transfer stations and landfills in our licensed territories   our ability to implement this strategy is heavily dependent on our ability to raise significant amounts of additional capital and to hire appropriate managers and staff our success will also depend on a variety of market forces and other developments beyond our control   industry overview     there are two types of msw disposal     ● mun icipal solid waste landfills “mswlfs”  includes municipal solid waste commercial waste industrial waste construction and demolition debris and bioreactors and   ● mass burnincineration plants        municipal solid waste landfills   m swlfs primarily receive household waste and commercial waste mswlfs can also receive nonhazardous sludge industrial solid waste and construction and demolition debris all mswlfs must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations   disposing of waste in a landfill involves burying waste and this remains a common practice in most countries historically landfills were often established in disused quarries mining voids or borrow pits a properlydesigned and wellmanaged landfill can be a hygienic and relatively inexpensive method of disposing of waste materials older poorlydesigned or poorlymanaged landfills can create a number of adverse environmental impacts such as windblown litter attraction of vermin and generation of liquid leachate another common byproduct of landfills is gas mostly composed of methane and carbon dioxide which is produced as organic waste breaks down anaerobically this gas can create odor problems kill surface vegetation and contributes to global warming   waste haulers or municipalities pay tipping fees or gate rates on a per ton basis to dispose of garbage at a landfill gate rates operate in a manner similar to the published prices for airline tickets or hotels before discounts or contract prices which could be higher or lower are considered the gate rate is the true daily market value of the tipping fee   mass burnincineration plants   mass burn  mass burn is combusting msw generally without any preprocessing or separation the resulting steam is employed for industrial uses or for generating electricity mass burn facilities are sized according to the daily amount of solid waste they expect to receive most mass burn plants can remove noncombustible steel and iron for recycling before combustion using magnetic separation processes other nonferrous metals can be recovered from the leftover ash   wastetoenergy wte plants  current operating wte plants burn msw in a controlled environment to create steam or electricity through this process the volume of solid waste is reduced by about    modular incinerators  modular incinerators are small mass burn plants with a capacity of  to  tons per day the boilers for modular incinerators are built in a factory and shipped to the wte site rather than being built on the wte site itself the advantage of a modular wte incinerator is flexibility if more capacity is needed modular wte units can be added these facilities are used primarily by small communities and industrial sites costs limit the use of this technology because the return on investment in terms of energy produced over time is much lower than in mass burn plants   refusederived fuel rdf plants  rdf plants process solid waste before it is burned a typical plant will remove noncombustible items such as glass metals and other recyclable materials the remaining solid waste is then shredded into smaller pieces for burning rdf plants require significantly more sorting and handling than mass burn but can recover recyclables and remove some potentially environmentally harmful materials prior to combustion rdf can be burned in power boilers at factories or even at large housing complexes sometimes rdf materials are densified compacted at high pressure to make fuel pellets the pellet fuel may also include various sludges byproducts of municipal or industrial sewage treatment plants   msw contains a diverse mix of waste materials some benign and some very toxic effective environmental management of msw plants aims to exclude toxics from the mswfuel and to control air pollution emissions from the wte plants toxic materials include trace metals such as lead cadmium and mercury and trace organics such as dioxins and furans such toxins pose an environmental problem if they are released into the air with plant emissions or if they are dispersed in the soil and allowed to migrate into ground water supplies and work their way into the food chain the control of such toxics and air pollution are key features of environmental regulations governing msw fueled electric generation   us epa rules are among the most stringent environmental standards for wte facilities in the world these rules mandate that all facilities use the most modern air pollution control equipment available to ensure that wte smokestack emissions are as clean as possible and are safe for human health and the environment        burning any fuel including msw can produce a number of pollutants such as carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide and fine particles containing heavy metals other toxic organic compounds such as dioxins are also potential emissions from any combustive activity where certain chemical compounds are present a situation that could take place in the wte process air emission control devices in a wte facility usually include     ● dry scrubbers – these wash the air emissions from the wte process called the gas stream and remove any acidic gases by passing the gas stream through a liquid   ● electrostatic precipitators esp – these use high voltage electricity to remove up to  of all particles remaining in the gas stream after passing through the scrubbers including any heavy metal particles   ● fabric filters baghouses – these consist of a series of nearly two thousand fabric bags made of heatresistant material which filter remaining particles from the gas stream this includes any large concentrations of condensed toxic organic compounds such as dioxins and heavy metal compounds   incinerators and rdf processors are paid tipping fees for the garbage that they accept typically these fees are costlier than the fees paid to landfill operators largely because of the high capital and operating costs at combustion facilities   competition   competition in our industry will primarily come from mass burn rfd andor wte plants if we produce power and steam  all of these types of plants use msw for their feedstock   m any of these plants are operational and have been operating for years in the united states and thus have substantially more operating experience than our company  we believe our biomass recovery process may produce a cleaner more homogenous fuel for boilers and gasifiers   environmental matters   we believe our operations will be subject to international federal state and local laws and regulations with regard to air and water quality hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters upon operation there is always a risk that the federal agencies may enforce certain rules and regulations differently than state and local environmental administrators federal state and local rules and regulations are subject to change and any such changes could result in greater regulatory burdens on plant operations we could also be subject to environmental or nuisance claims from adjacent property owners or residents in the areas arising from possible foul smells noise or other air or water discharges from the plant we do not know the potential cost of these requirements or potential claims environmental laws and regulations that may affect us in the future may include but are not limited to     ● the clean air act as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions including state implementation plans related to existing and new national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter owners andor operators of air emission sources are responsible for obtaining permits and for annual compliance and reporting   ● the clean water act which requires permits for facilities that discharge wastewaters into the environment   ● the solid waste disposal act as amended by the resource conservation and recovery act which requires certain solid wastes including hazardous wastes to be managed pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory regime   ● the national environmental policy act which requires federal agencies to consider potential environmental impacts in their decisions including siting approvals   government approvals   the company is not currently subject to any government approvals or oversight for its current operations other than normal corporate governance and taxes however if we are able to begin developing commercial production facilities we will be subject to multiple federal state and local environmental laws and regulations such as those described above and for employee health and safety in addition some of these laws and regulations will require our prospective facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification a violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines natural resource damages criminal sanctions permit revocations andor facility shutdowns        our technology   we believe we can convert msw into cellulosic material using our biomass recovery process which can then be used by a variety of third party technologies as a feedstock to process that cellulosic material into a variety of energy and chemical products   biomass recovery process   msw contains valuable resources if they can be recovered economically waste haulers often bring unsorted waste by truck to material recovery facilities also known as mrfs  for sorting and removal of selected materials prior to disposal in sanitary landfills in addition certain customers of waste haulers separate recyclables prior to collection per a february  us environmental protection agency “epa” update on msw approximately  of msw was recycled or composted in     the psc technology was developed at the university of alabama in huntsville and improved by anthony noll into the technology we refer to as the biomass recovery process the process separates curbside msw into organic and inorganic materials using a patented and proprietary process that involves a unique combination of steam pressure and agitation the separation is accomplished by placing waste material in a rotating pressure vessel or autoclave in the autoclave the material is heated to several hundred degrees which sterilizes the waste material while the pressure and agitation cause a pulping action this combination is designed to result in a large volume reduction yielding the following two sterilized resource streams for further manufacturing of new products     ● cellulosic biomass a decontaminated homogeneous feedstock that we expect will repre sent approximately   to  percent of the incoming msw and will be suitable for conversion to multiple energy or chemical products and   ● separated recyclables steel cans and other ferrous materials aluminum cans plastics and glass which we expect wil l represent about  percent of the msw input and are sorted and can be sold to recyclers   the process also creates residual waste fines rocks soil textiles and nonrecyclable fractions which we expect will represent the remaining  to   percent of the msw input we do not expect to be able to recover any value in this residual waste we will be required to deliver this waste to landfills and incur the tipping fees expense    the process is currently used in a commercial plant operated by a thirdparty operator in coffs harbor australia that has been in operation for over seven years we believe that our process represents a significant improvement over other autoclave technologies currently in use because of     ● the relationship between agitation of the waste material moisture and the temperature and pressure of steam in the vessel uses less energy while obtaining a cleaner biomass resource   ● the method of introduction of steam into the autoclave vessel the pre ssure range along with the method of full depressurization and treatment of the steam being vented from the process to prevent air pollution make our process more environmentally friendly than any other means to handle msw   ● the method of mixing the heat and steam with the waste uniformly throughout the vessel creates a homogenous feedstock for fuel production and   ● the direct and critical correlation between the length and diameter of the vessel internal flighting and the total tonnage of waste to be pro cessed for proper mixing and product yield   if we are able to continue to develop our business and pursue opportunities we may incur research and development costs we incurred no costs in  and  for research and development        principal products or services and their markets   if we determine that our licensed technologies are commercially viable and we are able to raise a significant amount of additional capital we may be in a position to begin to license andor enter into longterm contracts with municipalities solid waste haulers and operators of landfills and materials recovery facilities to process a large portion of their waste streams into biomass and recyclable materials   energy chemicals   we expect the primary product we will sell will be biomass from our biomass recovery process to be used for conversion to energy or chemical products we believe our potential biomass product can be used in multiple varieties of energy production systems we expect the uses for our biomass product to potentially expand as new energy production technologies are developed   msw processing services   we believe that the opportunity to help communities haulers and landfill managers reduce the amount of material transported and deposited in landfills is la rge and growing the resource conservation and recovery act of  referred to as rcra requires landfills to install expensive liners and other equipment to control leaching toxics due to the increased costs and expertise required to manage landfills under rcra many small local landfills closed during the ’s larger regional landfills were built requiring increased transportation costs for the waste haulers as a result landfill space is increasingly scarce and disposal costs have been increasing   currently landfill operators charge a tipping fee to deliver msw to a landfill wastetoenergy facility recycling facility transfer station or similar facility tipping fees vary widely based on geographic location and the number of available places to dispose of msw in a given location because of the increasing cost pressures on waste haulers and based on current tipping fee pricing we believe we will be able to negotiate a payment of part of their tipping fee from waste haulers who deliver msw to us for processing that would range from as low as  per ton in some central parts of the country to over  per ton in the northeast and parts of the southeast the availability of tipping fees at favorable rates will be a key component of our business   recyclable byproducts   we anticipate that our biomass recovery process will generate other recyclable byproducts from the processing of msw such as aluminum metals tin steel glass and plastic typically  to  percent of the total waste stream the markets for these recovered products are volatile and subject to rapid and unpredictable market changes making it impossible at this time to provide estimated per ton cost to revenue information   sources and availability of raw materials   we believe t he emergence of technologies to convert msw to energy or chemicals is opening new opportunities what was once perhaps the greatest sanitation and health challenge for communities may eventually become an economic and environmental asset instead of adding to landfills already nearing capacity limits converting msw into biomass may provide one of the building blocks to a more sustainable energy future   american s produce more than   million tons of msw annually about  of this waste is currently recovered and recycled we estimate that approximately up to an additional  could potentially be recovered as various waste processing technologies are refined competition for this future resource will likely intensify as a result it will be important for us to attempt to secure access to as much msw as possible through longterm feedstock supply agreements with operators of materials recovery facilities and landfills        intellectual property terms   biomass north america licensing inc   on september   the company consummated the acquisition of biomass north america licensing inc  an illinois corporation “biomass” pursuant to a merger between biomass and a whollyowned subsidiary of the company with biomass as the surviving subsidiary of the company in accordance with an agreement and plan of merger by and between the company and biomass by virtue of the merger the company acquired a license agreement pursuant to which the company holds a license in the united states and canada to use the patented technology that cleans and separates msw that we refer to as the biomass recovery process which is owned by biomass north america llc the former parent of biomass the “licensor” in july  the united states patent and trademark office issued us patent number  for this process the “brp patent” the brp patent expires in june    in accordance with a november  amendment the company has an exclusive license in the united states and canada to use the biomass recovery process and includes no performance requirements on the company t he license agreement is for a term of  years from the date of the amendment or the life of any patent issued for the biomass recovery process including any amendments modifications or extensions the license requires that the company pay a royalty in the amount of  per ton of msw used in the biomass recovery process to the licensor and the company released the  shares of common stock to the licensor previously held in escrow since the merger   psc p atent   the company owns us patent no  the “psc patent” which is the underlying technology upon which the brp patent is based the company acquired the psc patent on october   pursuant to a patent purchase agreement with world waste technologies inc “wwt” the patent is the basis for the pressurized steam classification technology that cleans and separates msw into its component parts which we refer to as the psc technology the psc patent expires in november  pursuant to a master license agreement with bioproducts that the company acquired in connection with the acquisition of the psc patent the “bioproducts license agreement” bioproducts was the exclusive licensee of the psc technology but not the biomass recovery process although pursuant to a settlement agreement with bioproducts in march  the company has the right to use the biomass recovery process worldwide for any product and with no royalty due to bioproducts on september   the company sent a notice of breach to the licensee of our psc patent we received a response from the licensee on november   in february  we became aware that the licensee affected a transfer of the license in violation of the bioproducts license agreement as a result on march   we sent a notice of termination to the licensee and the transferee terminating the bioproducts license agreement on june   steve vande vegte a shareholder of the parent of bioproducts filed a lawsuit against various individuals and companies including the company the only cause of action against the company was for declaratory relief seeking to void our march  termination of the license to which mr vande vegte is not a party on august   the company filed a demurrer requesting that the court dismiss the case on the grounds that mr vande vegte lacks standing to pursue a claim concerning the license and that the claim raised in the complaint is not ripe on december   the demurrer to dismiss the company was granted in october  a crosscomplaint was filed by clean conversion technologies inc “cct” and michael failla against the company cct was seeking to void the company’s termination of the bioproducts license agreement this case was voluntarily dismissed per the filing with the court in february  additionally cct filed suit against the company and steve vande vegte alleging antitrust violations this case was voluntarily dismissed per the filing with the court in august    employees   the company currently has one fulltime employee its chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer edward p hennessey jr

ave university city mo    item a risk factors   you should carefully consider the following risk factors and ot her information contained in this annual report on form k when evaluating our business and financial condition additional risks not presently known to us and risks that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and prospects    risks related to our business   we need to obtain significant additional capital to fund our current and planned operations and complete the implementation of our business plan  and the failure to secure additional capital will prevent us from commercializing our technology and executing our plan of operation    we have a history of losses and working capital deficits we do not currently have enough cash or other liquid assets to fund our proposed business operations although to date we have been able to fund our basic corporate obligations if we are not able to obtain additional financing in the immediate future we will be required to further delay our development until such financing becomes available and may be required to cease operations in order to fund the development of our business plan we will be required to identify and execute upon some form of outside funding such as to     ● obtain additional debt or equity financing   ● secure significant government grants andor   ● enter into a strategic alliance with a larger energy or chemical company to provide funding   the amount of funding needed to complete the development and implementation of our business plan will be very substantial and may be in excess of the amount of funding we may be able to obtain we are continuing to attempt to identify the sources for additional financing that we will require but currently do not have binding commitments from any third parties to provide this financing our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to a number of factors including market conditions acceptance of our business plan the quality of our biomass and investor sentiment these factors may make the timing amount terms and conditions of additional funding unattractive for these reasons sufficient funding whether on terms acceptable to us or not may not be available if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing on a timely basis the development of our technology facilities andor products will be further delayed and we could be forced to limit or terminate our operations altogether further any additional funding that we obtain in the form of equity will reduce the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders   we have no operating experience and may not be able to implement our business plan   as a company in the development stage there is no material operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects we do not expect to commence any significant operations until we test and refine information from a commercial plant for biomass production andor develop or license an operating facility as a result we expect to sustain losses without corresponding revenues which could result in the company incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously for the foreseeable future we cannot provide any assurance that we will be profitable in any given period or at all        in addition we currently have only one fulltime employee our chief executive officer who is acting as the company’s interim chief financial officer who spends at least  hours a week on our business collectively he has less experience in operating an alternative energy company compared to many of our competitors moreover given the rapid changes in the industry we face challenges in planning and forecasting accurately our lack of expertise and resources may have a negative impact on our ability to implement our strategic plans which may result in our inability to commence meaningful operations achieve profitable operations or otherwise succeed in other aspects of our business plan   our financial statements reflect a “ going concern” qualification   because o f our lack of revenues lack of working capital and lack of any assured financing sources our financial statements raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because of our financial condition and substantial losses the opinion of our auditors for the year ended december   expressed a qualification about our ability to continue as a going concern this condition has continued since those financial statements and we expect that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future unless we are able to raise a substantial amount of additional financing in view of the matters described  our ability to continue to pursue our plan of operations as described herein is dependent upon our ability to raise the capital necessary to meet our financial requirements on a continuing basis   our biomass recovery process technology may have design and engineering issues that may increase the costs of using the technology   the biomass recovery process technology involves the use of a rotating pressure vessel or autoclave to combine heat pressure and agitation to convert msw into biomass although technologies that involve the separation and processing of msw using largescale autoclaves have not been widely adapted in commercial applications two vessels using this process are currently operating in australia we have completed a small scale research and testing vessel that initially processed msw for testing purposes   although we believe the autoclaves will operate properly on a commercial scale we may encounter design and engineering problems when we try to implement this technology on a largescale for biomass and energy production any design engineering or other issue may cause delays increase production and development costs and require us to shut down our operation   we may not have sufficient legal protection of our technologies and other proprietary rights which could result in the loss of some or all of our rights or the use of our intellectual properties by our competitors   our success depends substantially on our ability to use our owned andor licensed technologies and to keep our licenses in full force and for us and our technology licensor to maintain our patents maintain trade secrecy and not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business further we cannot be sure that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies duplicate elements of our technologies or design around them even if we are able to obtain or license patent protection for our process or products there is no guarantee that the coverage of these patents will be sufficiently broad to protect us from competitors or that we will be able to enforce our patents against potential infringers patent litigation is expensive and we may not be able to afford the costs third parties could also assert that our process or products infringe patents or other proprietary rights held by them   we also rely on trade secrets proprietary knowhow and technology that we will seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our prospective j oint venture partners employees and consultants there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others        we will be dependent on our abil ity to negotiate favorable feedstock supply and biomass offtake agreements   in addition to proving and commercializing our technology the viability of our business plan will depend on our ability to develop longterm supply relationships with municipa lities municipal waste haulers mrf operators andor landfills to provide us with the necessary waste streams on a longterm basis we also will depend on these haulers operators and facilities to take residual waste streams from our plants and to deliver or accept these streams for land filling additionally we will need to develop offtake agreements with conversion technology companies andor energy companies for the consumption of our biomass we currently have no such relationships or agreements and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any such relationships or agreements if we are unable to create these relationships and receive supply agreements andor offtake agreements on terms favorable to us  we may not be able to implement our business plan and achieve profitability   we may not be able to attract and retain management and other personnel we need to succeed   we currently have one fulltime employee our chief executive officer who is also the company’s interim chief financial officer  if we are able to implement our business plan part of our success is expected to depend on our ability to recruit senior management and other key technology development construction and operations employees especially given our lack of financial resources we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract retain and motivate such employees the inability to hire and retain one or more of these employees could cause delays or prevent us from implementing our business strategy the majority of our new hires could be engineers project managers and operations personnel there is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities if we cannot attract and retain on acceptable terms the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business we may not be able to commence operations or grow at an acceptable pace   we incur significant costs as a result of being a public company   as a p ublic company we are incurring significant legal accounting and other expenses and our corporate governance and financial reporting activities are more timeconsuming these costs and obligations divert resources from developing and furthering our business plan and operations the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission has required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies for example as a public company we are required to adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures in addition we are incurring additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements these rules and regulations could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers   the company has incu r red significant indebtedness and has various obligations to satisf y or repay that indebtedness   the company has issued various forms of debt instruments to raise capital and certain of these obligations have matured and are due the company has obligations to repay or otherwise satisfy its debt obligations this indebtedness could limit the company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness for capital raising purposes securing a line of credit or otherwise a significant portion of the company’s resources may need to be dedicated to the repayment of such indebtedness which would reduce the amount of funds available for other corporate purposes the company’s ability to meet its expected debt obligations and reduce its indebtedness will be dependent upon the company’s future performance which will be subject to the success of its business strategy general economic conditions and other factors affecting the company’s operations many of which are beyond the company’s control   our senior management ’s limited experience managing a publicly traded company diverts management’s attention from operations and could harm our business   our management team has limited experience managing a publicly traded company and complying with federal securities laws including compliance with disclosure requirements on a timely basis our management is required to design and implement appropriate p rograms and policies in response to increased legal regulatory compliance and reporting requirements and any failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and harm our business        our failure to adequately adhere to the established corporate governance practices or the failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business   compliance with the evolving corporate governance practices takes a significant amount of management time and attention particularly with regard to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting although we have reviewed our disclosure and internal controls and procedures in order to determine whether they are effective our controls and procedures may not be able to prevent errors or frauds in the future faulty judgments simple errors or mistakes or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established controls and procedures may make it difficult for us to ensure that the objectives of the control system are met a failure of our controls and procedures to detect other than inconsequential errors or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations   risks related to our industry   as a small company with minimal financial resources  we are at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors which include larger established companies that have substantially greater financial technical manufacturing marketing distribution and other resources than us   the alternative energy and waste haulinglandfill industries in the united states are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves competition is likely to continue to increase with the emergence and commercialization of new alternative energy technologies even if we are successful in implementing our business plan we may not be able to compete within these industries moreover the success of alternative energy generation technologies may cause larger conventional energy companies with substantial financial resources to enter the alternative energy industry these companies due to their greater capital resources and substantial technical expertise may be better positioned to develop and exploit new technologies our inability to respond effectively to our competition could result in our inability to commence meaningful operations achieve profitable operations or otherwise succeed in other aspects of our business plan   our success may be dependent on continued high energy prices   prices for energy can vary significantly over time and decreases in price levels could adversely affect our profitability and viability worldwide energy prices are subject to a myriad of factors almost all of which are completely beyond our ability to control frequently unforeseen events can have a dramatic impact on the price paid for energy if the prices for more traditional sources of energy remain relatively low such a pricing environment could cause our business model to be unviable and our technology worthless   waste processing and energy production is subject to inherent operational accidents and disasters from which we may not be able to recover especially if we have only one or a very small number of facilities   our anticipated operations would be subject to significant interruption if any of our p otential facilities experience a major accident or are damaged by severe weather or other natural disasters in particular processing waste and producing energy products is subject to various inherent operational hazards such as equipment failures fires explosions abnormal pressures blowouts transportation accidents and natural disasters some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties currently we do not have any insurance to cover those risks we intend to seek insurance appropriate for our business before we commence significant operations the insurance that we plan to obtain if obtained may not be adequate to cover fully the potential operational hazards described above   alternative technologies could make our business obsolete   even if our technology proves to be commercially feasible there is extensive research and development being conducted in alternative energy sources technological developments in any of a large number of competing processes and technologies could make our technology obsolete and we have little ability to manage that risk        risks related to governm ent regulation   enforcement of energy policy regulations could change   energy policy in the united states is subject to ongoing change over the last few decades the united states congress has passed separate major pieces of legislation addressing energy policy and related regulations we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be a very important legislative priority on a national state and local level as energy policy continues to evolve the existing rules and regulations that benefit our industry may change it is difficult if not impossible to predict changes in energy policy that could occur on a federal state or local level in the future the elimination of or a change in any of the current rules and regulations could create a regulatory environment that prevents us from developing a commercially viable or profitable business   costs of compliance may increase with changing environmental and operational safety regulations   as we implement our business plan we will become subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air water and ground the generation storage handling use transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees in addition some of these laws and regulations require our contemplated facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification these laws regulations and permits can often require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment a violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines natural resource damages criminal sanctions permit revocations andor facility shutdowns   furtherm ore we may become liable for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at any property that we would own or operate and at offsite locations where we may arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances if these substances have been or are disposed of or released at sites that undergo investigation andor remediation by regulatory agencies we may be responsible under cercla or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of investigation andor remediation and for damages to natural resources we may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from those properties some of these matters may require expending significant amounts for investigation cleanup or other costs   in addition new laws new interpretations of existing laws increased governmental enforcement of environmental laws or other developments could require us to make additional significant expenditur es continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments for environmental controls at any future production facility present and future environmental laws and regulations applicable to msw processing and energy production more vigorous enforcement policies and discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on the results of our contemplated operations and financial position   the hazards and risks associated with processing msw and producing andor transporting various energy or chemical products such as fires natural disasters explosions and abnormal pressures and blowouts may also result in personal injury claims or damage to property and third parties as protection against operating hazards we intend to maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses we could however sustain losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage events that result in significant personal injury or damage to our property or third parties or other losses that are not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the results of our contemplated operations and financial position   risks related to our common stock and stock price fluctuation   our stock is thinly traded so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all     o ur common stock trades on the otcqb shares of our common stock are thinlytraded meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent this situation is attributable to a number of factors including     ● we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts stock brokers institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume and   ● stock analysts stock brokers and institutional investors may be riskaverse and be reluctant to follow an unproven early stage company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable        as a consequence our stock price may not reflect an actual or perceived value also there are periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or nonexistent as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price a broader or more active public trading market for our common shares may not develop or if developed may not be sustained due to these conditions you may not be able to sell your shares at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares   even if an active trading market develops the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations   we believe that newer alternative energy companies and companies that effect reverse mergers such as our company are particularly susceptible to speculative trading that may not be based on the actual performance of the company which increases the risk of price volatility in a common stock in addition the price of the shares of our common stock could decline significantly if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors some of the factors that could affect the volatility of our share price include     ● significant sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market   ● speculation in the press or investment community   ● actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results   ● change s in earnings estimates   ● publication or lack of publication of research reports about us   ● increases in market interest rates which may increase our cost of capital   ● changes in applicable law s or regulations court rulings and other legal actions   ● change s in market valuations of similar companies   ● additions or departures of key personnel   ● actions by our stockholders and   ● general market and economic conditions   trading in our common stock is subject to special sales practices and may be difficult to sell   our common stock is subject to the securities and exchange commission ’s “penny stock” rule which imposes special sales practice requirements upon brokerdealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers or accredited investors penny stocks are generally defined to be an equity security that has a market price of less than  per share for purposes of the rule the phrase “accredited investors” means in general terms institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals having a net worth or a joint net worth with the person’s spouse in excess of  or having an annual income that exceeds  or that when combined with a spouse’s income exceeds  for transactions covered by the rule the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale consequently the rule may affect the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and also may affect the ability of our shareholders in this offering to sell their securities in any market that might develop        stockholders should be aware that according to securities and exchange commission release no  the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse such patterns include     ● control of the market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer   ● manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases   ● “ boiler room” practices involving highpressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons   ● excessive and undisclosed bidask differentials and markups by selling broke rdealers and   ● the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses   our manag ement is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of brokerdealers who participate in the market management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our common stock   substantial future sales of our common stock shares in the public market could cause our stock price to fall   if our stockholde rs sell substantial amounts of our common stock or the public market perceives that stockholders might sell substantial amounts of our common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems appropriate as of december    we had i  shares of our common stock outstanding and ii also have outstanding convertible notes including accrued interest with warrants convertible into approximately  million shares of our common stock and warrants immediately exercisable and representing the right to purchase approximately  million shares of our common stock an additional  shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to our  stock option plan   potential issuance of additional common and preferred stock could dilute existing stockholders   we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock to the extent of such authorization our board of directors has the ability without seeking stockholder approval to issue additional shares of common stock in the future for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient we are also authorized to issue up to ten million shares of preferred stock the rights and preferences of which may be designated in series by the board of directors such designation of new series of preferred stock may be made without stockholder approval and could create additional securities which would have dividend and liquidation preferences over the common stock offered hereby preferred stockholders could adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock by     ● exercising voting redemption and conversion rights to the detriment of the holders of common stock   ● receiving preferences over the holders of common stock regarding a surplus of funds in the event of our dissolution or liquidation   ● delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and   ● discouraging bids for our common stock   in all the situations described above the issuance of additional common stock in the future will reduce the proportionate owner ship and voting power of our current stockholders   item b    unresolved staff comments   not applicable

of operation s   the following discussion of our plan of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance these statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results levels of activity or performance these risks and other factors include among others those listed under “statement regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” and those included elsewhere in this report   as a result of the limited operating history of our company prior years ’ financial statements provide little information and virtually no guidance as to our future performance except to the extent we continue to incur net losses in order to finance our business beyond this stage we will be required to raise additional capital or identify another source of outside funding all of our potential developmentsprojects will require a significant amount of capital while we continue to pursue outside sources of funding we have not had success securing meaningful amounts of financing as a result we can provide no assurance that we will secure any funding in the immediate time frame required and the failure to do so will likely result in an inability to continue operations management hopes to secure additional funds through equity or debt financing government grants or project financings until such time as the company begins to generate revenue and the company’s revenues and cash flow are sufficient to meet its cost structure and ultimately achieve profitable operations the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties we may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain acceptable financing on a timely basis our business will likely fail and our common stock may become worthless        overview   our

subscription agreements our equity offering  we are continuing to explore opportunities to raise cash through the issuance of these units and other financing opportunities however to date we have not been successful in doing so as of march   our current cash and other assets are not sufficient to fund our operations as of december   we had a significant working capital deficit our liabilities are substantially greater than our current assets our only significant assets are our intellectual property rights which are intangible and not readily convertible into liquid assets   we are attempting to identify one or more potential sources of additional financing such as through the sale of additional equity various government funding opportunities andor possibly through strategic alliances with larger energy or waste management companies the company will continue to explore and if identified evaluate financing alternatives andor other transactions including potentially retaining a financial advisor however we may not be successful in securing additional financing if we are not able to obtain additional financing in the immediate future we will be required to further delay our development until such financing becomes available further even assuming that we secure additional funds we may never achieve profitability or positive cash flow if we are not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital andor achieve profitability or positive cash flow we will not have sufficient capital resources to implement our business plan or to continue our operations    debt

any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement with an unconsolidated entity under which we have     ● a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit   ● liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets or   ● an obligation including a contingent obligation arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by and material to us where such entity provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us   critical accounting estimates   longlived assets – our acquisition and merger activities have resulted in aggregate licensing and patent assets of approximately  million as of december   we are required to conduct impairment tests of longlived assets on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying value as we have not commenced commercial operations these assets have not yet been placed in service   deferred taxe s  we recognize deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the company has incurred no income taxes to date any benefits are the result of temporary differences startup costs stock compensation and other items and operating loss carryforwards the difference between the expected income tax benefit and nonrecognition of an income tax benefit in each period is the result of a valuation allowance applied to deferred tax assets a valuation allowance in the same amount of the benefit has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset as realization of the asset is not assured   stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires measuring all stockbased compensation awards at fair value and recognizing an expense in the financial statements we compensate certain employees officers directors and consultants with sharebased payment awards and recognize compensation costs for these awards based on their fair values and expense is recognized over the requisite service period the fair values of certain awards are estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing formula which incorporates certain assumptions including the expected term of an award and expected stock price volatility        convertible notes payable and warrants – the company has issued various convertible promissory notes “notes” these notes may be converted at the option of the note holder into shares of the company’s common stock additionally these notes carry warrants for shares of the company’s common stock these promissory notes have been recorded as debt notes payable in the financial statements net of discounts if any for the conversion and warrant features the discounts have been amortized on a straightline basis over the term of each note   fair value measurement  we use fair value accounting and reporting to specify a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources or reflect our own assumptions of market participant valuation the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows     ● level  – quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities   ● level  – quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly and   ● level  – prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable   as of and during the year ended december    and  we utilized level  inputs to determine the fair value of cash equivalents and we utilized level  inputs to determine the fair value of certain longlived assets   restricted stock compensation – from time to time we issue restricted common stock to employees directors and consultants as compensation the cost of these grants is recorded in general and administrative expense the cost is determined using the amount of shares granted at a discount to the market value on the date of the grant the discount is applied for a lack of marketability due to i shares issued are unregistered shares and subject to rule  of the securities act ii minimal trading activity in our shares only about  rd of which are registered and freetrading shares and iii the company has yet to begin operations and has had no revenue   contingent liabilities – we are from time to time subject to litigation to our business assessments regarding the ultimate cost of lawsuits require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters we regularly review the valuation of these liabilities and account for changes in circumstances for ongoing and emerging issues the company intends to defend itself vigorously in all litigation   item a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about

inc’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits   we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement the company and its subsidiaries are not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of their internal control over financial reporting our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit also includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion   in our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the financial position of cleantech biofuels inc and subsidiaries as of decembe r   and  and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   the accompa nying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company and its subsidiaries will continue as a going concern as discussed in note  to the financial statements the company’s significant operating losses and recent inability to secure additional capital to implement its business plan raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the consolidated

and business   alternative ethanol technologies inc  the “company” was incorporated in delaware on december   effective august   the company changed its name to cleantech biofuels inc except where otherwise noted the words “we” “us” “our” and similar terms as well as “cleantech” or the “company” refer to cleantech biofuels inc and its’ subsidiaries collectively   on march   the company acquired srs energy inc a delaware corporation “srs energy” pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization in accordance with the merger agreement srs acquisition sub inc a delaware corporation and whollyowned subsidiary of the company merged with and into srs energy the merger was consummated on may   and resulted in srs energy becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of the company as a result of the merger the stockholders of srs energy surrendered all of their issued and outstanding common stock and received shares of the company’s common stock  par value per share “common stock” the former parent of srs energy supercritical recovery systems inc immediately prior to the merger distributed  of its  ownership in srs energy to its shareholders on a pro rata basis for accounting purposes because the company had been a public shell company prior to the merger the merger was treated as an acquisition of the company and a recapitalization of srs energy   the company is in its development stage and has been engaged in technology development and preoperational activities since its formation the company is currently seeking outside sources of funding to design and build a commercial biomass recovery plant to provide biomass feedstock for customer evaluation and trial purchases initially the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities power and steam producers and biofuel and chemical research firms for evaluation in addition to research and development the company is also working towards licensing andor developing potential commercial projects these projects plan to focus on cleaning and separating municipal solid waste also referred to as msw into its component parts in order to obtain i a homogenous feedstock of cellulosic biomass for producing energy and other chemical products and ii recyclable products metals plastics aluminum   the company has no operating history as a producer of biomass or energy sources and has not constructed any plants to date we have no revenues and will be required to secure outside funding in order to execute our business plan and commercialize our products our current cash is not sufficient to fund our current operations our liabilities are substantially greater than our current available funds and current assets although we continue to seek additional financing through the sale of additional equity various government funding opportunities andor possibly through strategic alliances with larger energy or waste management companies we have not had recent success securing meaningful amounts of financing the company will require substantial additional financing to implement its business plan and it may be unable to obtain the capital required to do so if we are not able to immediately and successfully raise additional capital andor achieve profitability or positive cash flow we may not be able to continue operations   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ materially from those estimates   consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of cleantech biofuels inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries srs energy in ctb licensing llc and van keuren llc all significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation   research and development costs  research and development expenditures which are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including wages and associated employee benefits facilities and overhead costs including payments to collaborative research partners are expensed as incurred        impairment of longlived assets  the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of longlived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable primarily through reviewing changes in business plans and use of such assets when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment the company reviews longlived assets to assess future use or recoverability of such asset impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value   intellectual property  intellectual property consisting of our licensedowned patents and other proprietary technology are stated at cost and will be amortized on a straightline basis over their economic estimated useful life costs and expenses incurred in creating intellectual property are expensed as incurred the cost of purchased intellectual property is capitalized amortization of these assets has not yet begun as the assets have not been placed in service as we have not yet commenced operations   property  plant and e quipment  newly acquired property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets on the straightline method for financial reporting purposes expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred   income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires the company to provide a net deferred tax assetliability equal to the expected future tax benefitexpense of temporary reporting differences between financial statement and tax accounting methods and any available operating loss or tax credit carry forwards the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred taxes also are recognized for operating losses and tax credits that are available to offset future taxable income   the standards on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes incorporated into the fasb accounting standards codification codification topic  income taxes clarify the accounting and recognition for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the company’s income tax returns the company’s income tax filings are subject to audit by various taxing authorities the company’s open audit periods are  in evaluating the company’s tax provisions and accruals future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences interpretations and tax planning strategies are considered the company believes their estimates are appropriate based on facts and circumstances   convertible notes payable and warrants – the company has issued various convertible promissory notes the “notes” these notes may be converted at the option of the note holder into shares of the company’s common stock additionally some of these notes carry warrants for shares of the company’s common stock these notes have been recorded as debt notes payable in the financial statements net of discounts if any for the conversion and warrant features the discounts have been amortized on a straightline basis over the term of each note   s tock based compensation  the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires measuring all stockbased compensation awards at fair value and recognizing an expense in the financial statements in march  the company adopted the  stock option plan “stock plan” for its employees officers directors and consultants  the company has reserved a maximum of  shares of common stock to be issued for stock options or shares of restricted stock under the stock plan we compensate certain employees officers directors and consultants with stockbased payment awards and recognize compensation costs for these awards based on their fair values and expense is recognized over the requisite service period the fair values of certain awards are estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing formula which incorporates certain assumptions including the expected term of an award and expected stock price volatility our key assumptions are described in further detail in the sharebased payments note to the consolidated financial statements   fair value measurement  we use fair value accounting and reporting to specify a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources or reflect our own assumptions of market participant valuation the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows     ● level  – quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities   ● level  – quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly and   ● level  – prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable        as of december    and  and during the years ended december    and  we utilized level  inputs to determine the fair value of cash equivalents and we utilized level  inputs to determine the fair value of certain longlived assets   restricted stock compensation – from time to time we issue restricted common stock to employees directors and consultants as compensation the cost of these grants is recorded in general and administrative expense the cost is determined using the amount of shares granted at a discount to the market value on the date of the grant the discount is applied for a lack of marketability due to i shares issued are unregistered shares and subject to rule  of the securities act of  ii minimal trading activity in our shares only about  rd of which are registered and freetrading shares and iii the company has yet to begin operations and has had no revenue the company issued shares in   and  as detailed further in note    contingent liabilities – we are from time to time subject to litigation to our business assessments regarding the ultimate cost of lawsuits require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number and cost of pending and future claims and the impact of evidentiary requirements a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters we regularly review the valuation of these liabilities and account for changes in circumstances for ongoing and emerging issues the company intends to defend itself vigorously in all litigation   dividends  we have no material operating history and therefore have had no earnings to distribute to stockholders we currently intend to retain our earnings if any and reinvest them in the development and growth of our business and do not foresee payment of a dividend in any upcoming fiscal period   net loss per common share  the company calculates basic loss per share eps and diluted eps basic loss per share is computed as net loss divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted eps would reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options warrants and other convertible securities as of december    and  the company had options warrants and convertible notes to purchase an aggregate of approximately  million  million and  million shares of common stock respectively that were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effects would have been antidilutive therefore the company only presents basic loss per share on the face of the statements of operations and in its disclosure of unaudited quarterly financial data in note    recent accounting pronouncement s – in march  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu no  “compensationstock compensation” this asu simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment

executive compensation policy   we believe that a critical factor in attracting and retaining talented and dedicated management that is necessary for our success is the establishment and fair implementation of a comprehensive executive compensation program accordingly our overall compensation philosophy is to offer our executives and other members of our management team compensation and benefits that meet and enhance our goals of attracting retaining and motivating highly skilled people to work together as a team to achieve our financial and strategic business objectives  provided however that our ability to pay salaries and other benefits to our executive officers is significantly limited by our lack of financial resources and revenues in furtherance of our compensation philosophy and subject to our financial resources our executive compensation program is designed to     ● provide fair and reasonable compensation that meets the competitive environment for executive talent   ● help motivate the members of our executive team for excellent performance and   ● align the interests of our executive team members with those of our stockholders and the longterm success of our company   while all decisions regarding executive compensation are ultimately made by our board of directors they also rely on the recommendations of the chief executive officer with respect to all of our executive officers other than the chief executive officer himself particularly with regard to his assessment of each executive officer ’s individual performance against achievement of strategic objectives level of responsibility exercised and the level of specialized experience and knowledge required to do the job determinations by our board of directors are not made in accordance with strict formulas which measure weighted qualitative and quantitative factors rather such determinations are more subjective in nature and take into account not only the recommendations of our chief executive officer but such other factors as deemed relevant in an effort to blend competitive ranges into our own internal policies and practices the board of directors may also seek advice from a compensation consultant        our current executive officer entered into a threeyear employment agreement with the company effective as of august   that provides for among other things the base salary if any of such executive officer s compensation package this employment contract permits us to increase but not decrease base salary within the contract term the contract expired on august   and by its terms automatically renews for additional oneyear periods unless terminated by either the company or the employee this agreement is currently in effect   elements of our executive compensation program   our executive officer program consists of three basic elements base salary  annual incentive bonus and longterm incentive compensation currently our executive officer whose compensation is reported in the summary compensation table are paid their approved salaries as cash is available and have not been paid any bonus subject to our ability to identify and execute on an outside funding source we expect in the future we will begin paying the remaining named executive officer salary and bonuses consistent with his position and job performance consistent with our executive officer compensation philosophy we have structured each element of our compensation package as follows   base salary  in december  annual base salaries effective beginning november  were approved of  for mr hennessey and  for mr jennewein salaries are currently paid based on cash availability and therefore neither mr hennessey or mr jennewein was paid his full salary in  or  salary that is not paid is accrued in our financial statements currently the salaries paid to our executive officers as a group are substantially less than the salaries typically paid to executives with the experience and background of our executive officers    bonuses  none of our executive officers were paid a bonus in  or  we do not currently have any bonus plan for executive officers   longterm incentive compensation  the longterm incentive awards for our executive officers can be made under our  stock option plan under which the board of directors may among other things grant or award stock options and other stockbased awards subject to certain limitations and restrictions as set forth in the plan our use of stockbased awards for our executive officers is the primary means by which we provide our executive officers a longterm incentive that becomes more valuable to the executive to the extent our share value increases thereby aligning each executive’s interest with the interest of our stockholders   it is the policy of the board of directors that with respect to all equitybased compensation for the executive officers the award dates for each grant shall be specified by the board of directors at a duly convened meeting as of a date on or after the date of its action and that the exercise price or value of the grant shall be determined by reference to the closing price of our common stock on the specified award date see “outstanding equity awards at fiscal yearend” table for additional information equity grants may also be made to new executive officers upon commencement of their employment and on occasion to executive officers and members of our board of directors in connection with a significant change in job responsibility extraordinary performance or other reasons   tax and accounting implications   section m of the internal revenue code generally precludes a public company from taking a federal income tax deduction for annual compensation in excess of  million per individual paid to its chief executive officer or the other named executi ve officers under section m certain compensation including “performancebased compensation” is excluded from this deduction limitation our intent is to structure compensation paid to our executives to be deductible however from time to time the board of directors may award compensation that may not be deductible if it determines that such awards are consistent with our compensation philosophy and in the best interest of our stockholders we believe that all of the  compensation paid to our executive officers is fully deductible        outstanding equity awards at fiscal yearend  the following table provides information on stock options and restricted stock awards granted to the named executive
