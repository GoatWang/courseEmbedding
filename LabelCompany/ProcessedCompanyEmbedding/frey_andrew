fabrication are moisture penetration and attractiveness as an example he pointed to an apartment building project in coral gables completed while frey was with his previous employer to tackle the moisture issue the development team paid special attention to the window assemblies and to any areas where water could penetrate the stucco on the aesthetic side they worked within the city of coral gables’ incentives for mediterranean architecture to design a complicated envelope articulated to break up the plane of the front wall in general observed frey the facade is “extremely important” in an urban environment for an attached product in particular “it’s the only differentiation that the building will have because you don’t see the sides or back” he said “townhouses row houses brownstones—for that kind of a building the facade is all it has” with respect to how miami building regulations impact envelope design and construction frey mentioned two potential problem areas the first concerns miamidade county’s hurricane code which requires special approval for every product used “the state of florida and national building codes don’t count so you’re somewhat limited in your choices” he said frey cited frank gehry’s new world center as a case in point “when going through conceptual approval they were proposing a very minimally supported glass wall” he said “what they wound up being able to build had very thick structural members” frey acknowledged that other factors including cost may have led to the change in design second and more troublesome for frey is the subjective design review process from his point of view the existence of stringent design standards without an underlying commitment to finegrained urban development reflects a confusion of priorities “a lot of jurisdictions want to put in place very complicated facade design guidelines but what they really need to do is to make smallscale urbanism developable” explained frey “if your zoning just encourages super tall towers where the ground floor is an afterthought of course you’re going to get monotonous throwaway lower facades” hear more from frey his copanelists and other leading voices in
