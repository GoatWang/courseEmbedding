powers william f jrset in lates los angeles the easter bunny conspiracy is a grippingly funny comingofage tale told from the point of view of a precocious   yearold catholic boy chris kelly chris is struggling to find himself despite the burdens of his being as overweight as he is obsessed with and equally confused by girls being as agnostic as he is catholic and as unsure as he is almost poised about coping with all the crazy but accepted traditions customs prejudices contradictions and hypocrisies with which hes confronted each day chris problem is that he hasnt yet figured out that hes right to be confused about everyone around him so readily accepting being grounded in one way or another on deceits such as what chris calls that easter bunny thing chris needs are simple  just to make his way in the world aided by flashbacks on his own experiences chris story is about his overcoming the fiery crucible of the  days before his confirmation which enable him to reach his personal epiphany and stride with semiconfidence into his stilluncertain future with an ethically tolerable plan our voyage through these stormy adolescent seas is at once poignant and hilarious its bittersweet comedy at its best you cant help but love ithumorouscondition hpb condition ratingsnew item is brand new unused and unmarked in flawless conditionfinelike new f no defects little usage may
