eastern standard time chicagobusiness wirefitch ratings has taken the following rating actions on cnh equipment trust b cnh b class a affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class a affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class a affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class b upgraded to aasf from asf outlook positive key rating drivers the affirmation of the class a notes in cnh b reflects credit enhancement levels that are consistent with the ratings and strong collateral performance to date as of the november  reporting period the pool has only experienced  bps of cumulative net losses which is lower than fitchs initial expectations the upgrade to aasf from asf for the class b notes is also attributable to increasing credit enhancement and loss coverage levels the positive outlook for the notes reflects fitchs view that the notes will continue to perform well and may warrant a review for potential positive rating action in the next    months rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy which would impact available loss coverage lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to x and x higher than fitchs base case loss expectation initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the presale report dated may   to date the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses within fitchs initial expectation and strong loss coverage and multiple levels as such continued performance for the transaction would most likely result in further positive rating actions conversely a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings fitchs analysis of the representations and
