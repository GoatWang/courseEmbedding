role at san francisco’s irhythm technologies was an opportunity for matthew garrett to bring his career full circle over two decades in life science he has progressed from old school pacemakers to irhythm’s digital cardiac monitoring technology enlarge matthew garrett chief financial officer irhythm technologies inc so how has the medical device industry changed in the meantime “that would require a bottle of scotch and a few hours” garrett said “the overall market has changed significantly” irhythm for its part sells a combination of wearable sensors and cloudbased heart monitoring software to detect cardiac arrhythmias the nineyearold company made headlines last fall with a  million ipo that surged past analyst expectations “last year we kind of got to that decision point we needed an infusion of cash” garrett said “going into the open market you never know how you’re going to be received” among the major strategic shifts he has overseen in four years at the financial helm of the company is a move away from a traditional third party billing model of sales to the consumer which sometimes left providers on the hook if insurance companies decided against reimbursement instead irhythm now contracts directly with medicare and insurance companies negotiating its own reimbursement rates “we think of our self as a healthcare service rather than a product” garrett said “it puts the risk directly on us as the company to get paid but it also opens doors” garret grew up in iowa and he’s up front about the fact that making the leap to high tech medical devices was far from a seamless transition starting out in smaller job markets in the midwest made it more difficult to break into corporate finance “trying to establish a meaningful job was hard” garrett said “i spent four or five months working night jobs and working as a waiter” he worked his way up the financial ladder at cardiovascular device maker guidant corporation where the diagnostic market he is now targeting with irhythm was far from a focus area “in those days there was very little appetite for moving into the diagnostic realm” garrett recalled at irhythm garrett said the company is considering a number of strategic paths to take advantage of the plentiful health data generated by its biometric sensors “we capture beat to beat heart rates for the full  days” he said “there are any number of avenues we could go down” matthew c garrett company irhythm technologies inc title chief financial officer tenure present background corventis acquired by medtronic cogentus pharmaceuticals affymetrix
