atrocious acts and mindset to some form of psychopathy singular to the rise of nazism by psychiatrists including the featured douglas m kelley and to a lesser extent his bete noir the psychologist gustav gilbert following his term in nuremberg kelleys life is explored through his subsequent workthe key issue of whether nazism is a function of a mental disorder unique to the times or these nazis studied presented were basically indistinguishable psychologically from the normal people in society remains a contentious subject today this is the main premise of this bookthe cover of this book lends the impression it is about primarily goering and kelley and their fatal meeting of minds is patently sensationalistic this distorts and diminishes the message that lurking in each of us is the capacity to effect evil acts in certain nurturing circumstancescomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web

unsuspectedly normal personality of mass murderersbesides this it gives interesting insights into the personal life of one of the psychiatrists douglas kelley involved in maintaining the health of the prisoners including both his relationship with hermann göring and his own family although this may sometimes look like a splitting of the narrative its leitmotiv concerns some similarities between

interaction between two egotists psychiatrist dr douglas mc kelley and the nazi second in command reich marshal herman goering it is well researched from army and academic archives but also from personal records kept by dr kelleys son douglas jrthe insights into the two protagonists personalities are well drawn and very believable the good versus evil theme is also presented the questioned raised as to whether dr kelley was forever changed by the evil spector of goering is never really answered but left for the reader to ponderfascinating history well presented this would make a good

sfgate subscribe sign in menusections httpwwwsfgatecombayareaarticlemysterioussuicideofnuremburgpsychiatristphp mysterious suicide of nuremburg psychiatrist joan ryan published  am sunday february   fortyseven years have washed over the memory of that new years day in  doug kelley was  years old his brain stored what happened that day in snapshots his father exploding in rage in the kitchen of their sprawling kensington home his father on the stairs with the vial of white powder his father on the floor jerking and foaming his eyes wild his grandfather trying to pour water down his throat the ambulance but all these years later kelley still doesnt know why his father did what he did in front of his family on a day that seemed no different from any other day nobody knows why not his mother who is  now or his younger brother and sister latest news videos i heard about dr douglas kelley from a reader responding to my column last week i wrote about a psychiatrist who had interviewed nazi war criminals awaiting trial in nuremberg after world war ii that psychiatrist had been one of six or seven rotated in by the us army during the several years of the tribunal the reader asked whether i knew about douglas kelley the most famous of the nuremberg psychiatrists he wrote a book called  cells in nuremberg upon his return to the united states he committed suicide the reader said by taking potassium cyanide just like hermann goering i had heard he never got over his experience in nuremberg the case was almost five decades old what did it matter now but i kept thinking about it had he carried back from those  cells something darker than psychiatric reports was there a part of him that was hollowed out by living inside the minds of men who killed so easily i couldnt help but do a little digging i discovered something i didnt expect kelley was a local guy he was a descendant of cf mcglashen who was famous for discovering the donner party he was born in truckee and grew up in san francisco he was a straighta student at lowell and an eagle scout he graduated from uc berkeley earned his medical degree at ucsf and on a rockefeller fellowship earned a second doctorate in medical science from columbia at the time of his death he was a famous professor of psychiatry and criminology at uc berkeley his suicide was frontpage news for two days in the chronicle he was just  years old he had attended a new years eve party the night before he was his usual jovial self one guest was quoted as saying he had driven into san francisco earlier in the day to pick up his father a dentist so they could watch the rose bowl on the familys new color television he left no note his act just doesnt make sense berkeley police chief john holstrom a friend of kelleys told the paper i tracked down doug kelley the son in fairfield he is  and is still trying to solve the mystery kelley grew up to be in his own words a burned out lefty he dropped out of college during the vietnam war fathered a son at  and spent a decade wandering around the world he married four times he has worked for the us postal service for the past  years he was cooking dinner burned himself and exploded kelley said the next thing we knew he was on the stairs saying he was going to swallow the potassium cyanide and that hed be dead in  seconds his wife father and three children witnessed his death some speculated according to the  chronicle story that dr kelley brought the potassium cyanide back from nuremberg but his wife and son say he had so many different medicines and concoctions in his home laboratory that he could have gotten the poison anywhere still his papers from nuremberg and comments recalled by his son suggest he connected with goering as a person in his book he expresses admiration for goering for taking his own life at his own convenience and in a manner of his own choosing his suicide shrouded in mystery  was a skillful even brilliant finishing touch he wrote  history may well show that goering won out in the end kelleys widow alicevivienne kelley has no more of an answer today to her husbands death than she did  years ago she lives in santa barbara in a large house overlooking the ocean she is still as proper and private as her southern blueblood upbringing taught her to be she remembered her husband as endlessly interesting and incomparably brilliant he was an early practitioner of the rorschach test publishing a book on the technique in  he was a leading expert in the use of psychiatry in law enforcement serving as a consultant and a prosecution witness in highprofile murder cases he was a gourmet cook and a magician  a lively driven genius whose interests and affinities had no bounds i dont know what happened right at the end there she said over the phone in her soft tennessee drawl i never did know why he wasnt unhappy i just put it out of my mind i dont want to try to remember she said it probably is a coincidence that her husband died by the same method as goering i think so she said i dont know see a lot of things i didnt know i didnt feel it was my right to be curious about certain things i wish i could give you a really clear picture of how he was thinking at the time but its not anything i want to think about it is just a mystery kelleys son doug said his mothers recollections and the newspaper accounts dont tell the whole story his father had a dark side that he didnt show in public he was an alcoholic who frequently erupted in anger he had threatened suicide at least once before maybe he took on too much responsibility with his many professional pursuits maybe he understood too well from his time at nuremberg the quiet insanity that can lurk inside smart and accomplished men all through his papers from nuremberg his interviews show men who are so surprised they ended up where they did kelley said kelley has some of the memorabilia his father took from nuremberg some of it too bizarre for explanation inside a flat yellow kodak box is a series of xrays of a head that is labeled as adolf hitlers there is a typed and translated copy of hitlers will he has small packages of chocolates and cookies carefully wrapped in writing paper on which rudolf hess asks kelley to check if his guards have been poisoning him dr kelley also had for some reason many letters from goering to his wife why did it have to turn out this way goering writes if we had even suspected this development we would certainly have gone another way and there is a note from goering to dr kelley i regret your departure from nuremberg as do the comrades confined with me i thank you for your human behavior and also for your attempt to understand our reasons doug kelley remembers appearing with his father on a tv show his father hosted for kqed called the criminal mind on this episode doug kelley played a little boy whose father snaps when the boy wont stop beating a drum it analyzed how certain frustrations led to violent behavior kelley recalled for a man who spent his life studying breaking points he seemed to have understood so little about his own i know its ironic kelley said i think maybe he knew he was on a runaway train i think he knew what was inside but he didnt know how to make it go away maybe dr douglas kelley took from those  cells in nuremberg something darker than just letters and rorschach results or maybe his furious intellect burned itself out or maybe he was mentally ill for doug kelley what is left of his father are boxes and boxes of psychiatric evaluations and notes that show what was in the minds of nazi leaders and local murderers and kidnappers what they dont tell him is what was in his fathers latest from the sfgate homepageclick below for the top news from around the bay

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

were fit for trial at nuremberg the us army sent an ambitious army psychiatrist captain douglas m kelley to supervise their mental wellbeing during their detention kelley realized he was being offered the professional opportunity of a lifetime to discover a distinguishing trait among these archcriminals that would mark them as psychologically different from the rest of humanity so began a remarkable relationship between kelley and his captors told here for the first time with unique access to kelleys longhidden papers and medical recordskelleys was a hazardous quest dangerous because

workings of the human mind likewise the human capacity for evil revealed in criminology and the study of history in particular the events of and surrounding wwii capture my curiosity and desire to understand kelley and i are certainly not alone in this and in the decades since wwii scholars from a variety of fields have sought to unravel the sociological psychological and historical underpinnings of what happened all of this is to say that i did not find dr kelley to as exceptional as the author may have intended that notable figures who work with notorious criminals are often somewhat egotistical is not surprising john e douglas the original mindhunter is an example that stands out see mindhunter inside the fbis elite serial crime unit  what author jack elhai refers to as teleempathy  the ability to feel what others are feeling and thinking after carefully examining them p seems like it would be requisite for the job from studies such as the milgram experiment and the stanford prison study both of which elhai refers to toward the end of the book we have learned more about quotidian obedience to authority books such as martha stouts the sociopath next door describe that individuals who completely lack conscience are by no means an anomaly the most interesting pieces of information in re the overthetop character of hermann göring  which are almost unfathomably bizarre his extreme pill addiction his letter writing campaign to president truman regarding the inhumane conditions in which he was being kept his obsession with wild animals etc were brushed over too quickly for my liking in favor of kelleys family history while i enjoyed this book i feel like it could have done more perhaps that was not the authors intention but somehow the parallels between göring and kelley failed to draw me in as stories unto themselves furthermore these characteristics seemed to me less exceptional less notable than one might believe based on this material alone kelley told journalists that göring is still the same swaggering vain conceited braggart he always was he has made up his mind hes going to be killed anyway so hes very anxious to be considered the number one nazi a curious kind of compensation p this desire to rise to the top one that kelley apparently shared with göring seemed to me unsurprising it certainly didnt seem like a trait so noteworthy as to suggest that two men sharing it would somehow be distant reflections of oneanother ill withhold the other big parallel as not to spoil anything but i again thought it was a bit overstated more flag  likes · like  · see review view all  comments jul   judie rated it it was amazing dr douglas m kelley who served as a psychiatrist for the us army in world war ii received an

douglas m kelley who served as a psychiatrist for the us army in world war ii received an order to be the lead psychiatrist and work with the high level nazis being detained for trial at nuremberg after the war he saw it as an opportunity to try to discern if there was there a common flaw among the nazi leaders “we must learn they why of the nazi success so we can take steps to prevent the recurrence of such evil” “what made these men criminals” “were they born with evil tendencies” “did they share psychiatric disorders” “the trial and it runup served as fascinating laboratories for the study of group dynamics of aggression criminal motivation defense mechanisms of the guilty depression and the response of deviant personalities to the judicial process” his conclusions are as relevant in the united states today in  as they were in  hermann göring president of the reichstag hitler’s deputy prime minister of prussia reich minister of aviation and commander in chief of the luttwaffe minister of economics member of the secret cabinet council director of the hermann göring works manufacturing combine field marshal chairman of the reich council for national defense reich forestry and hunting master and reichsmarshall was the highest ranking nazi in detention after seeing the films taken when the concentration camps were liberated he stated he didn’t know the extent of the atrocities committed against the victims and thought it was enemy propaganda until that point he wanted all codefendants to “defend themselves be proud of their actions and accept the punishment of the victors as a unified group” at first he told his fellows to expected exile then a group execution which “would grant them an afterlife as national martyrs” unlike the others he didn’t blame hitler or the nazi regime he considered himself a moving force in the nazi movement” kelley spent a lot of time with göring admiring his intelligence but aware of his dark side in a letter to his wife göring suggested that if both of them did not survive the war their daughter should be sent to live in the us with kelley and his wife the first two pages of the nazi and the psychiatrist tell about the suicide of dr kelley on january   the book then moves back to may   realizing the war was soon ending göring sent a letter offering to help the allies form a new government for the reich the americans captured him but he didn’t get to meet with general dwight eisenhower or any other officials instead he was taken into custody as a criminal for his crimes in world war ii at the time he was addicted to paracodeine taking forty pills a day five tablets had the narcotic effect of  mg of morphine an army official found that “göring’s hoard of paracodeine amounted to nearly the world’s entire supply” during the war kelley recognized “combat neurosis” and “combat exhaustion” now referred to as ptsd posttraumatic stress disorder and worked to rehabilitate soldiers and determine who could return to the battlefield or noncombatant duty and who should be returned the us for further treatment in the early years of the war only  of the its victims in the north africa campaign could return to duty after kelley trained physicians in ways to treat it more than  of the service personnel were able to do so he was able to use some of techniques when he worked with the nazi prisoners to help keep them fit for trial he combined psychiatry with criminology and also developed group therapy as psychiatric tool one of kelley’s coworkers captain john dolibois a welfare official helping detainees with their problems and listening to them observed “they spoke quite freely believing they would never face trial we sometimes had trouble getting them to shut up they felt neglected if they hadn’t been interrogated for a several days” the psychological staff was able to easily get information where traditional interrogation methods failed relying heavily on the rorschach or ink blot test he concluded“these people without hitler are not abnormal not perverts not geniuses they were like any other aggressive smart ambitious ruthless businessman and their business happened in the setting up of a world government” others working with him particularly lieutenant gustave mark gilbert who held a phd in psychology and wanted to gather information to write a book came to a different conclusion the nazi and the psychiatrist presents a detailed picture of the detainees lives before and after nuremberg a description of the courtroom itself the reaction of the nazis to the testimony and the verdicts it also tells what happened to each prisoner after the trial while most of the book deals with hermann göring and the relationship between him and kelley  the book presents information about each of the main defendants the men at the higher leadership roles in the nazi regime for example julius streicher editor of the exceedingly antijewish der stürmer was considered loathsome a pariah among the other prisoners he had a reputation as a sadist rapist and collector of pornography joachim von ribbentrop hitler’s foreign minister had only an elementary school education and had worked in the liquor business previously kelley questioned whether hess’s amnesia was real faked or somewhere in between had been faked then turned real but was able to show he was capable to stand trial the book also states that hitler had gastrointestinal disorders for more than twenty years though no organic cause was ever found by doctors because of that he feared death and acted impulsively he believed he had stomach cancer and “turned his attention from successful assaults on great britain to a campaign in the east that resulted in defeat” there were three suicides among the detainees two by hanging before the trial and one göring’s by swallowing a cyanide capsule the night before he was to be hung after kelley returned to the united states kelley was urged to write but he wanted to get away from the detentions and trial eventually did write about his experiences and examination as well as taught and trained law enforcement personnel his family life was extremely complex with him alternating between kindness and vicious enforcer he and his wife had major arguments and his children never knew how he would react to anything he refused to see a psychiatrist because he didn’t want to appear weak before a peer since he was an expert in the field he was excessively strict with his children especially his oldest son because he wanted to train him to not act like the germans did he was to be observant and analytical his son began thinking of killing his father when he was seven years old based on his interpretation of their psychological makeup and trying to answer his original questions about why the nazis acted as they did kelley said “unbridled ambition weak ethics and excessive patriotism that could justify nearly any action of questionable rightness” they were “not monsters evildoing machines or automata without soul and feelings” he wrote  cells “to influence the thinking of the american people and hoped readers would understand the qualities that allowed a group of men to dominate a country and let them believe they had the right to do sothat america could become germany” some of the nazi prisoners compared germany to the united states and it’s racial bigots and ultranationalists such as white supremacists senator theodore bilbo congressman john e rankin governor eugene talmadge and huey long to prevent people with personalities similar to the nazis from gaining control of the us “kelley advocated removing all restrictions on the voting rights of us citizens convincing as many americans as possible to vote in elections and rebuilding the educational system to cultivate students who could think critically and resist using ‘strong emotional reactions’ to make decisions finally he urged his countrymen to refuse to vote for any candidate who made ‘political capital’ of any group’s race and religious beliefs or referred indirectly or directly to the blood heritage or morals of opponents ‘the united states would never reach its full stature’ until it has undergone this transformation near the end of the book we read more of dr kelley’s suicide by cyanide capsule at the beginning nazi and the psychiatrist presents a list of the principle characters including their job titles the final book will include eight pages of photos and a full bibliography which includes writings by both dr kelley and lieutenant gilbert i received an

healthy and able to resume fighting always an intellectually curious man dr kelley was overjoyed to be reassigned to work with the surviving nazi leaderskelley served as a regular physician as needed but his specialty was analyzing the psychological fitness of these prisoners of particular interest to kelley was hermann göring hitler’s reichsmarschall and choice to take over germany after his deathdr kelley performed the psychological evaluations as required but he went one step further under the guise of administering routine tests kelley dug deeper into his nazi “patients” trying to discover if there was some trait some gene some sort of special indicator that facilitated these men becoming nazishis findings may surprise you so painstakingly thorough was his methodology that much of dr kelley’s research is still being analyzed over  years laterduring his tenure at nuremberg dr kelley developed close professional relationships with some of history’s mostfeared men the sheer normalcy even collegiality with which kelley and göring interacted was especially unexpected the guy who created the luftwaffe could be charming intelligent and even funnynaturally most of “the nazi and the psychiatrist” focuses on this period in dr kelley’s life however he was definitely not an ordinary army doctor kelley came from an intellectually driven background where mental discipline and broad curiosity were taught from a young age after he left the army kelley took a while to find his bearings eventually settling at his alma mater uc berkeley where he was the star professor in the school’s new criminology programin addition to teaching kelley served as a consultant to numerous law enforcement agencies tv shows even hollywood moviesas his professional life became more hectic life at home with his wife and three kids began to suffer and we are left to wonder if there might be a touch of psychosis in the psychiatrist“the nazi and the psychiatrist” is a fascinating book—with a promising title like that how could it not be one risk with historical treatises is that the author sometimes overreaches padding what could be an interesting story with endless dry recitation of factshappily “the nazi and the psychiatrist” avoids this pitfall beautifully author jack elhai presents plenty of information indeed i came away with a new understanding of both behavioral psychology and psychiatry as well as the nuremberg trials what elhai does so well is keep the story moving no single part of the story bogs down in minutiae he presents all manner of salient facts and details but he does a wonderful job editingas the title suggests at the core is the relationship between a nazi göring and psychiatrist kelley the prewar and postwar life of dr douglas kelley bookends his nuremberg experiences and this information is crucial also we go inside the nuremberg trials even after dr kelley had returned stateside this too is criticalthe resulting book is a gripping informative oddly bittersweet account of two men and how their extraordinary lives came tangent to one another for a brief moment in time it is most definitely a story worth reading that it’s true

psychiatrist in the us army medical service who was assigned to attend to the  top nazi defendants being held in nüremberg germany in the months before their trial began for crimes against humanity kelley spent long hours talking to the defendants and administering what were then relatively new psychiatric tests like rorschach ink blot testing and thematic apperception testsamong the nazi bigwigs kelley was responsible for the top patient was hermann göring former head of the luftwaffe and hitlers onetime designated successor görings huge personality and appetites were like a tractor beam for kelley he was charming intelligent and quickwitted but it soon became clear that he had no regard for anyone outside his small circle of family and close friendsas the book description tells us göring managed to kill himself with a cyanide capsule in his cell the night before he was scheduled to be hanged twelve years later kelley also killed himself with cyanide after a long slide into emotional illness and alcoholism the book description concludes that kelleys suicide shows the insidious impact of the göringkelley relationship providing a cautionary tale about the dangers of coming too close to evili think the book description is misleading author jack elhai does not try to make an argument that kelleys exposure to göring and the other nazis somehow tainted him and led to his suicide he does argue that there are some similarities between görings and kelleys motivations for suicide and for choosing cyanide as a method but thats the extent of itthe value of this book is not in some sensationalistic link between göring and kelley instead the real value is the inside look at the minds of these nazi leaders and how they revealed themselves to kelley whom many of them came to trust elhai writes a great deal about göring but there is also extensive and valuable discussion of rudolf hess alfred rosenberg robert ley joachim von ribbentrop julius streicher and others this should be of interest to many history readers especially those who enjoyed books like anthony reads the devils disciples hitlers inner circlesecondarily elhai gives us an insightful look at the early days of criminal psychology and psychiatric testing kelley was active in both fields including in the years after nüremberg when he lectured and consulted was a professor of psychiatry at wake forest university and in  became the first head of the newlyestablished department of criminology at the university of california at berkeley many of the concepts we take for granted today were in their infancy during this period and elhai provides a clear and interesting view of what the field was like at that timefinally elhai provides a fascinating description of various analysts views of kelleys records of the psychoanalytic tests of the nazi defendants and their debates about what they revealed about the nazi psycherights to the nazi and the psychiatrist have been optioned to turn it into both a film and a stage play i suspect in both cases the hook will be the same sensationalistic one as in the book description while that may make a good selling strategy i hope people will read and

wanted to hear that perhaps these leaders were narcissistic but otherwise normal people caught up in status power struggles and needs not unlike many people we see today this story hasnt really been told and is focused on dr kelleys personal struggle with his work with herman goering his own past and what he discovered any students of psychology philosophy or sociology should read this book  what are normal humans really capable of this quote should intrigue you to read this book it does not give anything away about the deeper storykelley knew that the nazis had committed atrocities and crimes of war on an unprecedented scale even the german leaders were surprised to realize what they had done and where they had ended up but men whose personalities fell within normal parameters had set in motion the nazi outrages making kelley worry that they could happen again “with the exception of dr ley there wasn’t an insane joe in the crowd” he told a reporter for the new yorker the leaders “were not special types” he wrote “their personality patterns indicate that while they are not socially desirable individuals their like could very easily be found in america” or elsewhere consequently he feared that holocausts and crimes against humanity could be repeated by psychologically similar perpetrators more flag  like · like  · see review view  comment apr   ray rated it liked it  ·  review of another edition jack elhais book the nazi and the psychiatrist tells the story of an army psychiatrist dr douglas kelley who interviewed hermann goering and the other top surviving nazi leaders

allowed those men to oversee so many atrocities to occur under their leadership after numerous interviews an jack el​hais book ​​the nazi and the psychiatrist​ tells the story of an army psychiatrist dr douglas kelley who interviewed ​hermann goering and ​the ​other ​top surviving nazi leaders after world war ii as they were preparing to face charges in the n​uremburg trials ​ his objective was to determine if there was a particular trait characteristic or psychiatric condition that caused or allowed those men to oversee so many atrocities to occur under their leadership after numerous interviews and tests dr kelley came to conclude that there was nothing particularly abnormal about these men the uncomfortable result of this conclusion is that the capability to perform similar atrocities was not unique to the nazi party or german people but can exist anywhere people can be incited to acts of cruelty by propaganda scare tactics repeated lies and distrust of others and when leaders exhibit these characteristics it should be a red flag to all citizens capable of critical thinking and independent thought to beware after the nuremberg trials dr kelley returned to private life and continued his practice and a lecturer writer psychiatrist consultant criminologist teacher and family man unfortunately for dr ryan and his family the stresses of his life brought out his darker side and led to an unfortunate and unhappy life two points st​uck with me upon completing jack el​hais book that even highly regarded psychologists who spend their time helping others overcome their stresses and problems are not immune from suffering from similar afflictions and  the capability to inflict injury or death on others is a trait of homo sapiens which can surface in any of us

resolved until the very end but frankly it kept me readingi thought the middle was not as strong elhai spends quite a bit of time recounting the nuremberg trials at this point kelley had gone home his work with the defendants completed i just feel that i can read about the nuremberg trials anywhere i would have preferred to read more about kelley hes such a rich character i think more could have been done to plumb those depths for example we get one paragraph on a major rift between kelley and a psychologist he worked with at nuremberg it seemed like a major conflict that could have had more attentionthis book is many things a biography of kelley a history of the nuremberg trials a small biography of goring and an analysis into the nazi mind and what kelleys tests may have revealed in a way it feels a little too stratified to methat being said this is a wellwritten book about a fascinating topic it won the  minnesota book award for general nonfiction and deservedly so more flag

replied that may well be but please show me a noman in germany who is not six feet underground today say no to the wrong person and whoever you are youre dead and there was always someone more than

corporate board of directors this one had unleashed six years of war upon the world cynically disregarded treaties and international agreements wiped out countless communities of innocent people

that perhaps all of us have wondered about why did they do it and could it happen again even in our own country there was never a deeply satisfying answer to this question a part of us wants to believe the nazis were psychopaths and completely unlike us kelley concluded that they were mostly “normal” folks but highly driven much like a corporate ceo or other ambitious capitalist and he thought it could happen again right under our noses the second intrigue was the eccentric herman goering kelley developed a close relationship with him and the reader is left to wonder what influence goering might have had on kelley like goering kelley was a bit of a showman and eventually like goering committed suicide with cyanide but as it turned out the nazi was far more interesting than the psychiatrist and the book peters out after kelley leaves germany it was still a very interesting read even a gripping read but i was left with the same haunting question i had when i started—how could

even sincerely believe that jews were inferior but rather were merely a convenient means of inciting fear and anger among the rest of the german populationa few passages of note some chillingly relevant in todays political climate kelley i was more than casually interested as a psychiatrist to find in rosenberg an individual who had developed a system of thought differing greatly from known fact who absolutely refused to amend his theories and who moreover firmly believed in the magic of the words in which he had expressed them hess had founded an alternativemedicine hospital that bore his name where the only requirement was that men practicing there could not be medical doctors kelley reported the antisemitism of the nazis stuck göring as useful bait for potential adherents with gripes more emotionally rooted than the mere imposition of an offensive peace treaty kelley they are people who exist in every country of the world their personality patterns are not obscure but they are people who have peculiar drives people who want to be in power and you say that they dont exist here and i would say that i am quite certain that there are people even in america who would
