bonventre is chief of the renal unit and director of the bioengineering division at brigham and women’s hospital and has had a longstanding interest in various aspects of cellular injury and repair mechanisms in the kidney with a special emphasis on the role of inflammation biomarkers and stem cells he has established the origin of the epithelial cells that repair the kidney after injury as dedifferentiated surviving proximal tubule cells he was the first to describe the role of proximal tubule cell cycle arrest in the maladaptive fibrosis that can occur after severe injury leading to chronic kidney disease he discovered and characterized kidney injury molecule kim as the most highly upregulated protein in the proximal tubule after injury to the kidney of various types kim expression converts the proximal tubule cell to a phagocyte kim is also a very sensitive and specific biomarker of proximal tubular injury in a variety of species including man and has been qualified by the fda and european medicines agency as a sensitive and specific marker for kidney injury in preclinical studies of nephrotoxicity he has created ips cells from patients with adult onset polycystic kidney disease and are working on ways to differentiate cells down the kidney lineagesearch pubmed for papers by joseph v bonventre md phdfeatured newsresearchers identify first blood

one focus of the lab is on kidney injury molecule which is markedly upregulated in renal cell carcinoma and other conditions where the kidney proximal epithelial cell is dedifferentiated we are studying the functional role of this protein and its role as a urinary biomarker for renal cell carcinoma and renal epithelial cell injury another focus is on phospholipase a pla and the role of this family of enzymes on carcinogenesis acute tissue injury apoptosis signal transduction and transcriptional regulation we have created a cpla null mouse and are studying the effects of absence of this gene on bowel cancer development in mice carrying the min mutation as well as angiogenesis and tumor growth in the cpla  mouse  studies are carried to understand how phospholipases a contribute to apoptosis to evaluate the importance of kinases such as the stressactivated map protein kinases and the proteins interacting with cpla to potentiate cell death and to identify and characterize transcription factors that play important roles in the cell cycle we have isolated a nuclear protein that interacts with the cytosolic  kda cpla and potentiates apoptosis gene therapy approaches with adenovirus are being used we have isolated a cdna encoding tripbr a novel transcriptional regulator which interacts with the phdbromodomain of the corepressors of krabmediated repression kriptif and tif as well as the coactivatoradaptor pcbp tripbr proteins make a direct functional contact with dp resulting in the stimulation of efdp transcriptional activity in this novel context krip cooperates with tripbr proteins to coactivate efdp coexpression of the retinoblastoma gene product rb abolishes baseline efdp transcriptional activity as well as tripbrkrip coactivation both of which are restored in the presence of the ea oncoprotein these features suggest that tripbr proteins function at efresponsive promoters to integrate regulatory signals provided by phd zinc finger andor
