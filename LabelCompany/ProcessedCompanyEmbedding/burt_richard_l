management wm“ in  xenia was the leading producer of transducers worldwide the company took pride in its mar keting product innovation and assembly excellence by  xenia’s asian competitor was selling its transducers for what it cost xenia to produce comparable units at that time xenia engineers de signed virtually all of xenia’s components which then were purchased from one or more of the ﬁrm’s  suppliers widespread competition was used to obtain the best price the selected supplier built to xenia drawings and speciﬁcations management at xenia responded to the competitive threat the corporation’s strategy shifted to a new set of core competencies marketing product innovation assembly and supply management the progression  chapteii  organizational issues  to supply management was enhanced by the establishment of an executive position the chief procurement ofﬁcer the cpo’s organization was retitled “supply management” the cpo became a member of the executive committee allowing for greater input in developing corporate strategy equally important sup ply management was able to ensure that its strategies were aligned with those of the corporation over a period of three years xenia reduced its supply base from  to  suppliers xenia worked with those suppliers to bring them to worldclass status with longterm contracts the suppliers became involved in the development of xenia’s new transducers the results cost of goods sold was reduced  percent incoming quality problems virtually disap peared the time required to move a new product from concept to customer was reduced  percent production lead times were reduced  percent all those results were achieved in only three years i qwwmm—  what was the most important shift in xenia’s set of core competencies  what impact did the appointment of a cpo at the executive level have on the supply management function  what is the impact of reducing the supply base how is this achieved  what might be some beneﬁts of getting suppliers involved in the development of xenia’s new transducers  what is the beneﬁt of reducing cost of goods sold time to market production lead times and quality problems  n any group activity three principal factors largely determine the level of performance attained by the group as a whole i the capabilities of the individuals i the motivation of the individuals i the organizational structure within which the individuals function this chapter focuses on the last factor the ﬁrst two factors are obvious to most businesspeople but to many people the impact of the third is less clear in the case of supply management the function’s location in the management hierarchy of a ﬁrm is important for this decision either facilitates or lim its the inﬂuence supply management policies and actions can have on the firm’s total performance within the department itself the form of organization selected inﬂuences the types and levels of expertise developed and also to a great extent the effectiveness with which the talents of individuals are utilized  a ﬁrm’s organizational structure reﬂects management’s basic attitudes toward the major activities involved in its operation where should the supply management function ﬁt in a ﬁmis organizational structure  paiit  the foundation placement of supply management within the organization the location of the supply management department within an entity’s organizational structure greatly inﬂu ences that department’s ability to function optimally and inﬂuence the decisionmaking process involved in effective procurement the lower supply management is on the organizational chart the less likely it is that it can inﬂuence corporate strategy signiﬁcantly in practice the center for advanced purchasing studies caps in a study conducted in  found “the supply organizational structure was forced to be congruent with the overall corporate structure” as opposed to selecting the most appropriate structure for large ﬁrms the importance of supply management in any ﬁrm is determined largely by four factors  availability of materials and services are the major materials and services used by the ﬁrm readily available in a competitive market or are some key materials and services bought in volatile markets that are subject to periodic shortages and price instability if the latter condition prevails creative performance by analytical supply management professionals is required this typically is a toplevel group  absolute dollar volume of purchases if a company spends a large amount of money for materials and services the magnitude of the expenditure means that effective supply management usually can pro duce signiﬁcant proﬁt small unit savings add up quickly when thousands of units are purchased on the service side a contract for it information technology services can run into millions of dollars thus a  percent saving contributes signiﬁcantly to the bottom line  percent of product cost represented by materials and services when a ﬁrm’ s materials and outsourced services costs account for  percent or more of ts total operating budget small reductions n material and service costs increase proﬁt signiﬁcantly wellexecuted supply management usually pays handsome div idends in such companies  types of materials and services purchased perhaps even more important than the preceding consid erations is the amount of control purchasing and supply personnelhave over the availability quality and costs of purchased materials and services most large companies use a wide range of materials and services many of whose price and service arrangements deﬁnitely can be inﬂuenced by creative purchasing per forrnance some ﬁrms n contrast use a fairly small number of standard production and supply materials or services from which even a topﬂight purchasing and supply department can produce little proﬁt through the use of creative management pricing and supplier selection activities in her article “i’m convinced you’ve got value” mary siegfried dozbaba emphasizes the need for pur chasing and supply management departments to demonstrate to the top executive their value and commit ment to improving proﬁtability to attain commitment and respect from the top purchasing and supply management must shift its focus from internal processes to bigpicture issues such as determining and deﬁning the requirements contract negotiation supplier relations and strategic longterm goals of the organization “you need to be willing to let responsibility ﬂow out of the unit purchasing and supply does not need to approve every requisition    stop being the price pouce she says “you want to    be called in to negotiate the multimillion dollar contracts not just to buy pens” such activities will ensure that a purchasing and supply department is favorably positioned to support organizational needs in today’s highly competitive marketplace  michiel r leenders p fraser

purchasing today  no  may  p  chapter  organizational issues  other factors that affect organizational structure classification of responsibilities and activities the starting point in thinking about potential organization structures is a delineation and an analysis of the work to be done by the unit the responsibilities and activities the six classiﬁcations of work in a purchas ing operation are as follows   management management of the purchasing and supply function involves all the tasks associated with the management process with an emphasis on the development of policies procedures controls and the mechanics for coordinating purchasing operations with those of other departments on an exception  basis it also involves the management of unique supplier and commodity problems  buyingsupply management this includes a wide variety of activities such as working with users to help develop requirements and speciﬁcations reviewing requisitions analyzing bids negotiating and selecting suppliers additional responsibilities involve continuing work with a supplier to improve the supplier’s capability and performance in the areas of cost quality and service  contract and relationship management this responsibility ranges from monitoring purchase orders and working with accounts payable to the application of project management skills to a key procurement such as a construction project relationship management is appropriate for many major procurements in which the supplier’s motivation cooperation and collaboration are essential factors in a successful relationship and a successful procurement  strategic planning and research work a welldeveloped purchasing and supply management opera tion has a large number of research projects and systems studies that require specialized knowledge and analytical ability the more an organization has progressed toward a supply management focus the more emphasis it places on these strategic activities the core activities in this area include economic industry and supply market studies the development of buying strategies for material or services buying the de velopment and implementation of supply base and partnering plans product research and value analysis work and operating and information systems analysis  followup and expediting order followup activity involves various types of supplier liaison work such as reviewing the status of orders and occasionally visiting suppliers  clerical activities every department must enter orders and maintain working ﬁles catalogs and library material and records for commodities suppliers prices and so on the precise manner in which purchasing work is subdivided and grouped depends on the size of the department which depends on the size of the company operational versus strategic responsibilities in small ﬁrms responsibilities may be handled by a purchasing or supply manager and one or two assis tants everyone wears several hats in large organizations the department may consist of  to  purchasing and supply professionals in  r david nelson vicepresident of worldwide supply management at deere  co hired  supplier development engineers to accomplish supplier activities resulting in  million in cost savings a major activity or responsibility for any purchasing and supply large multiplant ﬁrms may employ  or more buyers andor engineers  part  the foundation placement of purch rs supplier development responsibilities managing contract and blanket order releases coordinating the procurement systems expediting inbound orders developing longtenn contracts maintaining continuity of supply to production lines developing and integrating supply strategy managing supplier relationships managing risks in supply chain transactionally focused activities strategically focused activities flgura  i operational and strategic characteristics and activities management department is to provide an uninterrupted ﬂow of materials and services the tasks required to accomplish this goal often are referred to as tactical or operational activities these activities are not a great source of cost savings yet are critical in avoiding tremendous losses resulting from potential dis ruptions in operations operational activities offer minimal valueadded beneﬁts yet are often pressing and timeconsuming the focus on such tactical activities results in less time being allocated to proﬁt generating strategic activities figure  demonstrates various operational and strategic characteristics and activities  supply managers have begun to see the need for two types of resources in their organizations  a team of people who manage the operational and tactical activities of purchasing and materials management and  supply managers who are involved in the development of broader strategic aspects of the function those organizations are in a position to separate operational and strategic responsibilities formally in their organizational structures this ability to focus on the strategic sourcing process promises longterm in creased proﬁtable sales and cost savings improving proﬁtability and competitive advantage organizational authority the placement of supply management decisionmaking authority affects the structure of the supply orga nization centralized authority exists when the decisionmaking process is the responsibility of a single person this person is held accountable by top management for the proper performance of purchasing activities decentralization of purchasing authority occurs when personnel from other functional areas— production engineering operations marketing ﬁnance and so on—make unilateral decisions on sources of supply or negotiate with suppliers directly for major purchases as discussed in this book this concept is concerned solely with the placement of purchasing authority it has nothing to do with the location of buying personnel generally in a singlesite operation to decentralize the purchasing function needlessly is to deny a ﬁrm some of its potential proﬁt centralization of the purchasing function is essential for the attainment of both optimum operating efﬁciency and maximum proﬁt most companies today view the centralization of pur chasing as a logical and desirable evolution of frederick taylor’s basic concept of the specialization of labor the extent to which the efficiencies of functional specialization are realized when a ﬁrm creates a supply management department however depends largely on the authority delegated to that department when functioning properly centralized purchasing produces the following beneﬁts  reduction of potential duplication of effort  leveraging of volume purchases volume discounts are possible when all company orders for the same and similar materials are consolidated in addition a ﬁrm is able to project a uniﬁed policy to its sup pliers gaining maximum competitive advantage from its total economic power chapter  organizational issues   consolidation consolidation provides an opportunity to standardize and simplify parts additional beneﬁts can be gained from value analysis and value engineering coordinated through a centralized function  transportation savings transportation savings can be realized through the consolidation of orders and delivery schedules   allowance of specialization centralization develops purchasing specialists whose primary con— cern is purchasing with training purchasing specialists inevitably buy more efﬁciently than lessskilled individuals can  reduction of suppliers’ costs suppliers are able to offer better prices and better service because their expenses are reduced their sales personnel make fewer calls prepare fewer orders make fewer ship— ments prepare fewer invoices and do less recordkeeping  improved inventory control more effective inventory control is possible because of company wide knowledge of stock levels material usage lead times and prices  lower administrative costs fewer orders are processed for the same quantity of goods purchased reducing purchasing receiving inspection accounts payable and recordkeeping expenses  centralized control responsibility for the performance of the purchasing function is placed with a single department head facilitating management control  reduction in the costs of services warren norquist while vice president of materials management at polaroid centralized the purchase of marketing services such as advertising as a direct result of cen tralization polaroid had savings in excess of  percent despite the general advantages of centralization complete centralized purchasing is neither always possible nor always desirable four types of situations justify some decentralization the ﬁrst is found in companies that process single natural raw materials many of those ﬁrms separate the purchase of key raw materials from the purchase of other materials firms in the textile leather food beverage and tobacco industries are good examples in these industries the raw materials are products of nature that are purchased in unstable markets in which prices ﬂuctuate widely buying typically takes place at auctions or through commodity exchanges conducted in small local warehouses in such markets a practical knowledge of grades is as important as knowledge of prices buyers of these commodities usually guard their specialized knowhow with secrecy frequently handing it down from one genera tion to the next a second situation justifying some decentralization of purchasing authority exists in technically oriented ﬁrms that are heavily involved in research in those ﬁrms some exceptions to complete central ization are always desirable many onetime purchases in the research design engineering and related departments can be handled more effectively by professional personnel in those departments moreover the dollar volume of such purchases is usually relatively small the third situation justifying a different type of decentralization is found in the operation of multisite institutional and manufacturing organizations decentralization in this circumstance can allow for a faster response time for the requisitioner a better understanding of the requirements unique to that plant quicker support in product development projects and ownership of the process and products robert monczka robert trent and robert handﬁeld purchasing and supply chain management rd ed mason oh south westem  pp —  part i the foundation fifth the purchase of nontechmcal oddsand ends often calls for a partial decentralization of purchas ing credit card and petty cash fund purchases of less than several hundred dollars are a good example decentralizing through the use of these approaches can be a money saver the danger of losing purchasing control does not stem from partial decentralization of the purchas ing function per se some decentralization is necessary as a matter of common sense the use of cross functional teams in the decisionmaking process is increasing organizations are changing to compete in the global market companies are seeking to take advantage of both structures by forming a hybrid structure that includes both centralized and decentralized decision making this results in the best of both structures maintaining necessary control while meeting the unique needs of the other functions or divisions ecommerce technology has provided a solution to the debate about centralized versus decentralized organizational structures as computers began to appear on desktops in the late  purchasing departments were able to reduce administrative time and costs by placing purchase orders electronically electronic data inter change edi was the early stage of ecommerce electronic catalogs of approved supplies or services could be created through a centralized supply management department and disseminated to decentralized loca tions for purchase electronic billing and remittance of invoices improved cash ﬂow while reducing the cost of doing business ecommerce allowed corporate policy and procedure to be distributed and monitored effectively while giving divisional supply management departments the authority to make purchases to meet their local requirements ecommerce has been a catalyst enabling organizations to beneﬁt from the hybrid supply management structure organizational structures as was stated above the position of the supply management department on a ﬁrm’s organizational chart can vary however as materials gained in importance becoming a larger proportion of the cost of goods sold issues such as inﬂated inventories poor quality material stockouts long lead times and miscommu nications provided the impetus for a movement to capture control of materials under one individual this gave rise to the materials management approach to structuring the material portion of an organization the materials management organization the concept of organizing the functions that affect the acquisition movement and storage of materials un der one manager evolved in the early s the term materials management was introduced to describe an integrated systems approach to the coordination of materials activities and the control of total material  costs the purchasing planning and scheduling transportation and warehousing functions were orga nized under the control and responsibility of one individual the materials manager the objective was to optimize the performance of the materials system as opposed to suboptimizing the performance of the individual functions that are parts of the materials system the results were “great improvements in inven tory levels customer service and communications ultimately improving the bottom line“ for the classic reference see dean s ammer materials management and purchasing th ed homewood il richard d irwin  marilyn gettinger “strategic thinking movin’ on up from supply management to the supply chain lst annual international supply management conference ism tempe az may  p  chapter  organizational issues  the materials management organization was popular during the s and s this concept of integrating the functions involved in the management of materials paved the way for the more sophisticated concept of supply and supply chain management the supply chain management structure in the late s japan invaded the us automobile market with cars assembled in japan this marked the beginning of globalization as we know it today the early s saw the appearance of personal com puters on the desktops of organizations putting data and information at the ﬁngertips of managers with the introduction of the internet and the world wide web the

organizational structure is ﬁnding a structure that will allow the organization’s supply chain to function effectively and efﬁciently ism professor of supply chain management robert m monczka tells us in “finding a structure that works” “establishing appropriate organizational struc ture and governance processes for the supply management function is critical to effective supply chain management

crossfunctional teams synergy the many activities identiﬁed in this chapter have one thing in common they all beneﬁt from a variety of functional inputs for example during the new product development process marketing has informa tion on customers’ wants and needs their willingness to purchase at different prices and present and potential competition design engineering has knowledge about current and future design processes and constraints manufacturing engineering has information on the ﬁrm’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing processes and their limitations supply management provides a window to the supply world and its capa bilities and limitations and the likely cost and availability of various materials and services under consid eration customer service quality ﬁnance information technology and carefully selected suppliers all have many additional contributions to make during the new product development process when these professionals come together under a capable team leader the result is normally a synergy that results in a far more proﬁtable new product far more quickly than would have occurred with the traditional sequential approach to new product development ”many of the ideas in this appendix were introduced by one of the authors mentors professor norman maier of the university of michigan during the mid  part  the foundation input from all affected functions  the crossfunctional approach greatly increases the likelihood that all issues that should be considered will be addressed for example customer support and service frequently were overlooked in the traditional se quential approach to new product development standardization efforts which are conducted or controlled by a single functional area such as manufacturing engineering frequently overlook the procurement man ufacturing and marketing implications of implementing new standards the result is surplus purchased materials manufacturing bottlenecks or products that do not compete in the marketplace  time compression a hypothetical example may help in understanding the traditional sequential or functional approach to many of the activities discussed above marketing at alpha corporation has identiﬁed a need for a new complex transducer marketing describes this need to design engineering which designs the transducer on completion of the design the speciﬁcations and drawings are forwarded to manufacturing engineer ing the function responsible for translating design engineering’s speciﬁcations into production plans manufacturing engineering determines that certain tolerances cannot be met by the ﬁrm’s production equipment design engineering is asked to revise the speciﬁcations design engineering contacts market ing to determine what impact the revised tolerances ones which the ﬁrm’s equipment can meet will have on sales if the impact is signiﬁcant manufacturing and possibly plant engineering may become involved they may decide that new equipment is required this processcontinues on through the quality assurance function quality assurance reviews the speciﬁcations and production plans to ensure that the required level of quality will be obtainable the customer service function then reviews the speciﬁcations and manufacturing plans so that it can develop plans to support the transducers n the ﬁeld obviously each function along the sequential path leading to production of the desired transducer may question or even challenge the design speciﬁcations and manufacturing plans this backandforth process ultimately leads to a product that is late to market and overpriced i overcoming organizational resistance with the crossfunctional approach all functional areas are involved up front and this helps reduce orga nizational resistance to decisions that will affect speciﬁc functional areas in contrast decisions that affect multiple functional areas thatare made without the involvement of those areas are likely to meet resis— tance the representatives of each of the functional areas involved on the team constructively provide their input and are involved in the resulting agreement in turn each representative is responsible for ensuring acceptance by his or her functional area of the team’s decisions experience indicates that once a team makes a decision implementation of the resulting plan is much easier and faster than is the case with the sequential approach  enhanced problem resolution the crossfunctional team approach is far more efﬁcient and effective at solving problems than the tradi tional functional one is for example if a supplier in spite of its best efforts is unable to meet the contract schedule or quality requirements a crossfunctional team representing supply management manufacturing engineering and quality may be formed to work with the supplier to resolve the problem the solution to a surprising number of such problems is within the customer ﬁrm’s control not the supplier’s chapter  organizational issues  negotiations negotiations for critical or largemonetaryvalue materials services supplies or items of equipment are conducted much more effectively by a wellprepared and well—coordinated crossfunctional team than by the ﬁnest supply professionals alone improved communication and cooperation the traditional functional approach to the activities listed in the opening paragraph of this appendix nor mally results in efﬁciency within each department however this approach inhibits communication and cooperation among the departments involved in the activities some  years ago one of the authors was the chief procurement ofﬁcer cpo of a relatively small business unit the organization’s plant engineering department designed speciﬁcations for construction projects those speciﬁcations served as the basis of invitations for bids ifbs and the resulting contracts numerous questions and problems were encountered with potential suppliers during the bidding process and then with the successful bidder the speciﬁcations were ambiguous and in several cases contained inconsistencies  the cpo met with the plant engineer and offered to become involved in the development and review of the speciﬁcations the plant engineer rejected the offer stating “development of speciﬁcations is my responsibility butt out interestingly the plant engineer subsequently expressed his desire to become involved in the sourcing process guess what happened challenges and problems with the crossfunctional approach there are several challenges and inherent problems with a crossfunctional approach additional investment in scarce resources a single professional normally requires far fewer labor hours to accomplish a task than does a team for example a single supply management professional can accomplish the many actions involved in selecting a critical supplier in considerably fewer labor hours than can a crossfunctional sourcing team however a team consisting of a design engineer a manufacturing engineer and a quality engineer together with a supply professional will do a far more thorough job of selecting the right source role conflict normally crossfunctional team assignments impose additional duties on many or all of the individuals in volved in many cases a team member’s functional manager expects that individual to perform his or her normal functional responsibilities such responsibilities require about  hours per week and the individ ual also is expected to satisfy his or her team responsibilities a number of years ago one of the authors directed thesis research at the graduate logistics division of the air force institute of technology the research focused on minimizing role conflict between functional and team assignments the subjects were assigned to crossfunctional teams developing the b bomber the researchers focused on a multimatrix approach to project management as a means of avoiding or minimizing the inherent role conﬂict while promising the research results were inconclusive some  years later management is still attempting to cope with the issue of role conﬂict resulting from parttime assignment of individuals to crossftmctional teams despite these issues the beneﬁts of teams usually outweigh the resulting problems  part  the foundation overload for key team members overload is an obvious result of the role conﬂict inherent in the additional duties assigned to key team members paradoxically the most attractive team members are those individuals who are key contributors to their functional organizations management must be sensitive to the danger of such an overload to avoid burnout and the possible loss of such individuals gentlnulty obviously once team members have been trained and developed and have learned to work together in a synergistic manner continuity of membership becomes critical retirement departure to another ﬁrm pro motions and layoffs can have a negative impact on the team’s operation careful selection and assignment of team members can reduce but not eliminate such problems rewards by now it should be apparent that individuals who are assigned to crossfunctional teams as an additional duty should be rewarded appropriately the greatest reward is the satisfaction associated with “making a difference” in the team’s success senior professional managers ensure that functional managers the chief procurement ofﬁcer the director of rd the director of manufacturing etc recognize all individuals’ contributions to both their functional organizations and the crossfunctional team a few enlightened organizations have had success with team incentives these incentives range from team dinners to a team vacation in hawaii to the award of stock options in some cases the team receives a bundle of rewards such as  stock options the team members then allocate the options according to a consensus of the members on the relative contribution of each member more information on this subject may be found in rewarding teams lessons from the trenches prerequisites to successful grossfunctional teams although there are many prerequisites we will focus on three especially critical ones executive sponsorship an absolute prerequisite for successful crossfunctional teams is the support of an executive sponsor “top management team support and political factors may be even more critical to the success of crossfunctional teams than the internal team processes the individual sponsor should have all the functional areas involved reporting to him or her or have the informal ability to secure the cooperation and support of colleagues in obtaining the assignment of the appropriate human resources to the project additionally the executive sponsor must track the crossfunctional team’s progress run interference and obtain additional resources as appropriate glen parket jerry mcadams and david zielinski

become lost ﬂounder get off course lose sight of their goal lose conﬁdence become mired in interpersonal conﬂicts stop short of their goal and never contribute their full potential surveys of highly effective teams have shown that their members rated their leaders as highly skilled lowerperforming teams rated their leaders as being much less effective ideally a team leader has people skills communication skills technical knowledge experience working with the people who will be on the team and enthusiasm the new role of the team leader is to build a team with vision authority accountability information skills and a commitment to assuming more and better operational control of the team’s work the new leader expands the capabilities of the team members and the team itself as a result the team can perform some of the leader’s traditional work roles such as budgeting scheduling setting performance goals and providing training the team gradually assumes the daytoday operations allowing the leader to manage resources ideas technolo gies and the work processes the most challenging aspect of this new role is that the leader must give up part of his or her former more authoritarian role such a shift of roles gives the leader more time to take on strategic roles the result of the shift is that the team is able to contribute more and with greater speed  team leaders must assume a number of roles they must understand people so that they can inﬂu ence them they should encourage and maintain open communication and help the team develop and follow team norms the team leader needs to step back from his or her management role of directing employees and assume a more collaborative role as a facilitator the leader should help guide the team and allow the team to identify problems develop solutions and then implement those solutions the team members must be free to express themselves as long as that expression is not destructive in nature the team leader should support the expression of conﬂicting points of view “team synergy begs for a conﬂict of ideas conﬂict can bring into being the creative tension where paradigmshifting ideas are born” while the team leader may need to retain some of the final decision making in the early stages it should be the leader’s goal to develop the team so that it can assume responsibility for the decision making entirely  the team leader helps the team focus on the task and removes obstacles that stand in the way of the team’s performance helping the team focus will ensure that the team progresses through productive stages of team development and will reduce the tendency for it to revert to one of the less productive stages effective team leaders help minimize turf issues and keep the team focused on the good of the organiza tion additionally the leader needs to make sure that the team members have all the resources they need so that they don’t become distracted the team leader also should remove any obstacles to the team’s success additionally team leaders help establish a vision create change and unleash talent the leader helps the team establishla mission statement and deﬁne its goals leaders create change within both the orga nization and the team they force people to think outside the box and help develop creative solutions to problems leaders need to have good people skills to identify and draw out the hidden talents of the team members former american league relief pitcher david baldwin writing in the harvard business review addresses the issue of “blame” he focuses on how managers in major league baseball employ blame ”tom schulte quoted in “conﬂict resolution a required skill for engineering team managers iomas report on managing design engineering january  p   part ‘i the foundation baldwin contends that blame plays an important role in shaping an organization’s culture he proposes ﬁve important rules of blame which we believe apply to most or all team leaders

casualty of blame mega» meetings do’s don’ts and donuts lighthouse point press  offers the following suggestions to team leaders i decide whether a meeting is the best way to accomplish this consider circulating routine informa tion via email if a meeting is required distribute an agenda at least two days in advance state in one or two sentences what you would like your meeting to accomplish set ground rules to maintain focus respect and order during the meeting take responsibility for the outcome of the meeting for example help keep the meeting on track and help resolve conﬂicts i if your meeting isn’t working try other tools such as brainstorming techniques or computer software that help you create the agenda qualified team members experience indicates that the most critical variable in one’s ability to be a “high” contributor is willingness and desire to contribute baxter health care of paramatta new south wales australia ensures that team members are “willing” participantsby announcing forthcoming team projects to all employees individuals are encouraged to volunteer for the additional assignments as team members representing their functional areas in many cases competition for a team position is intense thus the team leader is in the enviable position of being able to select members from a pool of volunteers obviously team membership has the potential for satisfaction and intrinsic and tangible rewards at baxter the wisconsin department of revenue has identiﬁed the following communication skills as being signiﬁcant to employee success if an individual

leader and having wellqualiﬁed team members are two critical ﬁrst steps the third step is team development and training this calls for investments that should pay a high return for example southern california edison sce has used team development and training to create one of the best supply management systems in the utility industry under the leadership of emiko banﬁeld  crossfunctional supply management teams have been established to manage supply issues each sce team receives three days of team develop ment and training as a foundation for its activities as a result sce has taken over  million out of a spend of approximately  billion working through cross functional teams banﬁeld discovered that internal barriers could be reduced setting the stage for successful collaboration if teams were trained properly the supply chain management institute at the university of san diego is pioneering an alternative approach to team development fourperson crossfunctional teams from client ﬁrms undergo interactive training on selected supply management topics a onehour workshop is conducted after each onehour training module during the workshop each team conducts a gap analysis comparing one of its processes with the worldclass processes presented in the previous training module the team then develops a preliminary action plan to close the gap the plan identiﬁes key actions a time line and an estimate of the bottomline impact of the team’s proposed plan preliminary ﬁndings indicate that cohesive teams evolve with this approach to training and organizational transformation although the ﬁndings are preliminary this approach to team development appears to be very cost effective  lgo’shea ”relationshipbuilding skills” p  oemiko banﬁeld harnessing value in the supply chain new york john wiley  sons  pp —  r  part  the foundation adequate time unrealistic deadlines are major problems that block the success of many crossfunctional teams as burt and pinkerton wrote “too much pressure for results too soon will almost always force a team to prema ture and less effective decisions” the tendency for management to act now rather than allowing time for good analysis is an old habit in the united states many of america’s global competitors have the patience to take time to nurture participative management the results of nurturing participative management are well known just ask american automotive manufacturers about the cost of quick reactions without fos tering participation”  interfirm teams when buying and supplying organizations recognize the interdependence and the beneﬁts to both parties of a collaborative or alliance relationship the development of an interfirm team should be considered in effect a superordinate crossfunctional team will result dan mohr director of supplier relations for gte observes “relationship teams are the building blocks upon which the relationship prospers team meetings provide a forum to jointly discuss new ways to reduce process costs improve service to our cus tomers and enhance time to market which ultimately expands market share for both organizations” as with crossfunctional teams within each ﬁrm the assignment of the “right” individuals and team training are essential for success one signiﬁcant difference is that two executive sponsors will be required one at each ﬁrm the interﬁrm team’s ﬁrst task after receiving appropriate training is the development of a cus tomized effective and efﬁcient communication system as we will see in the chapter on relationships many progressive organizations are working with se lected collaborative suppliers to develop and manage supply alliances one of the keys to success with such efforts is the development and use of interfirm teams experience indicates that the basis of such interﬁrm teams must be the existence of crossfunctional teams at both the buying and the supplying organizations the development and use of interﬁrm teams is more challenging than are inhouse crossfunctional teams but the beneﬁts are even greater supply management’s roles on grossfunctional teams timothy m laseter vice president boozallen  harmton
