traditional loans investors overview trust deed investments mortgage fund brokers overview about us overview mission  vision our team contact contact us home investors investors overview here at aegis funding our trust deeds are secured against real estate assets with a protective equity position difference in value to loan amount  what this means to investors is in the unlikely event that we have to foreclose on a home the proceeds collected on resale would be sufficient to pay all interest due to investors all fees and real estate commissions  our investors are seeing performing returns from  annually  we the founders of aegis invest heavily in these products and we underwrite every loan as if we were funding it personally  if you or anyone you know is interested in learning more about trust deed investing contact us today    we also have a mortgage pool aegis asset backed securities llc   if youre considering investing in trust deeds but desire more diversification liquidity and flexibility a mortgage pool investment could be right for you much like a mutual fund a mortgage pool is a portfolio of real estate loans funded collectively by multiple investors each purchasing shares in the pool interest payments are paid out proportionately as monthly dividends by allowing an investor to spread their investment across all the loans in the fund mortgage pools offer greater diversification than investing in individual trust deeds   benefits of mortgage pool investing   diversification by allowing an investor to share in multiple trust deeds mortgage pool investing provides significant diversification within the investors trust deed position  further reducing risk   convenience mortgage pools allow investors to invest in multiple trust deeds with the bookkeeping convenience of a single investment whats more there is no need to reinvest capital returned when loans are paid off  its automatically reinvested in new loans as long as your investment in the fund remains active this is one reason that a mortgage pool can be a great option for self directed iras – we have excellent resources for selfdirected custodians   dividend reinvestment because monthly interest payments are distributed to shareholders as dividends investors have the option to reinvest their yields automatically and compound their investment   liquidity investment in individual trust deeds are locked in until the loan matures  but shares of a mortgage pool can typically be sold at any time after  months after the initial investment date  in special circumstances we are able to
