wearbyleilaon october  i love these boots in the abstract so it pains me to rate them so poorly but not as much as wearing them pains me i would rate them one star except the quality is excellent both of materials  construction the fit is terrible i have a pretty average standard size  foot these boots somehow manage to be both too small  too large at the same time the back heelankle area is so loose the boots flop off in the back every time i take a step yet the front toe box area is pinchy  narrow where everyones foot is widest these boots are loud  you will never sneak up on anyone in fact the clomping is enough to aggravate you alone the height of the boot around the leg is extremely awkward it hits me right below the fullest part of my calf so the boots never look right with jeans tucked in as they give you a sort of misguided cowgirl effect and youll have to dig out some full boot cuts to wear jeans over them plus a waste since looks like shoes then since they are thick under jeans its a lot of money to spend for something that works so poorly for me id hoped they would become a go to favorite but every time i test walk them on a jaunt with the dog i come home  take them off will be trying to unload these in a resale site  im unhappy i couldnt enjoy them more read more sort by topmost recenttopfilter by all reviewersverified purchase onlyverified purchase onlyall
