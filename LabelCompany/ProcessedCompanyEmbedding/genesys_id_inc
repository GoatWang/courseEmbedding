own this is i am sure you understand very different from the products they resell from china were they have the factory print their logo on you do know anyone can do this for a minimum quantity order you quoted from the company propaganda that experts in embedded biometric technology this would leave a person to think they are the engineers and developers of biometric technology can you please name one product they have made a product they own the op on a product that is theres exclusively the pill box we know was brought from the chinese factory that made it originally as a pistol safe it is a product owned by the chinese who sell it to anyone just check out ali baba i have seen all the other so called products they have listed readily available for purchase from china manufacturers so what have they made or as a little due diligence research will show they are just a reseller of others products to call themselves experts in embedded biometric products is beyond laughable i am truly
