parks and pumas…and prionsproduct type science featureyear authors hunter dsuggested citation hunter d  people parks and pumas…and prions the puma or mountain lion ranks as colorado’s top predator and one of rocky mountain national park’s most charismatic species for more than a decade park managers have wanted to conduct research on this elusive animal how many of these big cats live in the park what do they eat is the population stable or declining is the park a source of cat immigration into nearby boulder county are there safety concerns that aren’t being addressed and recently the question arose to whether these big cats prefer deer that are infected with chronic wasting disease cwd a deadly disease spread by malformed proteins called prions that is do mountain lions selectively prey on infected deer and act as a natural control to the spread of the disease a behavior that would support the old theories of natural selection these are but a few of the questions that will be answered over the coming years as researchers led by the colorado division of wildlife cdow and usgsfort collins science center fort begin to reveal the ecological story of the park’s
