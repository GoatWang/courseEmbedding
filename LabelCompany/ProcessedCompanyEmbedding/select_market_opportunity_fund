can be a daunting task and sometimes economic climates break with tradition making investment decisions even more arduous these situations have historically offered opportunities for patient shareholders to increase their exposure in great companies our goal with the market strength allocation opportunity portfolio is to invest in undervalued companies with strong market positions that have the following qualities strong balance sheets skilled management highly liquid ability to generate earnings growth and record of financial strength and profit growth portfolio objective the objective of this unit investment trust is to provide investors the potential for aboveaverage capital appreciation however there is no assurance the objective will be met the portfolio terminates approximately two years from the initial date of deposit portfolio selection process this unit investment trust will invest in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of companies that exhibit financial strength from five distinct segments of the market the five market segments will be weighted based on the adjacent allocation through our selection process we seek to find the companies that we believe have the best prospects for aboveaverage capital appreciation identify the universe the first step in our selection process is to identify each universe from which we will select the stocks for the five market segments each universe contains stocks selected specifically for each component of the allocation screen for financial strength the next step in our process is to evaluate companies based on multiple factorsthese factors are designed to identify those stocks which exhibit strong fundamental characteristics and to eliminate those that do not meet our investment criteria examine historical financial results the next step in our process is to look for those companies that have earned a net cash flow return on investment that is above the average of their peershistorically companies that have increased their cash flows at a higher rate have rewarded shareholders with superior total returns select companies with attractive valuations the final step in our process is to select companies based on the fundamental analysis of our team of research analyststhe stocks selected for the portfolio are those that meet our investment objective trade at attractive valuations and in our opinion are likely to exceed market expectations of future cash flows not fdic insured  not bank guaranteed  may lose value you should consider the portfolios investment objective risks and charges and expenses carefully before investing contact your financial advisor or call first trust portfolios lp at  to request a prospectus which contains this and other information about the portfolio read it carefully before you invest risk considerations an investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an understanding of the risks involved with owning common stocks such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market you should be aware that the portfolio is concentrated in stocks in both the consumer products and information technology sectors which involves additional risks including limited diversification the companies engaged in the consumer products industry are subject to global competition changing government regulations and trade policies currency fluctuations and the financial and political risks inherent in producing products for foreign markets the companies engaged in the information technology sector are subject to fierce competition high research and development costs and their products and services may be subject to rapid obsolescence technology company stocks especially those which are internetrelated may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to their operating performance an investment in a portfolio containing equity securities of foreign issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller less liquid less regulated and more volatile than the us and developed foreign markets an investment in a portfolio containing smallcap and midcap companies is subject to additional risks as the share prices of smallcap companies and certain midcap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors including limited trading volumes products financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information although this portfolio terminates in approximately  months the strategy is longterm investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios if available there may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an ira or other qualified plan the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers     product watch
