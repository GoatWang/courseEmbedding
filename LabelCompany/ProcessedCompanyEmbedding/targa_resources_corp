therefore a negative tax rate to reflect the tax benefit the negative tax rate that is estimated on a fullyear basis is applied to our first quarter loss so the first quarter reflects income tax expense rather than benefit we currently estimate that the first quarter income tax expense will be more than offset by income tax benefit over the remainder of the yearnet income attributable to
