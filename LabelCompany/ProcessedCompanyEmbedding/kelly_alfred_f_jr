feed twitter facebook march   william o’shaughnessy interviews alfred f kelly jr william o’shaughnessy president  editorial director wvox and wvip interview with  alfred f kelly jr president  ceo nynj super bowl host company super bowl xlviii february     alfred f kelly jr ran super bowl xlviii in  the very first outdoorcold weather gridiron classic in nfl history  he was a former president of american express and as a young man had a very important post in the reagan white house  we spoke of his catholic faith his friendship with cardinal dolan and his westchester family  kelly has been a class act in every season  and he’s only  although the legendary sportswriter jimmy cannon once called sports “the toys of a nation” football which resembles sanctioned violence our westchester neighbor commissioner roger goodell will forgive me has appeal for many of our neighbors  million watched the extravaganza hosted by kelly and his nynj super bowl associates we were flattered that just a few weeks after the big event he came by his homet own station for this interview  we talked of many things – besides football  al kelly is quite a guy as you will see … william o’shaughnessy good morning westchester … it’s what the brits would call a “brilliant day” here in our home heath of westchester  for the next several minutes while we’re in your care and keeping – we have someone i’ve been looking forward to interviewing for a long time  you’ve read about him in the public press  this is his home heath as well new rochelle  he grew up around here  he’s an iona guy  he was an elder of iona college  he has enormous influence around that campus because he raises a lot of money for them  but in recent years he had a career change  you may have known him as the president of a small tiny little company called american express … amex the huge credit card company – where he served for many years as president with our new rochelle neighbor ken chenault husband of kathryn chenault  his name is alfred f kelly jr  and recently – you must know this – he’s been running the super bowl  al kelly … are you glad you did it al kelly good morning bill  it’s a pleasure to be with you and the folks of westchester county  i’m delighted i did it  it was a wonderful event for this region  considering the fact that super bowls have been played for almost five decades and th of the national football league is in this region and calls this region home in my mind it was high time this great game for american sports came to the greatest area in america and i think we put on a terrific show … this region has so much to offer   it was really my pleasure to really play a bit of a “maestro” role in bringing tens of thousands of people together to make it a success  but we’re really pleased with the way it went william o’shaughnessy was it a success al kelly al kelly i do believe it was bill … on all accounts  it was the most watched television show in television history  william o’shaughnessy how many people al kelly  million people  it beat the super bowl of three years ago when the giants beat the patriots by a few points  one of the reasons it did so well on television despite the fact it wasn’t a terribly competitive game was because we were able to create an atmosphere where this really was – in this area – almost like either the giants or jets or both were playing in it  and the reality is we had a  share in this market where a typical super bowl where the giants or jets are not in would get a  share  and that’s because we got the region fired up about this great opportunity there was a  increase in the number of credentialed media that followed this game   credentialed media came to the super bowl and super bowl week  one of the things i looked at from the very beginning – as did the tisch mara and johnson families – was that we wanted to take this platform of the super bowl and make sure we did some good for the community  typically a host committee would struggle to raise a million dollars for a single project  we have raised almost  million dollars and we have initiated or completed or have in progress over  projects on both sides of the hudson river all aimed at schoolage youth and facilities they use after school … in the evenings … on the weekends and in the summers  we did a playground in white plains a brandnew playground from scratch  we have done community center renovations  we put new ball fields in place  and these are things bill that are going to last for decades  and my hope is that people are going to say that in  the super bowl was played here and this field this community center this playground we are enjoying today – five ten fifteen years later – came about because of the super bowl being here  that “legacy” element is the most gratifying work we’ve done william o’shaughnessy alfred kelly jr … you’re working for the maras … and i’m reminded that wellington mara of sainted memory sat right at that very microphone several times … and also the tischs and woody johnson of the jets  how’s that different from working for a board of directors of amex where once you presided al kelly well interestingly enough this is a job where i don’t think i’ve ever had more bosses new yorknew jersey host company is a company  in addition to being ceo i was chairman of a board that had eight members on it  the owners couldn’t be members of it because we were a “notforprofit” organization and the giants and jets are “for profit” organizations  so we actually had an “advisory committee” where i met with the owners once a month  william o’shaughnessy were they easy to deal with al kelly they were terrific  i have to say they were perfect bosses  they were there when i needed them  they largely left me to do my thing  we called upon them tremendously as far as appearances  i had them at many breakfasts cocktails parties and unless they were traveling they would never say no  i couldn’t have asked for more  i knew the maras and i knew john tisch a bit  i didn’t know the rest of the tisch family and i didn’t know woody johnson before i got into this and they really have been a real pleasure to deal with  interestingly enough john tisch and woody johnson who were the cochairs of this were both born in new jersey and today live in manhattan  and for them to share a new yorknew jersey super bowl was important to them personally because this was their home area and the fact they were able to show off their terrific new stadium to the world also gave them a real sense of pride  and it is a beautiful facility they’ve built william o’shaughnessy alfred kelly jr head of the super bowl do you think there will ever be another one around here al kelly obviously it’s one of the smallest elitist clubs in the world the  owners of the national football league  they determine where the super bowls go  and as of the current bylaws in the league  a  it can only be in a region where there is an nfl franchise  and b bill there is this rule that the commissioner allowed a onetime pass on which a super bowl can only be held in a region where there’s an average temperature in february of at least  degrees  so obviously that was waived even though we got pretty darn close to  degrees on february nd  william o’shaughnessy you were bailed out by the weatherman  what if we had a blizzard  would you be scrambling now to explain the weather al kelly well from the beginning two things i knew i couldn’t control were the weather and who was going to play in the game and thus determine the competitiveness of the game  despite the fact that a lot of people paid a lot of attention to the weather i never really worried about it per se  i just made sure we were prepared  we had great cooperation from governor christie and governor cuomo and mayor bloomberg and then mayor deblasio who came in and was incredibly supportive in his early days in office  we have great assets in this region  we know how to clear snow  in fact both governors and the mayor were prepared to prioritize where the snow removal happened based upon the day of the week in super bowl week and what events were happening and where they were happening  truthfully bill it would have taken the wrong storm at exactly the wrong time to impact the game because typically even in a blizzard we have a period of eight to ten hours where we’re paralyzed  but after that you could start to get it cleared out  there have been a couple of times this winter where it started to snow at  in the morning and it snowed until  at night   obviously that kind of day would have been a problem  but i invited cardinal dolan a good friend of my wife peggy and me about six months before … and  i gave him the assignment of praying for good weather  unfortunately the cardinal ultimately couldn’t come to the game but i think the fact that if he’s ever up for sainthood i’ll be able to say that he had a miracle by creating the best day in  to date including today which was february nd william o’shaughnessy i just got a note from him this week his eminence will claim credit for this you know how he operates al kelly and he should … i’m happy to give it to him william o’shaughnessy his name is alfred f kelly jr … he’s a westchester guy lives in rye with his wife peggy  didn’t you two fall in love right in our backyard here al kelly we did  i grew up in the crestwood section of yonkers  peggy grew up in port chester  i actually met her at her senior prom at holy child where she was … william o’shaughnessy was she with somebody else … al kelly she was with somebody else  i was a year older a freshman at iona college after four years at iona prep  she was going to iona college … so i was introduced to her at the prom and six months later in december of  i took her to an iona college basketball game and that was our first date and we dated for seven years and september of last year we were married for  years so we’ve been together quite a while … william o’shaughnessy and you have a few children al kelly we do we have five children  our two boys are graduates of iona prep  our two girls are graduates of the school of the holy child where i happen to be chairman of the board of trustees  and believe it or not we have this incredible gift of a fourth grader who is ten years younger than our fourth child and  years younger than our oldest child and she is an absolute gift from the good lord and she keeps us as young as can be  she is a fourth grader at resurrection school in rye  william o’shaughnessy al kelly jr you’re what i used to call a “castle irishman” it’s a term of admiration it’s not a pejorative term  you remind me of another son of westchester … jim comey he’s got five kids  and what does comey do  he’s head of the fbi  is this a roman thing … you’ve got to have five kids  kelly … and comey  or the plunketts al kelly i don’t know … i’m the oldest of seven  we never really set out when we were engaged or in our early years of marriage with a particular number of children in mind  it is what it is  there was no plan for us vis a vis children  but we have five terrific kids  the older four have gone to … boston college and we’ve had four bc graduates  father lahey their president told me our fourth grader is already accepted into the class of   william o’shaughnessy so your faith – the catholic faith of the roman church – means a lot to you  al kelly it does  i grew up … my parents still live in the crestwood section of yonkers my dad goes to mass every single day at annunciation in crestwood  i can’t quite be that loyal  it does mean a lot to me  i’m very fond of our current cardinal and he has me extraordinarily involved in the board of trustees of saint joseph’s seminary  i am on the finance council of the archdiocese of new york  i’m the vice president of the new york catholic foundation  so he’s a hard guy to say no to  i have a lot of faith in him and a lot of faith in our church  it is an important part of my life william o’shaughnessy al kelly who better to ask  what do you think of the new pope  i can’t get enough of the guy … al kelly i do think he’s been an incredible breath of fresh air  one of the challenges the church has is that it has lost a great deal of people  not necessarily to other faiths or other churches … just the fact that they’ve lost them  i think they can be brought back and i think pope francis has been a real evangelist and i happen to think cardinal dolan has that similar personality  and quite frankly bill not enough priests have this evangelistic personality and objective where they really need to understand the church is about the people and we need to have the people there for the church to be vibrant  i think that message the pope is sending is that we need people back and involved in the church and i think he’s done a wonderful job of setting tone in his first year as pope  william o’shaughnessy alfred kelly … mario cuomo … father of our present governor andrew cuomo was rooting for your friend cardinal dolan to be pope  did you ever talk to the cardinal and say did you want the job al kelly well i think he like many people in that position would do whatever you are asked much like our incredible young women and men who serve in the military  i’ve gotten a chance to witness some of these people in this role of running the super bowl  these people are incredibly selfless and do what they’re needed to do and go where they need to go and i think people like cardinal dolan will do what is necessary and what is right  and if the wisdom of the other  cardinals would be that he should be the pope i think he would gladly embrace that  if the wisdom is that he should be the head of the archdiocese of new york he would be happy doing that as well  that’s one of the great things about him he’s living in the moment  william o’shaughnessy alfred kelly jr … i don’t want to patronize you but you have neighbors … in scarsdale bronxville rye and bedford … places with a lot of “yuppie” hedge fund guys who take and give nothing back  do you and peggy ever get kind of discouraged when you look around you … at the lack of manners … the lack of involvement  the selfishness al kelly we do what we do and we don’t look around at others or judge other people  i think both of us feel extraordinarily blessed  i’ve had success from a combination of hard work and good fortune and our big things are healthcare and catholic education and that’s the real core or our focus from a charity perspective bill  it’s something we believe if we’ve had some good fortune we should try to help other people where we can william o’shaughnessy second time i’ve mentioned him but mario cuomo said he prays for “sureness”  your catholic faith you’ve spoken eloquently of it this morning … are you … sure … about all this  al kelly you have to have faith  without it it kind of leaves a void  does that mean our church is perfect  it’s far from it  and it has its warts like every other or many other organizations do and i think one of the things pope francis is trying to do is deal with some of those warts  whether you look at the lack of men going into the priesthood …  i don’t know what it’s going to be like for my kids  who is going to say mass on sunday  i know there are many more priests retiring every year than there are being ordained and obviously it’s just mathematics  so that certainly is a concern for me william o’shaughnessy did you ever think about being a priest al kelly i never did no  i don’t know why  it is a calling … but it is not something i’ve thought about  william o’shaughnessy al kelly jr we’ve roamed far and wide  let’s get away from your soul and your church for the moment and your friend the cardinal … and go back to the super bowl which you ran in every telling and in every account brilliantly  what’s next  you also ran that little company american express which has been so good to me in every season  aren’t you also a director of hershey and a big insurance company al kelly well i am not currently on the hershey board anymore but i am on the board of met life and  recently in january i joined the board of visa in san francisco and i’m on the board of new york presbyterian hospital where i spend a fair amount of time  i think it’s a phenomenal facility and phenomenal organization  i don’t know what’s next bill  i’m going to take the next six – eight weeks and help them get things cleaned up and closed down bills to pay reports to write tax returns to file audits to complete  and then i want to take some time  i’m not looking to jump into anything  i have to decide if i want to go back into a big corporate job or do a portfolio of things  the thing i know for sure is i want to work full time it’s just a matter of whether i piece together four or five or six different things that role up to a full time role  or whether i take a full time role in corporate america  i also have to decide how strongly i feel about going back into financial services which is kind of where i have the most experience  but it certainly has become an incredibly regulated industry   william o’shaughnessy football … al kelly  i once had a conversation … again i summon the name of well mara of sainted memory  i once asked mr mara  isn’t it really sanctioned violence  you seem like a nice gentle guy  are you uncomfortable when you see them get knocked around and flattened on the field al kelly these folks are in incredible shape  i’ve had the good fortune of  watching a couple of nfl games from the field and from that angle and perspective bill you really see how fast and tough the game is  i think it’s one of the challenges and commissioner goodell talked about it  one of the challenges for the  league is how to make sure these young men who play the game are as protected as they can possibly be  but on the other hand the roughness the toughness of it is part of the attractiveness of the game  i have to say that although i’m a football fan i’m probably a college basketball fan more than anything else  i didn’t take this job because of this dying love for football – or even of sports – i took this job because of a love for this region of the country where i grew up and seeing that this incredible ultimate football game could be a catalyst for economic benefit tourism charitable legacy work for this region and galvanize people around the super bowl much more than just watching a football game  and that’s what got me excited about this opportunity and has me feeling good about it now that it is over william o’shaughnessy flash … i’ve got a thought  have you ever thought … al kelly jr … about politics al kelly there was a time bill … probably as little as ten years ago when i did  my father dabbled in it a little bit in yonkers … william o’shaughnessy what did he do al kelly he ran for the local city council in yonkers  i have to admit i’ve been quite turned off quite honestly  to fix it we almost would need a wave of people to come in at the same time with the same objective of saying let’s get rid of this nonsense and say what do we must do to really fix our problems  it feels like whether it’s at the state or federal level the country is paralyzed and i’m the kind of guy who likes action likes closure and i don’t see a lot of action or closure in government right now so that’s not something i see myself doing at this point william o’shaughnessy is there anybody out there whose conduct commends itself to your favorable judgment  anybody you admire abroad in the land al kelly well i think rob astorino has done a terrific job as the westchester county executive  i know people see their property taxes going up  but their taxes aren’t going up because of the westchester tax  westchester county taxes are a small piece of it  rob i think has taken very much a business approach to this by not trying to make his job bigger but to make his job smaller  and to try to really focus on what’s important  and i think he’s done a really nice job in westchester  william o’shaughnessy what about the governor he might run against  andrew al kelly well i think governor cuomo has done a good job as well  he took on the courageous decision of doing something about the tappan zee bridge and these are not easy decisions because of the fact that it takes years and years for these things to happen and you start these projects and you’ll never see them end on your watch  and i know when i was at the white house president reagan initiated the new ’s that would serve as air force one … but he was never going to fly on a  as air force one  but those were courageous decisions to start something somebody else is going to get credit for  that takes some courage  william o’shaughnessy when you were at the white house what did you do for president reagan al kelly i was in charge of information technology for eight of the eleven agencies that comprise the office of the president  so i had the desktops which at the time were word processing machines and i was converting over to ibm pc’s  i was there during the email system profs which got a lot of  attention during the iran contra affair where john poindexter and bud mcfarlane and ultimately ollie north all had their … the history books will write that it is the first time people realized that – unlike phone calls that go away when they’re over – emails don’t disappear … what really was the first instant of an email being a real zinger and capturing something that somebody did after the fact when the person would have thought it might have been private or might have gone away  it was an incredible time for me as a young person to have a job of that stature and be able to enjoy washington which is a wonderful city … a great place to live and we enjoyed the three years we were down there william o’shaughnessy what did you think of ronald wilson reagan al kelly i can’t say enough good things about him  again a guy who had vision tried to pull people together of all kinds  we’ve talked about it but it’s true … he and tip o’neill could get in a room together – their politics were vastly different – but let’s get stuff done  it’s been so disappointing to me that president obama and john boehner can’t get in a room and put stuff aside and say for the good of the country let’s just get things done  i’d be hard pressed for anybody to be terribly impressed with the list – or lack of a list – of things that have gotten done unfortunately since president obama became president  it’s not all his fault  but it’s a short piece of paper  it’s not a chapter in a book it’s not even probably a full page in a chapter  that’s because washington has been really in a state of being paralyzed  william o’shaughnessy what do you think about president barack obama al kelly i did not vote for him … but when i watched him on election night and when i watched him on the first inauguration … i said you know what … this is going to be good for the country  he is going to be a real breath of fresh air  he’s going to bring people together  he’s going to galvanize people  i can’t tell you how disappointed i’ve been  it’s been anything but that  he’s been a bit too divisive and hasn’t really galvanized people  and unfortunately president of the united states is a humungous job and quite frankly if you look at his resume and his background you wouldn’t hire him for president of practically anything  william o’shaughnessy you would … not al kelly you wouldn’t … just on the merits of what he’s got on his resume william o’shaughnessy could he have run the super bowl like alfred kelly jr al kelly i don’t want to get into that … i’m sure many people could have done a better job than i did  i’m happy with what i did but i don’t want to get into comparing who else could have done it william o’shaughnessy i don’t want you to take this the wrong way but as i think about all the information and computer stuff in your background … you don’t look like a “computer geek” … yet your were running the damn white house al kelly well you’ve got to remember bill …  i have a  computer science degree from iona college and today my yearold runs rings around me  you wouldn’t want me … william o’shaughnessy you’re kidding … al kelly oh my gosh  it’s changed  it’s one of the most incredible things about the last  –  years the changes in technology and the speed at which they are changing  it is truly amazing william o’shaughnessy al kelly … you’re a man of so many parts … i have to ask what you think of this nsa spying on our european friends it seems everything you do these days the government is watching … al kelly well i think the government has to do its job of safeguarding us  i think it’s one of the principal jobs of the federal government … to safeguard our borders and safeguard our liberty  and i’m not smart enough bill to judge exactly what we ought to do to make sure we’re safe  that said … i do think some spying some active listening probably has to play a role in that activity of protecting our freedom and protecting our way life and protecting our borders  whether it has gone too far is not really – i don’t have enough information – to make that judgment  i’m not sure there’s really anybody in the private sector that does have enough information to make the judgment if we’ve really gone too far  i could tell you we’d all be very upset if the federal government wasn’t doing the things necessary to protect our liberty … because at the end of the day the thing that makes our country the great country it is is that it is a true democracy and we do live in true freedom where you have all kinds of states doing all kinds of things but we all do coalesce as one country behind our freedom william o’shaughnessy alfred f kelly … what does f stand for  i’ll bet i can guess al kelly francis … william o’shaughnessy you’ve been very generous to indulge my curiosity about you and my questions  i’ve admired you from afar for a long time  how old are you now al kelly  bill … a young  william o’shaughnessy but you’re not finished yet are you al kelly no i feel … i’ve got a year old  no i’m not finished  i honestly think there will be at least two more chapters to my life  probably three … i want to continue to have a very active corporate career over the next number of years again in one job or in a portfolio of jobs  i’ve had a dream that in my first stage of retirement i’d go teach at the college or graduate school level and that remains a dream i would like to fulfill william o’shaughnessy what would you teach al kelly i would probably teach a combination of management leadership classes as well as product marketing classes … not computer science classes  and the third chapter would be to travel enjoying grandchildren continuing to catch up with friends and those kinds of things  william o’shaughnessy let me beg another moment alfred francis kelly jr what makes a good manager  who better to ask al kelly bill i feel there’s a huge difference being a good manager and a good leader  i think a good manager is somebody who makes the trains run on time and fixes problems and has good followup and runs good meetings  i think a leader ideally does those things … but a leader sets a vision  a leader makes sure their ego is in check and their most important job in the world is to get great people around them  a leader is somebody who is incredibly empathetic to their people and doesn’t look at their people like an asset like a building or technology but realizes their people are human beings and treats them as such  for me the ultimate test of somebody being a good leader is if someone will follow them to the ends of the earth and work for them and tell other people you should work for this person  those are kind of the litmus tests of what i think are great leaders and many of them are good managers  some great leaders may not be as good on making the trains run on time but they’re smart enough to put people in place who do know how to make the trains run on time  william o’shaughnessy he ran the super bowl among many other things  his name is alfred f kelly jr  he’s a child of westchester a son of our county and we’re so proud of him  are you going to write a book about all the pressures and all the people and all the pleadings and importunings visited on you for tickets to that damn super bowl  and the parking passes even worse al kelly i don’t think so  i probably could write a somewhat interesting book william o’shaughnessy did a lot of people pressure you al kelly it wasn’t too bad  i was amazed at the amount of … i wouldn’t call it pressure … but interesting was the amount of people who wanted to work on this effort  i probably got a thousand resumes or inquiries and at its height i had  fulltime people   so i don’t know whether that’s a sign of when i started … we were still – not that it’s great now – still coming out of the hangover period of the late  –  meltdown  but i also think the nfl’s got an incredible brand  the super bowl is incredible  this was a super bowl of many firsts and to that end people were very interested  i got ticket requests like crazy but we were able to manage through it  william o’shaughnessy would you like goodell’s job al kelly roger has done a phenomenal job and has many many great years ahead of him and i root for him to do well for decades to come  i’ll go do something else and let him do his job  william o’shaughnessy one final crazy question … you and peggy courted at the beechmont the local saloon  do you ever go back al kelly we haven’t been back in a while i have to confess  it’s probably been four or five years since we’ve been there  bill when we first got married we lived in mount vernon and then we lived in two different homes in new rochelle and when we lived in new rochelle we would go there  but now we’ve been up in the harrisonrye section of the county for almost seven years now  so we don’t necessarily come down  we come down a lot for iona college basketball games but i haven’t been to the beechmont or a lot of the new rochelle hangouts i spent a lot of days and nights at in my iona college years william o’shaughnessy you honor us with your presence  i promised your office … i’m running late and they’re waiting for you in manhattan al kelly bill thank you  it’s been a pleasure to be with you william o’shaughnessy alfred f kelly jr is his name … it will be interesting to see what’s next for this guy       william o’shaughnessy a former president of the new york state broadcasters association was chairman of public affairs for the national association of broadcasters in washington  he has been a point man and advocate for the
