research  development compensation as of fiscal year  sentreheart inc key developments sentreheart inc amaze trial receives fda approval for stage ii expansion based on  subject interim safety and performance analysis jun   sentreheart inc announced fda approval to expand to stage ii of the amaze trial the approval comes as a result of prespecified analysis of adjudicated safety and performance results from initial  enrolled subjects by independent data monitoring committee dmc and fda the amaze trial aims to assess improved outcomes in the treatment of atrial fibrillation afib when the lariat is used to close the left atrial appendage laa in adjunct to pulmonary vein isolation pvi catheter ablation in those patients that suffer from drugrefractory persistent and longstanding persistent afib the trial is designed in two sequential stages with data from both stages used in primary endpoint analyses stage i intended to monitor the adjudicated safety and performance results of the lariat in the first  consecutively enrolled subjects against prespecified criteria as assessed by an independent data monitoring committee with stage ii approval sentreheart will expand the amaze trial to  centers across the united states and limited international locations sentreheart inc completes stage i enrollment milestone in amaze trial jan   sentreheart inc announced that it has completed the stage i enrollment milestone in the amaze trial the trial aims to assess improved outcomes when the lariat suture delivery system is used to close the left atrial appendage in adjunct to pulmonary vein isolation catheter ablation in those patients that suffer from drugrefractory persistent and longstanding persistent afib stage i of the amaze trial is designed to assess safety and performance of the lariat procedure in the first  consecutively enrolled subjects assessed by independent adjudication and data monitoring committees the first subject was enrolled into the amaze trial in october  and the trial is currently recruiting subjects in  us centers it is anticipated that by mid  the amaze trial will expand to  centers across the us and in limited international locations afib is an irregular rapid heartbeat or quivering of the upper chambers of the heart called the atria due to a malfunction in the heart’s electrical system it is the most common sustained arrhythmia and a major global public health problem due to its associated morbidity including stroke and heart failure diminished quality of life and increased mortality approximately  million individuals worldwide suffer from afib with close to  million new cases occurring each year studies have demonstrated the lariat not only closes the laa mechanically but may also isolate electrical activity within the laa having a nonimplant option that may both electrically and mechanically isolate the laa is a potentially important addition to the treatment armamentarium for clinicians treating patients with persistent or longstanding persistent afib the lariat has the potential to eliminate the laa as a source of afib and nidus for thrombus unlike other implant solutions for afib the amaze trial seeks to potentially treat the underlying disorder of af by mechanically and electrically isolating the base of the laa using the percutaneous nonimplant lariat suture delivery device
