december   is a biopharmaceutical company the company is engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutics that treat diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis folding trafficking and clearance the company has developed the disease relevant translation drt technology platform a drug screening approach for identifying highly translatable therapeutics based on predictive and functionally pertinent phenotypic assays and disease relevant models using this platform the company has identified a new class of small molecules amplifiers that modulate proteins in the proteostasis network the companys initial therapeutic focus is cystic fibrosis cf which is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr protein and insufficient cftr protein function the company is developing and intend to commercialize its lead amplifier of cftr protein pti to improve cftr protein functionptithe companys lead product candidate pti is an orally bioavailable cftr modulator belonging to the amplifier class cftr modulators are compounds that affect the folding trafficking and clearance of cftr protein and can be classified according to the ways in which they affect cftr protein amplifiers which include pti are cftr modulators that selectively increase the amount of an immature form of cftr protein thereby providing additional substrate for other cftr modulators such as correctors and potentiators to act upon correctors such as lumacaftor or vx are known to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded cftr protein to achieve some level of activity without repairing the actual protein potentiators such as ivacaftor are believed to increase the opening time of the cftr protein channel resulting in higher ion flow across the cell membrane pti is in clinical developmentptincthe companys ptinc is a combination of pti together with a corrector and a potentiator which can achieve mechanistic synergy restoring in vitro cftr protein activity to approximately  of normal in patientderived human bronchial epithelial hbe cells homozygous for fdel additionally the combination of the corrector and potentiator in ptinc has demonstrated superior in vitro efficacy compared to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor the company focuses to complete a preclinical safety and efficacy profile of ptincptithe companys pti is a small molecule amplifier that has been shown to enhance the function of normal and mutated cftr in human cf patientderived primary lung epithelial cell cultures in vitro the companys pti could be formulated for inhalation by means of commonly used inhalers and nebulizers pti is in advanced stages of preclinical development and has been tested in safety and toxicology studies in rodent and nonrodent species as an orally formulated productpartnered programsthe usp program is focused to enhance clearance of misfolded and damaged proteins which is essential for maintaining normal protein homeostasis or proteostasis in cells the companys unfolded protein response upr program is focused on developing therapies that modulate the cellular processes activated when proteins do not fold properly and is directed toward developing treatments for diseases caused by defects in protein folding

announces preliminary data from phase i cystic fibrosis study jun   proteostasis therapeutics inc has announced preliminary data from the multiple ascending dose mad cohort of its phase i trial designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of pti in cf or cystic fibrosis subjects safety and pk data from the first eight subjects who have completed dosing and followup were evaluated by the src primary endpoints of the study were safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics pk patients were randomized to receive  mg pti or placebo for seven days in addition to their background orkambi therapy pti was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no adverse events to discontinuation observed and adverse events observed in subjects were mild two or moderate one and were deemed unrelated to study therapy preliminary data confirmed the pti pk profile to be comparable to that achieved in healthy volunteers and showed a lack of impact on orkambi exposure levels including both ivacaftor and lumacaftor suggesting no clinically significant drugdrug interaction notably peak concentration achieved approached ec for pti safety endpoints included forced expiratory volume in one second fev and exploratory endpoints included changes in sweat chloride sc and cftr mrna preliminary analysis of changes in respiratory function for those patients with complete lung function data over the study period indicates a positive trend from baseline to the end of the day dosing period as measured by fev and return to baseline levels at the end of the day follow up period the overall changes in lung function during the treatment interval favored the group that received pti versus placebo although such changes were not statistically significant as the study was not designed to confirm difference from placebo preliminary sweat chloride data suggest that pti modulates cftr activity the alteration in sc is consistent with published data on lumacaftor and tezacaftor where changes in sc levels did not correlate with fev improvement with a limited dataset a correlation has not been observed between cftr mrna and fev further analysis of the study including follow up on all patients enrolled in this cohort is expected to be reported in july for the cohort of cf patients not currently on cftr modulator therapy subjects received pti or placebo as their sole cftr modulator therapy for seven days while this cohort remains blinded of the five patients enrolled to date four were evaluated by the src for safety and tolerability and treatment was found to be generally well tolerated with no treatment related adverse events observed five adverse events observed so far were all mild further analysis from the ptionly cohort including follow up on all patients enrolled is also expected to be reported in july a separate study with a third patient population is initiating enrollment of cf patients who will receive pti or placebo in addition to kalydeco as background therapy for  days proteostasis expects to announce preliminary results from this study during the third quarter pti data support progression into phase ii day dosing cohort progressing to triple combination ptincafter a washout period patients on orkambi background therapy who were enrolled in the day dosing mad cohort are eligible to enroll in the phase ii portion of the pti study a day dosing cohort upon review of the safety data from the mad cohort in cf subjects on background orkambi therapy the src has approved initiation of this next stage of clinical development with pti the company has initiated screening of patients for the day study and plans to report safety and efficacy data from this cohort in fourth quarter of proteostasis is currently conducting a day mad phase i study of pti corrector in healthy volunteers in the us to be followed by dosing in cf patients if positive results are achieved in the companys pti and pti programs the company intends to initiate a triple combination proof of concept poc study which will combine pti pti and pti also known as ptinc in an fdel homozygous population who are not taking orkambi at the end of  the study will explore different doses of pti with fixed dose combination of pti and pti proteostasis therapeutics inc announces clinical and regulatory progress across pipeline programs jun   proteostasis therapeutics inc announced updates across the company’s later stage development programs in cf including pti a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator amplifier pti a new generation cftr corrector and pti a cftr potentiator the updates were announced during the th european cystic fibrosis society conference in seville spain where the company is presenting detailed results from the single ascending dose cohort of its phase  trial of pti in healthy volunteer and cf subjects as well as its biobank and discovery of readthrough molecules initiatives pti amplifier clinical data in three separate populations of cf patients on track for midyear by the end of june the company expects to report preliminary data including lung function from multiple ascending dose cohorts of two different cf patient populations at least eight cf subjects receiving pti or placebo in addition to orkambi® as their background for seven days and up to eight cf subjects receiving pti as their sole cftr modulator therapy or placebo for seven days lung function as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second or fev  is being assessed as well as changes in sweat chloride underscoring rising momentum in the program expanded data from four additional subjects in each arm is anticipated next month after a washout period patients on orkambi® background therapy who were enrolled in the day dosing mad cohort are eligible to enroll in a day clinical study for pti which is expected to start at the end of june this longer duration study of cf subjects already on standard orkambi® background therapy is expected to generate safety and efficacy data from up to  subjects with the goal of identifying a dose level for the triple combination proof of concept poc combining pti pti and pti known as ptinc the company is studying pti in multiple cf populations because in vitro studies indicate it is agnostic to cf genotype results from a separate study in a third patient population where cf patients will receive pti or placebo in addition to kalydeco as background therapy for  days is expected in the third quarter pti new generation corrector phase  healthy volunteer sad study complete mad study underway the company announced the completion of the healthy volunteer sad portion of its phase  study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of pti a day mad portion in healthy volunteers is underway in the us with results from both study portions to be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting safety pharmacokinetics and efficacy data from cf subjects on background orkambi therapy is expected in the second half of  the goal of this study is to identify a dose level for the triple combination poc combining pti pti and pti pti potentiator advancing to ind drf study intended to be poc for triple combination by year end  as previously announced proteostasis expects to submit an investigational new drug application for pti its cftr potentiator to the food and drug administration fda by the end of this month the company plans to initiate a phase  study in healthy volunteers in july if the company receives positive results from its pti and pti programs the company intends to initiate a dose range finding drf study at the end of  in an fdel homozygous population who are not taking orkambi® the study design is expected to
