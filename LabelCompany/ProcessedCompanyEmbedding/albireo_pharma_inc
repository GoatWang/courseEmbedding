albireo homepage menu this site uses cookies to give you the best possible experience learn more albireo » about biliary atresia menu about biliary atresia biliary atresia is a blockage or absence of bile ducts that irreversibly prevents bile flow from the liver to the small intestine causing accumulation of bile that damages the liver the damage leads to scarring loss of liver tissue and cirrhosis which makes it difficult for the liver to remove toxins from the blood and deteriorates the liver biliary atresia is life threatening and a common reason for liver transplantation in children the estimated worldwide incidence of biliary atresia is  per  births there are no medicines currently approved to treat biliary atresia the typical treatment is a surgery known as the kasai procedure or hepatoportoenterostomy in which the obstructed bile ducts are removed and a section of the small intestine is connected to the liver directly the chance of a successful kasai procedure is best if done before two months of age however even with early intervention scarring of the liver can continue resulting in cirrhosis and eventually transplantation only about  percent of those initially undergoing the kasai will survive into their twenties without need for liver transplantation the exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown but it is thought to result from an event in the womb or around the time of birth possible triggers may include viral or bacterial infection an immune system malfunction a genetic mutation a problem during liver or bile duct development or exposure to toxic substances albireo homepage menu this site uses cookies to give you the best possible experience learn more albireo » cookie policy menu cookie policy this site uses cookies – small text

is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive lifethreatening liver disease which may start early after birth or at a young age and rapidly progress to endstage liver disease  three alternative gene defects have been identified that correlate to three separate pfic subtypes known as types   and   the precise prevalence of pfic is unknown but pfic has been estimated to affect between one in every  to  children born worldwide pfic is commonly associated with elevated serum bile acids  prominent symptoms of pfic include pruritus which is associated with severe sleep disturbance and diminished overall quality of life and poor growth firstline treatment in pfic is typically offlabel ursodeoxycholic acid udca  notwithstanding treatment with udca many pfic patients will require partial external biliary diversion pebd surgery and ultimately liver transplantation  although success rates vary published thirdparty studies have shown that pebd surgery can slow and in some cases stop the progression of liver disease and lead to reduced pruritus and improved sleep about albireo  albireo pharma is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused through its operating
