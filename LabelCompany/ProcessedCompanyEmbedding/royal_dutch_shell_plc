evolutionedit     operationsedit business groupingsedit upstream activities currently generate around twothirds of shells revenues shell is currently organised into four major business groupings upstream – manages the upstream business it searches for and recovers crude oil and natural gas and operates the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver oil and gas to the market its activities are organised primarily within geographic units although there are some activities that are managed across the business or provided through support units integrated gas and new energies – manages liquefying natural gas converting gas to liquids and lowcarbon opportunities downstream – manages shells manufacturing distribution and marketing activities for oil products and chemicals manufacturing and supply includes refinery supply and shipping of crude oil projects and technology – manages the delivery of shells major projects provides technical services and technology capability covering both upstream and downstream activities it is also responsible for providing functional leadership across shell in the areas of health safety and environment and contracting and procurement oil and gas activitiesedit former shell oil depot in kowloon hong kong around the mids shells primary business is the management of a vertically integrated oil company the development of technical and commercial expertise in all stages of this vertical integration from the initial search for oil exploration through its harvesting production transportation refining and finally trading and marketing established the core competencies on which the company was founded similar competencies were required for natural gas which has become one of the most important businesses in which shell is involved and which contributes a significant proportion of the companys profits while the vertically integrated business model provided significant economies of scale and barriers to entry each business now seeks to be a selfsupporting unit without subsidies from other parts of the company traditionally shell was a heavily decentralised business worldwide especially in the downstream with companies in over  countries each of which operated with a high degree of independence the upstream tended to be far more centralised with much of the technical and financial direction coming from the central offices in the hague the upstream oil sector is also commonly known as the exploration and production sector downstream operations which now also includes the chemicals business generates a third of shells profits worldwide and is known for its global network of more than  petrol stations and its various oil refineries the downstream business which in some countries also included oil refining generally included a retail petrol station network lubricants manufacture and marketing industrial fuel and lubricants sales and a host of other productmarket sectors such as lpg and bitumen the practice in shell was that these businesses were essentially local and that they were best managed by local operating companies – often with middle and senior management reinforced by expatriates

purchase of a second offshore lease in  shell only commenced drilling work in  due to the refurbishment of rigs permit delays from the relevant authorities and lawsuits the plans to drill in the arctic led to protests from environmental groups particularly greenpeace furthermore analysts in the energy field as well as related industries also expressed skepticism due to perceptions that drilling in the region is too dangerous because of harsh conditions and remote locations further problems hampered the arctic project after the commencement of drilling in  as shell dealt with a

going to have the legal environment to go forward dont spend the money unless youre sure youre going to have the permit no i cant tell you that im going to have that permit until june but we need to plan like were going to have that permit in june and so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the onoff switches wherever we could and take control of our own destiny based

im going to have that permit until june but we need to plan like were going to have that permit in june and so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the onoff switches

integrated oil company the development of technical and commercial expertise in all stages of this vertical integration from the initial search for oil exploration through its harvesting production transportation refining and finally trading and marketing established the core competencies on which the company was founded similar competencies were required for natural gas which has become one of the most important businesses in which shell is involved and which contributes a significant proportion of the companys profits while the vertically integrated business model provided significant economies of scale and barriers to entry each business now seeks to be a selfsupporting unit without subsidies from other parts of the company traditionally shell was a heavily decentralised business worldwide especially in the downstream with companies in over  countries each of which operated with a high degree of independence the upstream tended to be far more centralised with much of the technical and financial direction coming from the central offices in the hague the upstream oil sector is also commonly known as the exploration and production sector downstream operations which now also includes the chemicals business generates a third of shells profits worldwide and is known for its global network of more than  petrol stations and its various oil refineries the downstream business which in some countries also included oil refining generally included a retail petrol station network lubricants manufacture and marketing industrial fuel and lubricants sales and a host of other productmarket sectors such as lpg and bitumen the practice in shell was that these businesses were essentially local and that they were best managed by local operating companies – often with

previously worked in the north sea however after the purchase of a second offshore lease in  shell only commenced drilling work in  due to the refurbishment of rigs permit delays from the relevant authorities and lawsuits the plans to drill in the arctic led to protests from environmental groups particularly greenpeace furthermore analysts in the energy field as well as related industries also

other words dont spend the money unless youre sure youre going to have the legal environment to go forward dont spend the money unless youre sure youre going to have the permit no i cant tell you that im going to have that permit until june but we need to plan like were going to have that permit in june and so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the onoff switches

illtreatment of lawyers and family membersshell ep irish exit on shell blog shell blog comments all latest on fri  amhr watcher i feel sorry for that young lady who is making claims against shell oil here across the us discrimination is common place in shell locations its part of normal life it is just always swept under the carpet unless if there is physical contact involved or a guy they want to fire already i have lots of examples of this happening i one day hope i can say more but at the moment i have kids to feed and i dont want shell to track me down yes shame on me i knowfegalo nsuke the nigerian state pretends not to know the truth about the pains of the ogoni people and the discrimination against the minorities of the niger delta whose resources have funded our federal budgets and supports our predominantly poor states which cannot survive without federal subventions shell and nigeria has consciously and completely destroyed the niger delta and particularly ogoniland today one nigerian petroleum development company npdc is shamelessly making moves to reenter ogoniland for oil it is ridiculous to imagine that despite repeated warnings and a rejection of this pestlike company the npdc continuous its corrupt traits for which it is widely known and want to get the ogoni oil through the backdoor the npdc is nigerias oil drilling company it epitomizes the true attitude of the nigerian state towards the ogoni people shamelessly and callously looking at the face of a dying population and telling them we will kill you and take your oil and as usual nigeria will certainly be willing to provide its security forces to shoot and kill any resistance just as they have always done it is quite disturbing to see our country not bother about its mighty army showing its strength against a small and peaceful struggle like that of the ogoni while the government offers amnesty to niger delta civilians who managed to gain access to arms and will perpetually look for negotiators with the boko haram insurgents i see it as a national shame to send our well trained army against a peaceful and civil protest all nigeria care about is the ogoni oil they want it at all cost and will kill for it like we saw in  with the hanging of ken sarowiwa and  others for over  years they have shown this brutal attitude towards the oil producing niger delta and that attitude has not changed on sunday july   i was in biara in gokana local government area where reports of pipe laying activities had surfaced one kagbara full name withheld came with the complaint we confirmed the massive land grading in parts of biara in gokana local government area in nigeria i see a government that should promote human dignity care and protect becoming so oppressive acting in utter disregard to the sensitivities of its own people but nigeria shell or the npdc can be sure that ogoni will not surrender to this harassment and intimidation we will all match down to the oil fields to protest this unending abuse and disregard for our rejection of all forms of oil production in ogoniland for now unfortunately our leaders do not seem to bother about our dignity and the need to protect the integrity of our armed forces they continue to abuse and ridicule our soldiers as the struggle for a better society continues the current moves regarding the unpermitted invasion of parts of ogoniland should be seen as an invitation for the people to fight for what belongs to them as a people we cannot be silent in the face of this affront shell and her ally the npdc are at it again and let it be known that another round of bloodshed is about to take place in ogoniland because as a people we are bound to say no to any form of oil production activity in ogoniland the writer fegalo nsuke is the publicity secretary of the movement for the survival of the ogoni people mosop he wrote from port harcourt nigeriaextankerdriver under the hood of shell’s  million loyalty program several years ago shell made the mistake of disbanding their trucking fleet and leasing the retail locations to wholesalers who now control the rents and the price of the fuel the dealers pay the wholesalers purchase the fuel from shell and resell it to the dealers adding on a few cents profit plus a charge to have a carrier deliver it to the station this leaves the shell dealers unable to compete with the other area stations in my local area the shell station is charging  cents more per gallon for regular self service cash and up to  cents more for credit while  other major brand stations are the same price  cents less for cash or credit  or  cents a gallon is not a big deal but  cents has sent many long time loyal customers defecting to the competitionshell ep irish exit so shell is due to get €m upfront for selling its corrib stake holding any further payment is dependent on exceeding production targets and also partly on gas prices not the outcome shell would have wished but the best obtainable after it has long worn out its welcome green goblin i am surprised that shell is still able to operate the way it does despite opl  illegal cover up of oil spills spectacular uturn on the arctic animal testing being the cause of earthquakes in groningen spying by shell security and government teams screwing over its pensioners and many many more disgraceful actions bad management and refusal to listen to staff concerns is whats destroying the company the company has lost its way and its morals and what it used to stand formoney laundering i commend you on your article shell money laundering for saudi arabia as the ngo global witness pointed out earlier this year in relation to the opl  corruption scandal nobody should be above the law even the mighty royal dutch shell enterprise global witness and the corner house have campaigned and exposed the corruption around the opl  deal for several years in  shell and eni paid  billion to malabu oil and gas a front company secretly owned by a former nigerian oil minister prosecutors have alleged that over usm went to “fronts for former president goodluck jonathan of nigeria” this crooked deal deprived nigeria’s people of a sum worth  of its  healthcare budget shell and eni have always denied that they knew the money would go to malabu but documents seen by global witness show that the companies constructed the deal knowing that the money would flow ultimately to etete’s companyjohn donovan with regards to the matter raised by jazmin anderson it may indeed be a scam  see fraud and scam alert on the shellcom website it should be easy to verify whether any documents purported to be shell documents are authentic or fake if fake then the scam should immediately be reported to the appropriate police authorityfao jazmin sounds like a classic  scam to me jazmin anderson to mr john donovan thank you mr donovan for the kind attention i will provide and email you the details of my husbands ordeal i also tried to reach shell global hotline but i am not sure if they even entertain such circumstance especially coming from an ordinary person like myself i am grateful for this opportunity to obtain all the help referral and assistance i could get sincerely i remainjohn donovan message to jazmin anderson we published your appeal for information concerning patrick blinks you have followed this up with various allegations in a further posting submitted for publication before we proceed further please provide a detailed account of the background to this story ideally in chronological order and with supporting evidence we would then put the allegations directly to shell ceo mr ben van burden so that shell has the opportunity to investigate and respond if it wishes to do so any further publication by us will depend on the information you supply and any response by shell please send to email protected jazmin anderson hello all i have read some of the blogs here from former employees of shell and i would like to ask if you know someone by the name of “patrick blinks” he is a purchasing officer  contractor with shell and currently has a project in the gulf of mexico in a rig called “taiwan ocean” my husband is the project manager and he and his workers have been there for five months now the project is done although there were some issues with the pipes being damaged my husband’s team were able to extract barrels of crude oil right now the problem is “patrick blinks” would like to get his workers paid before letting my husband and his team to leave this is not possible at all since they don’t have any access to any bank my husband asked mr blinks to let him go to his bank so he could get some money out and mr blinks don’t want to do that and does not even answer phone calls or emails i have been searching for “patrick blinks” so i could speak to him either in person or by phone and to let my husband leave the gulf for health reasons if any one of you by any chance who knows this person or know someone who may be associated with him please inform me right away i have limited communication with my husband and i am helping them to get out of the gulf moreso since there was contract signed shell and its legal department cannot assist thank you all for your time and effort and with sincere gratitude for your help…trekkie role of a hapless ann

unless youre sure youre going to have the permit no i cant tell you that im going to have that permit until june but we need to plan like were going to have that permit in june and so probably the
