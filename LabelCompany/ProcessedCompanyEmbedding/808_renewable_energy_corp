renewable assets include  onshore wind farms located everywhere from the hawaiian island of maui to the green hills of northeast pennsylvania the company’s us wind farms have a gross generating capacity of  megawatts that’s enough electricity to power all the homes in a city the size of philadelphia bp directly operates  wind farms — in colorado idaho indiana kansas pennsylvania south dakota and texas — while holding an interest in a separate wind facility in hawaii the company estimates that in  a net wind portfolio the size of bp’s helped avoid nearly  million tons of carbon dioxide emissions to put that number in perspective it is equivalent to the annual electricityrelated emissions of around  typical homes the emissions produced by burning roughly  billion pounds of coal or the emissions produced by consuming more than  million gallons of gasoline  every bpoperated wind farm receives roundtheclock support from onsite personnel andor from bp’s remote operations center roc in downtown houston during normal business hours operators at individual wind farms manage their sites during offhours weekends and holidays operators at the roc take control using advanced technology roc teams centrally monitor all bp sites —  hours a day seven days a week — while working with colleagues in the field to enhance performance reliability and safety roc monitoring systems capture turbine availability power generation capacity wind speed weather and other critical factors an embedded alarm system immediately notifies operators of potential problems such as approaching storms or flash flood warnings whether in the the high plains of kansas or anywhere else the company has wind operations bp works hard to prevent its business from affecting local wildlife and habitats for example it voluntarily adjusts the movement of wind turbines to reduce their impact on bat populations during peak migration season “we are always focused on safety and sustainability in everything we do at our wind farms” says bp wind energy ceo laura folse “our staffers at the roc provide an extra set of eyes and help our people in the field work safely and responsibly” the benefits of wind power wind power is safe clean and increasingly affordable – with the potential for production on a much larger scale as a lowcarbon energy source the use of wind reduces the amount of carbon produced to meet the world’s energy needs we estimate that bp wind energy’s wind energy generation in  alone offset nearly  million tons of co in  which is equivalent to the annual emissions from approximately  typical homes according to the bp  sustainability report as wind turbine technology has continued to evolve and improve wind farms using new generation technology can produce more energy at an everdecreasing cost – a cost that is becoming increasingly competitive in the overall energy marketplace at bp wind energy we are committed to playing a central role in mapping the future of this

market energy users the largest segment of total us energy consumption our existing base of distressed chp assets and an extensive network of relationships with both existing and available distressed chp opportunities and strategic and regulatory partners benefits of cogeneration a cleaner and renewable energy technology combined heat and power is the production of electricity by combustion of a fuel like natural gas biomass biogas or coal and the capture of generated thermal energy nearly  of cogen units use natural gas cogeneration is the use of a heat engine or a power plant to simultaneously generate both electricity and heat in the separate production of electricity some energy must be rejected as waste heat but in cogeneration this thermal energy is put to good use by capturing the excess heat cogeneration uses heat that would otherwise be wasted in a conventional power plant and converts it to useful electricity heat or air conditioning a typical cogeneration system consists of an engine steam turbine or a combustion turbine that drives an electrical generator a waste heat exchanger recovers waste heat from the engine andor exhaust gas to produce hot water or steam as a thermodynamically efficient use of fuel cogeneration produces a given amount of electric power and process heat with  to  less fuel than it takes to produce electricity and process heat separately as a result less fuel is consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy thereby reducing fuel consumption and dramatically reducing pollution produced in the form of greenhouse gases

the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to this offering we believe that the primary competition for our energy services is from existing electric utilities in our current market of california we compete with southern california edison san diego gas  electric and pacific gas  electric those companies are much larger than we are in terms of revenues assets and resources we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of cost we aim to compete with large utility companies by selling electricity to the individual commercial building customers at rates lower than those offered by such utilities however we typically only supply a portion of the electricity needs of the building the remaining portion is supplied by the electric utility our contracts generally provide that the price of energy is a fixed percentage less than the price that otherwise would be charged by our customer’s utility company we do not manufacture chp units or other related components for example we use internal combustion engines manufactured by other companies to generate the energy that we sell to customers in most cases we view the manufacturers as suppliers of equipment and not as competitors however such manufacturers may sell their equipment directly to end users who are sophisticated enough to install and operate the equipment the primary manufacturers of such internal combustion engines are hess microgen caterpillar inc cummins power generation inc and waukesha engine a subsidiary of general electric company we have installed hess microgen or waukesha engine engines at all of our locations manufacturers such as general electric company caterpillar inc and waukesha engine have the infrastructure to manufacture chp units but are not designed to provide the services we do on a sitebysite basis large energy companies like general electric company and british petroleum are starting to add alternative energy technologies to their portfolios these companies are focusing on large scale wind solar and fuel cell projects while we are able to focus on smaller onsite power generation projects some companies producing cogeneration systems that are potential competitors to us include capstone turbine corporation flex energy and general electric company additionally we compete against providers of alternative energy the alternative energy market is emerging rapidly many companies are developing alternative and renewable energy sources including solar power wind power fuel cells and microturbines some of the companies in this sector include general electric company bp plc royal dutch shell and sunedison a division of memc electronic materials inc plug power inc and fuelcell energy inc in the fuel cell space and capstone turbine corporation ingersoll rand plc and elliott turbomachinery a division of the elliott group inc in the microturbine space the effect of these developing technologies on our business is difficult to predict but has not had a measurable effect on our target market to date some of our competitors are large companies that tackle energy efficiency for the entire building including water usage light bulb efficiency and other interior modifications we focus on one area which allows us to provide faster results and cost savings that large scale energy reduction projects cannot produce as they must gather massive amounts of data and budgeting approvals a few local companies are attempting to offer technologies similar to ours however we operate only chp plants and specialize in this technology and niche market since the inception of our company we have retained technicians who have experience in chp equipment and technology and we believe we have the proven experience to cover sites all over california there are a number of energy service companies that offer related services these companies include siemens ag honeywell international inc and johnson controls inc in general these companies do not target individual buildings – our target market because we focus on smaller projects for energy supply we believe that such companies do not attempt to compete directly with our services there are a few emerging cogeneration developers such as american dg energy that offer services similar to ours however we have not identified any that focuses primarily on our market of california company description

renewable energy corporation a nevada corporation in this report unless otherwise specified all dollar amounts are expressed in united states dollars and all references to common shares refer to the common shares in our capital stock the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report    corporate overview  renewable energy corporation the company we our was formed as a nevada corporation in may  for the purpose of acquiring developing owning and managing renewable and efficient energy projects throughout the united states before forming  renewable energy corporation we operated  energy  llc a nevada limited liability company formed in january  for the purpose of acquiring recommissioning and operating distributed generation dg energy facilities also known as combined heat and power chp plants on august    renewable acquired all of the thenoutstanding units of membership interest of  energy  llc not then already owned by  renewable thereby making  energy  llc a whollyowned subsidiary of  renewable we also acquired  energy  llc a nevada limited liability company formed in august  to acquire the chp plant located at pacific clay products inc in lake elsinore california effective as of june    renewable acquired all of the thenoutstanding units of membership interest of  energy  llc not then already owned by  renewable thereby making  energy  llc a whollyowned subsidiary of  renewable our principal executive offices are located at  harbor boulevard suite a garden grove california  our telephone number is   and our website address is wwwrenewableenergycom  renewable energy or the company distributes owns and operates clean onsite energy systems that produce electricity hot water heat and cooling our business model includes ownership of the equipment that we install at customers facilities and the sale of the energy produced by these systems to the customers on a longterm contractual basis we also provide engineering and other professional services to clients who own their own onsite energy systems but require assistance in their operation and maintenance we offer natural gas powered cogeneration systems that are highly reliable and energy efficient our cogeneration systems produce electricity from an internal combustion engine driving a generator while the heat from the engine and exhaust is recovered and typically used to produce heat and hot water for use at the site we also distribute and operate water chiller systems for building cooling applications that operate in a similar manner except that the engines power drives a large airconditioning compressor while recovering heat for hot water cogeneration systems reduce the amount of electricity that the customer must purchase from the local utility and produce valuable heat and hot water for the site to use as required by simultaneously providing electricity hot water and heat cogeneration systems also have a significant positive impact on the environment by reducing the carbon or co  produced by offsetting the traditional energy supplied by the electric grid and conventional hot water boilers our customers pay us for energy produced on site at a rate that is a certain percentage below the rate at which the utility companies provide them electrical and natural gas services we measure the actual amount of electrical and thermal energy produced and charge our customers accordingly we agree to install operate maintain and repair our energy systems at our sole cost and expense we also agree to obtain any necessary permits or regulatory approvals at our sole expense our agreements are generally for a term of up to  years with renewable provisions upon the mutual agreement of the parties for the customers that want to own their chp system we offer our turnkey option whereby we provide equipment systems engineering and installation interconnect approvals onsite labor and startup services needed to bring the complete chp system online for some customers we are also paid a fee to operate the systems and charge for those systems on a negotiated basis revenues from operation and maintenance services are recorded when provided and verified    we have experienced total net losses since inception of approximately  for the foreseeable future we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as our management executes our current business plan the cash cash equivalents and line of credit available from our ceo patrick carter available at june   will provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures including installations of new equipment for the next twelve months however as we continue to grow our business by adding more energy systems the cash requirements will increase we believe that our cash cash equivalents and line of credit available at june   and our ability to control certain costs including those related to general and administrative expenses will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through march   beyond march   we may need to raise additional capital through a debt financing or equity offering to meet our operating and capital needs there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in our fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms if at all in  we raised  minus  issuance costs from the sale of common shares through private placements  from the sale of preferred shares and  from the sale of a convertible note if we are unable to raise additional capital in  we may need to terminate andor adjust our current business plan financial considerations may cause us to modify planned deployment of new energy systems and we may decide to suspend installations until we are able to secure additional working capital we will evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and products that are complementary to our business however we are not currently engaged in such discussions the companys operations are comprised of several business segments the selling of energy in the form of electricity heat hot water and cooling to our customers under longterm sales agreements the sale of professional services to clients that own their own distributed generating and chp plants critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates management believes the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements property and equipment and depreciation and amortization property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation and amortization are computed using the straightline method at rates sufficient to write off the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred project assets consist of costs of materials direct labor outside contract services and project development costs incurred in connection with the construction of the smallscale renewable energy plants that the company owns depreciation is generally recorded on a straight line basis beginning in the month that operations commence over the assets estimated useful lives ranging from  to  years routine maintenance costs to the extent that they do not extend the life of the asset are expensed in the year they are incurred the company evaluates the recoverability of its longlived assets if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis to be generated from such assets in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets loss on longlived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal based on its review the company found no need to recognize impairment expense for the six months ended june   or for the year ended december      revenue recognition the company derives revenue from energy efficiency and renewable energy products and services which includes the design engineering and construction of energy systems that produce electricity heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy the company enters into longterm energy sales agreements with a typical term of  to  years with customers whereby these energy systems are owned by the company and are installed in customers buildings as of june   the company had  operating energy systems each month the company obtains readings from its energy meters to determine the amount of energy produced for each customer the company multiplies these readings by the appropriate published price of energy electricity from its customers local energy utility and the energy services agreement entered into with each customer to derive the value of the monthly energy sales less the applicable negotiated discount the companys revenues per customer on a monthly basis will vary based on the amount of energy produced by its energy systems and the published price of energy electricity natural gas or oil obtained from its customers local energy utility the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned and therefore only recognizes revenue on energy systems once those systems become operational the company recognizes revenue from the sale of equipment upon installation and recognizes revenue on professional services in accordance with the contract entered into with the customer the company must meet all of the following four criteria in order to recognize revenue  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured payments received in advance of satisfaction of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as advances from customers impact of new accounting pronouncements the company does not expect the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows results of operations for the six months ended june   compared with the six months ended june   revenues from the delivery and sale of electricity and related products including professional services for the six months ended june   were  compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or  the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the number of installed chp systems operating throughout the six months compared to the same period in  we generated  of energy developer revenue in  compared to none for the same period in  during the first six months of  the company operated  chp energy systems representing  kwh of total energy sold compared to chp energy systems representing  kwh of installed electricity plus thermal energy for the same period in  a decrease of  the energy production revenue per customer on a monthly basis is based on the sum of the amount of energy produced by the companys energy systems and the prevailing price of energy electricity natural gas or oil from its customers local energy utility that month less the discounts the company provides its customers the companys energy production revenues commence as new energy systems become operational and the company typically sells energy in the form of electricity heat hot water and cooling    cost of sales cost of sales including depreciation of  was  compared to  including depreciation of  for the same period in  a decrease of  or  the cost of fuel was  for the six months of  compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or  primarily due to lower run hours at our chp plants during the first six months of  our gross margins were  compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to the decrease in our chp plant revenue and the stubbornly high fuel prices during the six months ended june   our chp energy margins excluding depreciation were at  for the six months of  compared to  for the same period in  operating expenses our operating expenses consist of executive staff accounting and legal expenses office space general insurance and other administrative expenses our operating expenses for the six months ended june   were  after including  of stock based compensation paid to our directors for services provided during  and  plus  of stock based compensation paid to two previous employees for past services compared to  for the same period in  an decrease of  or  after removing the stock based compensation the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in internal payroll and insurance costs loss from operations the loss from operations for the six months ended june   was  inclusive of stock based compensation amounting to  of which  was paid to our directors for services provided during  and  and  was paid to two previous employees for past services which had been agreed to but inadvertently not done compared to a loss of  for the same period in  an increase of  or  or a decrease of  or  after removing the stock based compensation the decrease in the operating loss was due to better cost controls greater energy developer and energy service revenue and lower costs at our company owned chp plants due to fewer operation hours our noncash compensation expense was  in  liquidity and capital resources total current assets at june   were  a decrease of  compared to  at december   included in current assets were cash and cash equivalents of  which decreased by  at june   compared to  at december   the decrease in cash at june   compared to december   was the result of the costs of bringing new plants on line and the operation of existing energy projects the increase in prepaid expenses of  was due to the renewal of insurance premiums cash used in operating activities was  during the six months ended june   compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  the net loss for the six months ended june   was  after deducting non cash expenses of  and  after deducting noncash expenses of  for the six months ended june   during those same periods increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets used  compared with providing cash of  for the same period in  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased and required the use of cash of  during the six month period in  as compared to an increase totaling  in  during the six months ended june   the investing activities of the companys operations were for expenditures of  to enhance the value of project assets during the same six month period in  the company utilized  for those same investing opportunities the company borrowed  from its line of credit with the company ceo patrick carter which remained unpaid on june      our chp plants allow our customers to reduce both their energy costs and site carbon production by deploying combined heat and power technology on our customers premises at no cost therefore our company is capital intensive our company believes that its existing resources including cash and cash equivalents line of credit and future cash flow from operations are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing business for the foreseeable future including the next  months however as our company continues to grow its business by adding more chp plants the cash requirements will increase beyond june   we may need to raise additional capital through a debt financing or an equity offering to meet our companys operating and capital needs for future growth there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in our fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms if at all we anticipate recommissioning three additional facilities in the third quarter of  the capital cost to refurbish the existing equipment replace parts update the controls and commence operation for all three plants is estimated to be approximately  we do not currently have sufficient capital resources or revenue from operations to accomplish the recommissioning and will be required to raise additional capital through debt or equity offerings the company has been exploring various methods of raising additional capital including the sale of common stock and the sale of partial ownership interests in one or more of its existing facilities we will recommission these plants only as capital is raised to pay the capital costs however if we undertake to recommission one or more of the plants but the costs are more than anticipated we could experience a shortage of cash flow to sustain operations in which case the need for additional capital will occur earlier than anticipated and could force us to reduce or curtail certain operations we have from time to time relied upon loans from affiliates particularly our ceo patrick s carter and a director thomas grainger to meet our requirements for operating capital we do not expect such loans to be available to us in the future our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions interest rates the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us if these conditions continue and we cannot raise funds through a public or private debt financing or an equity offering our ability to grow our business may be negatively affected in such case our company may need to suspend any installation of new chp plants and significantly reduce its operating costs until market conditions improve seasonality our customers generally use additional energy during periods of more extreme temperatures accordingly our revenue generally tends to increase during the summer the majority of our heating systems sales are in the winter and the majority of our chilling systems sales are in the summer inflation inflation will generally cause conventional utility suppliers to increase their rates and since we bill our customers based on the electric utility rates our pricing will increase in tandem and positively affect our revenue however inflation might cause both our investment and cost of goods sold to increase thereby lowering our return on investment and depressing our gross margins off balance sheet arrangements our company has no off balance

slide  slide  slide  slide  slide  bp has the largest operated renewable energy business of any major international oil and gas company in the united states its renewable assets include  onshore wind farms located everywhere from the hawaiian island of maui to the green hills of northeast pennsylvania the company’s us wind farms have a gross generating capacity of  megawatts that’s enough electricity to power all the homes in a city the size of philadelphia bp directly operates  wind farms — in colorado idaho indiana kansas pennsylvania south dakota and texas — while holding an interest in a separate wind facility in hawaii the company estimates that in  a net wind portfolio the size of bp’s helped avoid nearly  million tons of carbon dioxide emissions to put that number in perspective it is equivalent to the annual electricityrelated emissions of around  typical homes the emissions produced by burning roughly  billion pounds of coal or the emissions produced by consuming more than  million gallons of gasoline  every bpoperated wind farm receives roundtheclock support from onsite personnel andor from bp’s remote operations center roc in downtown houston during normal business hours operators at individual wind farms manage their sites during offhours weekends and holidays operators at the roc take control using advanced technology roc teams centrally monitor all bp sites —  hours a day seven days a week — while working with colleagues in the field to enhance performance reliability and safety roc monitoring systems capture turbine availability power generation capacity wind speed weather and other critical factors an embedded alarm system immediately notifies operators of potential problems such as approaching storms or flash flood warnings whether in the the high plains of kansas or anywhere else the company has wind operations bp works hard to prevent its business from affecting local wildlife and habitats for example it voluntarily adjusts the movement of wind turbines to reduce their impact on bat populations during peak migration season “we are always focused on safety and sustainability in everything we do at our wind farms” says bp wind energy ceo laura folse “our staffers at the roc provide an extra set of eyes and help our people in the field work safely and responsibly” the benefits of wind power wind power is safe clean and increasingly affordable – with the potential for production on a much larger scale as a lowcarbon energy source the use of wind reduces the amount of carbon produced to meet the world’s energy needs we estimate that bp wind energy’s wind energy generation in  alone offset nearly  million tons of co in  which is equivalent to the annual emissions from approximately  typical homes according to the bp  sustainability report as wind turbine technology has continued to evolve and improve wind farms using new generation technology can produce more energy at an everdecreasing cost – a cost that is becoming increasingly competitive in the overall energy marketplace at bp wind energy we are committed to playing a central role in mapping the future of this important and exciting
