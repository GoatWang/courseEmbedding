years largely because of its thriving manufacturing sector unlike brazil and argentina whose manufacturing sectors are slumping mexico has continued to see solid growth because of its integration with and dependence on the us market although low global oil prices will put pressure on mexicos economy the performance of the manufacturing sector — especially in highend manufacturing — will be a key driver of mexicos economic growth this year and beyond in the late s and early s mexico underwent a profound economic and political reorganization the economy liberalized culminating in the north american free trade agreement major stateowned companies privatized transforming mexico from a closed economic and political system into an exportoriented industrial economy as a result trade increased between mexico and the united states and a manufacturing belt sprung up at the countries shared border from  to  mexican trade became even more closely tied to the united states in  the united states accounted for  percent of all mexican trade by  it accounted for nearly  percentbut at the turn of the century chinas special economic zones became costcompetitive alternatives to mexican factories mexico responded by making more valuable products such as automotive aeronautical and electronic products thus even though clothing exports dropped  percent from  billion to  billion between  and  automotive exports increased by  percent  billion to  billion and electronic exports increased by  percent  billion to  billion over the same period asian alternatives to highend products notwithstanding these mexican products remained costcompetitive because of naftamexicos primary intermodal networks and populationmoreover rising wages in china have once again shifted the equation in global manufacturing average manufacturing labor costs in mexico are now almost  percent lower than in china whereas in  mexicos labor costs were  percent more expensive than chinas there is also an important regional distinction that should be taken into account a significant portion of us exportoriented middle and highend manufacturing takes place in northern mexico especially around monterrey which is a major steel producing area where gdp per capita exceeds  the electronics industry is also important and contributes greatly to the economy of northern states like chihuahua baja california and tamaulipas on the other end of the spectrum lowend manufacturing of goods like clothing and textiles is continuing to expand in southern mexico in cities like campeche and veracruz making this particular region a beneficiary of chinas growing labor costssince the implementation of nafta in  mexicos real gdp climbed by about  billion to nearly  trillion this growth which placed mexico second in latin america and th in the world in terms of gdp rose primarily because of the advantages that come with mexicos proximity to the united states mexico has planned its economic strategy around these advantages which include short transport distances to the worlds largest consumer market and low wages compared with those of the united states — low wages that have spurred investment in manufacturing with the united states as a leading investor for decades the manufacturing valueadded sector now makes up  percent of mexicos gdpthe manufacturing sectors current statusthis orientation toward the us market and the diversification of mexicos manufacturing production has benefited the country significantly in recent years while brazil and argentina which along with mexico make up more than  percent of latin americas manufacturing output have seen a slump in their manufacturing sectors due to both countries slowing economies and growing restrictions within their mercosur trade bloc mexico has performed much better in large part this is structural mexico has been much more open in its economy and supportive of free trade than brazil or argentina which have followed a protectionist importsubstitution model the south american countries overall trade with the united states is also much lower than mexicos as a result mexicos manufacturing output increased by  percent in the first nine months of  while brazil and argentinas contracted by  and  percent respectivelyseveral subsectors are driving this manufacturing growth most notably in highend manufacturing such as the automotive plastics and aerospace industries mexicos auto sector has been particularly strong experiencing doubledigit export growth every year since  the plastics industry which is valued at more than  billion per year has averaged  percent growth in exports over the past five years meanwhile mexicos small but burgeoning aerospace industry based in the central state of queretaro has grown even faster in recent yearson the lower end of manufacturing there has also been steady growth though not as rapid as in much of mexicos highend manufacturing exports of textiles have averaged  percent growth over the last two years while clothing exports have averaged  percent growth this suggests that the highend sectors concentrated in northern mexico are more attractive within the countrys manufacturing sector and are larger both in terms of growth and absolute value than the lowend sector in southern mexicooutlook and broader implicationsone of the factors impacting mexicos economic growth this year will be the accelerating us economic recovery although growth for the first quarter of the year is likely to be small as mentioned previously a substantial portion of mexicos manufactured goods are exported to the united states and us demand for these products will increase as long as the us economy continues to build momentum mexicos manufacturing output is projected to increase between  and  percent for  and  and the boston consulting group expects that the manufacturing sector could add between  billion and  billion to mexicos economy through all of the subsectors that have performed well in recent years are also projected to continue strong growth in the coming years the growth rate for plastics is expected to accelerate to  percent in  while the automotive and aerospace sectors are projected to sustain strong growth for the next several years machinery and appliance manufacturing could also see strong growth and exports of textiles and carpets are likely to continue to see moderate growthhowever some less positive factors will also affect mexicos economic performance although mexicos security situation has not significantly harmed the countrys manufacturing growth water availability in the country could become a longterm constraint in manufacturing development falling oil prices and a difficult global economic environment have also put more immediate pressures on mexicos economy crude petroleum is mexicos largest export because of lower global oil prices mexicos central bank recently cut its growth outlook for this year from  percent to  percent meanwhile the peso fell by  percent during the course of  and has fallen another  percent in low global oil prices also have important regional ramifications from a manufacturing perspective low oil prices can be a boon especially for manufacturers of goods such as plastics and machinery on the other hand low oil prices add to employment problems and push wages down in mexicos primary oilproducing zones which are lowend wage zones in the countrys south for mexicos state finances this is a broader problem and there is no shortterm fix the government thus will have to rely on tax reform to close the gap somewhat until mexicos energy reforms begin benefiting the energy sector but overall the strong performance and growth prospects of mexicos manufacturing sector particularly highend manufacturing will continue to boost the countrys economy for years to comeyoure readingmexicos manufacturing sector continues to growconnected content geo    topics
