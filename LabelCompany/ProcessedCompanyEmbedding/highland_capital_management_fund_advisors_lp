limitation performance results would have been lower nonpayment risk senior loans like other corporate debt obligations are subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled interest andor principal nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to the fund a reduction in the value of the senior loan experiencing nonpayment and a potential decrease in the nav of the fund credit risk the fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in senior loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated senior loans deemed by highland to be of comparable quality securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “high yield securities” or “junk securities” they are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company’s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments investments in high yield senior loans and other securities may result in greater nav fluctuation than if the fund did not make such investments senior loans risk the risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities in that they are considered speculative in addition as with any debt instrument senior loans are also generally subject to the risk of price declines and to increases in prevailing interest rates senior loans are also subject to the risk that as interest rates rise the cost of borrowing increases which may also increase the risk and rate of default in addition the interest rates of floating rate loans typically only adjust to changes in shortterm interest rates long term interest rates can vary dramatically from short term interest rates therefore senior loans may not mitigate price declines in a rising longterm interest rate environment risk of restrictions on resale senior loans may not be readily marketable and may be subject to restrictions on resale as a result the ability of the fund to dispose of its investments in a timely fashion and at an advantageous price may be restricted ongoing monitoring risk on behalf of the several lenders the agent generally will be required to administer and manage the senior loans and with respect to collateralized senior loans to service or monitor the collateral sector concentration risk the fund may invest up to  of its assets in a single sector as a result the fund’s investment in fewer sectors may result in the fund’s shares being more sensitive to the economic results and other risks specific to those sectors an investment in the fund could fluctuate in value more than the
