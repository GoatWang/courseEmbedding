how i made it j mario molina and john molina  latimes advertisement you are here lat home→collections→clinicshow i made it j mario molina and john molinathe brothers expanded their fathers clinic business molina healthcare into facilities across the country that cater to patients on government medical assistancemay  by nathan olivarezgiles and darrell satzman the gig j mario molina and john molina who are brothers run molina healthcare inc a health maintenance organization provider that operates  clinics in  states the company based in long beach has  employees and more than  million customers most of whom receive medicaid medical and other government healthcare assistance last year the company took in  billion of which  million was profit founding father in  emergencyroom physician c david molina started molina healthcare after noticing an influx of patients in the er who had been turned away from doctors who wouldnt accept medical nobody wanted to take care of them said mario  chief executive of the company they would come in for sore throats and diaper rash kids with fevers and earaches things that werent really emergencies family business mario john and their three sisters all pitched in at the initial three clinics it was expected of us to help out mario said wed work at the reception desk wed paint the buildings sweep mop water plants mow the lawn wash windows clean bathrooms anything that needed to be done short of seeing patients different paths mario followed in his fathers footsteps and became a doctor attending medical school at usc john got a degree in economics from usc i was the exact opposite of mario and i was very squeamish said john  now chief financial officer of the company i didnt want to go hang out in the er but i loved doing payroll growing pains in  the company took over the lease on nine closed clinics formerly operated by maxicare corp to help pay for the expansion david molina took out a second mortgage on the family home we literally started those nine clinics empty mario said dad sent john and i out to recruit back all the people who were working for maxicare it took months to get going but patients eventually came back too twist of fate mario who aimed for a career in research was conducting diabetes studies at usc in  when molina healthcares medical director died unexpectedly mario took the job part time and continued on at usc until his father gave him a choice he said i really need someone to be a fulltime medical director if you want the job its yours if you dont im going to hire someone else mario said so i decided to leave academics and go with my dad on their own david molina died in  two months before the company was set to expand into utah dad had always been here and we worked very closely with him but all the big decisions were his mario said it was sort of like being on a high wire and then they take away your safety net john and i were young and a lot of people didnt think wed be able to pull it off but we did the brothers continued the companys expansion by purchasing hmo providers in washington state and michigan going public we had come to a fork in the road and it was clear that we couldnt continue to grow the way we wanted if we didnt get more capital mario said molina healthcare went public in  raising more than  million in its initial public offering the brothers used that money to expand further the revenue brought in from the growth of the company allowed molina healthcare to buy a health information management business from unisys corp that runs medicare programs under state contracts for  million in cash in january according to hispanic business magazine molina healthcare is now the secondlargest hispanicowned company in the us behind brightstar corp which provides distribution services for wireless firms obama boost the recently passed healthcare legislation could benefit molina healthcare mario said we serve primarily medicaid patients and the congressional budget office has estimated that with the obama healthcare changes another  to  million people that are uninsured now will be placed on medicaid over the next few years that will increase our potential customer base by about  risk as a business strategy if you look back at the history of the company each of our turning points as a company involved taking a risk john said when dad expanded from three to  clinics that was a risk when we expanded into utah after dad died that was risky too for some deals to buy a small health plan in another state or something like that weve had to scrape every penny we had together to pull it off it can be scary sometimes but we make the moves that we think will make the company better in the long term not just what will be the best in the short term nathanolivarezgileslatimescom moreseizure led to flojos deathhis  scores make his caserestaurant review south beverly grillbrutal murder by teenage girls adds to britons
