divorce the nicotine hit that smokers crave from the burning of tobacco vaping — inhaling nicotine in vapor form — can be done in all sorts of ways finding out what works and what doesnt is now a key part of the job for bats rd staff there’s been a transformation in rd in this company over the last  years moving away from what was a kind of fairly stable agricultural product to a consumer tech world says dr oreilly a £ billion market — and growing fast oscar williamsgrutbusiness insider rather than searching for the safer cigarette the main thrust of dr oreillys job now is to discover the products that smokers will be using five or ten years from now he says  this involves testing and developing bats own vape and ecigarette products looking at everything from safety standards to the quality of nicotine hit as well as scouring the market to look for next generation products that could become popular bat focuses on two main types of systems today vapes where nicotine is mixed with a flavor and an agent that can turn it into a vapor that can be inhaled and what are called tobacco heating products which heat tobacco to create an aerosol rather than burning it bat says this process produces smaller quantities of toxicants like carbon monoxide and formaldehyde when compared to cigarette smoke the market for these products is small ey estimated in a report earlier this year that electronic nicotine delivery systems as it calls them were worth £ billion last year that compares to a global cigarette market worth almost  billion but the market is growing fast ey expects nextgen nicotine will be worth £ billion by  the question is who will gain in that period of disruption and who won’t the garden at bats southampton rd facilityoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider bat has spent around  billion on rd over the last  years and also has centers in brazil malaysia indonesia russia and turkey the southampton site is the largest hub with  people employed there dr oreilly who sits on bats board says rd is of particular interest to the board at the moment probably three times a year we have our strategy away meetings rd takes up a sizeable proportion of that time it’s very much the heart of the business now particularly in these categories unless we have the best performing consumerline products we’re not going to be successful commercially  the company is in a development arms race philip morris international a big tobacco rival known for marlboros has spent over  billion on nextgeneration tobacco products according to bloomberg dr oreilly plays down the difference saying i get what i need to drive the rd programme it’s not a restriction on progress put it that way the question is who will gain in that period of disruption and who won’t he adds i’m very confident we will gain here because we’ve invested a lot for a long time in the science the technology the products that will transform the marketplace we’re very confident we’re going to be on the right side of the line on this we fail early fail fast and fail cheaply bats range of next generation productsoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider innovation in tobacco sounds a lot like innovation in the tech startup world it’s a core part of our innovation strategy that we fail early fail fast and fail cheaply dr oreilly says the mantra of fail fast was first pioneered by software developers but has seeped into the wider business world as tech has become more and more pervasive  we’ll have incremental improvement of current platforms and then we’ll have disruptive technologies dr oreilly says thats right — platforms like facebook but for smoking  he adds then of course when a product gets to the end of its relevance we delist it fairly quickly like all companies you have incremental innovation and then gamechanging disruptive technology coming through   where’s the next disruptive technology going to come from a packet of neosticks for bats tobacco heating product glo which is sold in japanoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider innovation in big tobacco is also bringing companies like bat into contact with the startup world bat has made several acquisitions in the vaping and ecigarette space since the turn of the decade i’ve got a whole function here purely based on disruptive technology dr oreilly explains it’s about  in that group dedicated to what we call new consumer technology platform they’re just looking out there where’s the next disruptive technology going to come from and when they identify them we can look to work with them acquire them develop the technology we become the disruptors it used to be very difficult to recruit into this sector that’s changed  degrees now another machine carrying out toxicity tests on bats vape productsoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider the recent transformation in rd has given bat a big boost when it comes to hiring dr oreilly says it used to be very difficult to recruit into this sector particularly in the rd world i’d say that’s changed  degrees now i’m getting high quality senior rd professionals from other fmcgs fastmoving consumer goods and beyond really wanting to work in this organization because what we’re doing is cutting edge it’s fast moving it’s changing the world in recent years bat has hired people away from companies like american food giant kraft heinz bacardi and pg the consumer goods giant behind head  shoulders shampoo and ariel detergent it’s very appleesque bats glo tobacco heating product which is popular in japanoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider becoming a next generation tobacco player means more than just mastering the technology it also means figuring out how to make sexy tech these are consumer electronic products they have to look good as well as work really well says dr oreilly bat works with design and branding agencies who are usually found working with funky californian tech startups dr oreilly says consumers when they move to vaping no longer want to see themselves as a tobacco consumer actually a tobacco brand is not helpful he picks up glo bats tobacco heating product sold in japan it is a brushed steel box with lit up button that changes colour to tell people the tobacco stick that is holstered in it is hot enough to take a drag on dr oreilly says people have likened this to — it’s very appleesque a colorful vype product known as the pebble sits nearby reminiscent of an early flip phone other vaping pens look like a stylus from a touch screen computer we should be allowed to innovate rapidly vypes pebble productoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider of course while bat may like to think of itself inline with apple regulators do not governments and scientists around the world see it as a tobacco company and treat it as such marketing rules and taxation of vaping and tobacco heating products vary around the world but in many countries they are as strict as rules for cigarettes dr oreilly wants regulators to give companies like bat what he calls more freedom when it comes to new products we should be allowed to innovate rapidly he says  we should be allowed to communicate to consumers on these products in terms of advertising and marketing there should be greater freedoms than you see for cigarettes there are  billion lives at stake a chart on the wall at bats facility showing the level of toxins in glo and vype products compared to a traditional cigaretteoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider why should regulators and governments give big tobacco a break after a history of bad behavior in the sector dr oreilly is keen to paint his rd efforts as part of a public health battle rather than a hunt for profit in the th century its estimated that  million people died prematurely from cigarette smoking he says in the st century its predicted to be  billion there are  billion lives at stake it sounds rather pious coming from a company that built its business on the back of those  million people philip morris international bats rival has said it wants to reach a smokefree future — essentially promising to eliminate its core product can bat commit to that every right thinking person would want a smokefree future or more specifically a future without smokingrelated disease and death says dr oreilly where we may differ with philip morris is on how long that may take it’s a long journey we have to manage expectations we can’t tell consumers what to do all we can do is give them great choices and those choices should be lifesaving choices that’s our strategy that’s how we intend to compete and win in these new categories however bat shows no signs of slowing down its cigarette manufacturing to encourage a shift  safer than smoking a comparison of the toxins released from a cigarette and an ecigarette alongside a blank receptacleoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider from a public health standpoint vaping appears to be healthier than smoking — especially for people who are using vaping to quit still for young people who have never smoked research from the us centers for disease control and prevention and the university of hawaii cancer centre suggests it could pose a substantial risk as teens who try ecigs are three times more likely to take up smoking that said bats business is not built solely on vaping the company also has iglo its tobacco heating product that it sells in japan and recently launched in canada bats own internal tests suggest that like vaping tobacco heating products are less harmful than cigarettes  however there are fewer external studies verifying these findings and internal testing by companies is largely seen as unreliable in the science community unless verified by a third party such as the us food and drug administration in its release announcing the launch of iglo in canada bat says it delivers delivers a cleaner experience but admits in a footnote these qualities do not necessarily mean that this product produces less adverse health effects than other tobacco products it’s unfortunate because there are a lot of great universities in the uk that we’d like to work with a testing lab at the southampton siteoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider much of bats efforts at the southampton site go into demonstrating that its new products are safe and healthier than cigarettes we are world leaders in in vitro testing says dr oreilly it’s like lung on a plate if you like then we can expose these systems to the cigarettes and various devices universities in britain have boycotted working with tobacco companies since the early s after pressure from charities such as cancer research uk dr oreilly says it’s unfortunate because there are a lot of great universities in the uk that we’d like to work with obviously as a multinational company there are lots of other universities we can work with whether in europe or the united states it’s a shame we can do the work just not here in the uk a smokefree future is not going to happen in my professional lifetime a machine that mimics the effect of taking a drag on a cigarette or vape machineoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider dr oreilly doesnt see the boycott changing anytime soon in part because bat expects cigarettes to be around for a long while yet we project  years into the future on average give or take and that’s a rolling projection in  years time we still think a sizeable percentage of tobacco consumption will still be in the cigarette it just will be we can’t change that certainly a smokefree future is not going to happen in my professional lifetime or the ceo’s professional lifetime the generation that follows let’s see it’ll take many years we think and that’s just being realistic we think it’s not lack of ambition we’re doing everything we can this is not a developed vs developing market thing for us one of bats vype pensoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider a cynic might say that bat and its rivals are investing next generation nicotine products to help combat declining smoking rates in the developed world where the dangers of smoking have been drilled into peoples mind for years new products mean new revenues to combat the decline if bat is really out to save  billion lives why not focus on marketing vype products in indonesia where over twothirds of adult men smoke market selection is a complicated subject dr oreilly says there’s got to be sequencing you can’t roll out everything everywhere at the same time not in this industry these are quite complex products each product has to be modified for each market changed for regulation dr oreillys insists that next generation products are not a developed vs developing market thing bat but recent studies have found that big tobacco companies take a different approach to emerging markets with studies suggesting some such as bats rival reynolds appearing to still market products to the young dr oreilly hits back if you look at the footprint of bat we are very big in the developing world why would we not take next generation products there it’s not that this is for the rich if you want to get rid of cigarette smoking you have to give people somewhere to go bats vype productsoscar williamsgrutbusiness insider the uk is the biggest market in the world for nextgeneration nicotine products with  of the population vaping in one way or another according to ey its popularity is partly down to the regulation here which is some of the most progressive in the world dr oreilly says elsewhere in the world vaping and tobacco heating products are banned something dr oreilly sees as counterintuitive if you want to get rid of cigarette smoking you have to give people somewhere to go he says i feel incredibly fortunate to be in this job oscar williamsgrutbusiness insider dr oreilly has been with bat for  years now and has been group scientific and rd director since  but he feels that his current role is perhaps his most exciting i feel incredibly fortunate to be in this job in this moment of our history compared to my predecessors of many years ago who were in a much more static and undynamic environment he says as well as the vaping revolution bat is in the midst of a huge  billion merger with us rival reynolds which will create the worlds largest listed tobacco company bat already has an innovation agreement with rai innovations a subsidiary of reynolds created last year to focus on next generation nicotine products once the deal completes dr oreilly will doubtless have even more resources at his disposal to drive innovation bats next gen products are currently sold in  markets and the company hopes to double that in  then double it again in  he says it’s a really exciting time particularly to be the rd
