questions you might have about our product  service and provide the answers here if you need additional information send an email to supportftbeamraycom or beamraylycoscom    what products do you offer and what is the price we have  models available the portable unit is  it comes standard with a built in monitor dual light assembly and fans light stand keyboard instructional dvd and manual  the nonportable unit is  it comes standard with a dual light assembly and fans light stand keyboard instructional dvd and manual you will need to supply your own vga compatible monitor for this model  we also sell replacement bulbs for  each   does your generator come with frequencies loaded or do i have to do that our units currently come loaded with  program listings they are by name alphabetically you simply choose the program you want to run there is also room for thousands more to be added should you needwant to    do you have to listen to the volume while running the program no you may turn down the volume and still get the same effect the sound adjustment knob is there for those who enjoy hearing the frequencies    how will i know when i need a new bulb when it no longer fully lights the tube or only partially lights as long as your bulb is fully lit it is fine due to the nature of the gasses the glass will darken with use that is perfectly fine and normal nothing to be concerned about   my bulb will not light do i need a new one possibly however first check to make sure your power knob is turned up also check the fuse in the back of the unit black spring loaded knob labeled fuse to make sure it is not blown    do you ever have updates to the programming available yes we recommend you call or email our office once a year or so to check on anything new if weve had an update well be happy to send it to you this is a service we offer free of charge to our clients those who have bought used equipment will only have to pay a small fee we are currently running software v you can check the version that you are running by looking at the top and center of your menu screen  do i have to be naked to use the unit absolutely not however while you may wear whatever is comfortable to you we recommend that you minimize any metal objects such as jewelry or belt buckles  how close should i be from the bulb for a single client we recommend  feet away for each additional client in the session add an additional  feet away for an entire room of clients simply place the tube holder in the corner of the room to cover the entire space  why is the light flashing on certain steps and solid on others on steps that are doing a sweep of frequencies the light will be solid steps that have a pulse jackhammer effect on the target will blink also frequencies under hz have a natural pulse so those will also blink   can i run the unit while i sleep at night we do not generally recommend running the unit while you sleep it can interfere with the circadian rhythm as the body needs that sleeping time to rest and repair however everyone has their own preferences and some do use it during sleeping hours   do you sell used equipment or buy back used equipment we do not sell used units however from time to time we do have refurbished units for sale we do not buy back used equipment but we can put you on our looking to sell list we give that list to people who call looking for used units we also recommend you try selling on ebay  my monitor says no input signal what is wrong that is an issue with your monitor it has nothing to do with the beam ray check to make sure the monitor is snuggly plugged into the back of the beam ray  what is the turn around time for repairs  on average  business days   what is the warranty on the unit and bulbs our units come with a standard warranty  year parts and  days labor the bulbs are guaranteed for  months from purchase date    what forms of payment do you accept we accept visa mastercard discover paypal or you can

customizationmodifications are final no refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process all house plans from houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed in addition to the house plans you order you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property you might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region your home builder can usually help you with this you may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system many areas now have areaspecific energy codes that also have to be followed this normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance in some regions there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes some areas of north america have very strict engineering requirements examples of this would be but not limited to earthquakeprone areas of california and the pacific coast hurricane risk areas of the florida gulf  carolina coasts new york new jersey nevada and parts of illinois require review by a local professional as well if you are building in these areas it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department if you aren’t sure building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit additionally stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached if your building department requires one they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build in this case you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping in addition plans which are used to construct homes in nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed nevada architect × best price policy some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs we are committed to selling
