which may be managed by a funds portfolio managers while a fund may have many similarities to these other funds its investment performance will differ from their investment performance this is due to a number of differences between the fund and these similar products including differences in sales charges expense ratios and cash flows the series fund also offers its shares to other separate accounts established by the company and our new york subsidiary in connection with variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts although we do not anticipate any disadvantages to this arrangement there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of the variable account and one or more of the other separate accounts investing in the series fund a conflict may occur due to differences in tax laws affecting the operations of variable life and variable annuity separate accounts or some other reason we and the series funds board of trustees will

restrictions expenses and potential risks of each fund may be found in the accompanying current series fund prospectus you should read the series fund prospectus carefully before investing the statement of additional information of the series fund is available by calling   the fixed account the fixed account is made up of all the general assets of the company other than those allocated to any separate account amounts you allocate to guarantee periods become part of the fixed account and are available to fund the claims of all classes of our customers including claims for benefits under the contracts we will invest the assets of the fixed account in those assets we choose that are allowed by applicable state insurance laws in general these laws permit investments within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications in federal state and municipal obligations corporate bonds preferred and common stocks real estate mortgages real estate and certain other investments we intend to invest primarily in investmentgrade fixed income securities ie rated by a nationally recognized rating service within the  highest grades or instruments we believe are of comparable quality we are not obligated to invest amounts allocated to the fixed account according to any particular strategy except as may be required by applicable state insurance laws you will not have a direct or indirect interest in the fixed account investments the fixed account options the guarantee periods   you may elect one or more guarantee periods from those we make available from time to time we may offer guarantee periods of different durations or stop offering some guarantee periods once we stop offering a guarantee period of a particular duration allocations transfers or renewals into that guarantee period will not be permitted we publish guaranteed interest rates for each guarantee period offered we may change the guaranteed interest rates we offer from time to time but no guaranteed interest rate will ever be less than the minimum guaranteed rate permitted by state law also once we have accepted your allocation to a particular guarantee period we promise that the guaranteed interest rate applicable to that allocation will not change for the duration of the guarantee period we determine guaranteed interest rates at our discretion we do not have a specific formula for establishing the rates for different guarantee periods our determination will be influenced by the interest rates on fixed income investments in which we may invest amounts allocated to the guarantee periods we will also consider other factors in determining these rates including regulatory and tax requirements sales commissions and administrative expenses borne by us general economic trends and competitive factors we cannot predict the level of future interest rates we may from time to time at our discretion offer special interest rates for new purchase payments that are higher than the rates we are then offering for renewals or transfers early withdrawals from your allocation to a guarantee period including cash withdrawals transfers and commencement of an annuity option may be subject to a market value adjustment which could decrease or increase the value of your account see withdrawals withdrawal charge and market value adjustment the accumulation phase during the accumulation phase of your contract you make payments into your account and your earnings accumulate on a taxdeferred basis the accumulation phase begins with our acceptance of your first purchase payment and ends the business day before your annuity commencement date the accumulation phase will end sooner if you surrender your contract or if the covered person dies before the annuity commencement date issuing your contract when you purchase a contract a completed application and the initial purchase payment are sent to us for acceptance when we accept an individual contract we issue the contract to you when we accept a group contract we issue the contract to the owner we issue a certificate to you as a participant we will credit your initial purchase payment to your account within  business days of receiving your completed application if your application is not complete we will notify you if we do not have the necessary information to complete the application within  business days we will send your money back to you or ask your permission to retain your purchase payment until the application is made complete then we will apply the purchase payment within  business days of when the application is complete amount and frequency of purchase payments the amount of purchase payments may vary however we will not accept an initial purchase payment of less than  and each additional purchase payment must be at least  unless we waive these limits in addition we will not accept a purchase payment if your account value is over  million or if the purchase payment would cause your account value to exceed  million unless we have approved the payment in advance within these limits you may make purchase payments at any time during the accumulation phase allocation of net purchase payments you may allocate your purchase payments among the different subaccounts and guarantee periods we offer but any allocation to a guarantee period must be at least  over the life of your contract you may allocate amounts among as many as  of the available investment options in your application you may specify the percentage of each purchase payment to be allocated to each subaccount or guarantee period these percentages are called your allocation factors your allocation factors will remain in effect as long as your selected subaccounts and guarantee periods continue to be available for investment you may however change the allocation factors for future payments by sending us notice of the change in a form acceptable to us we will use your new allocation factors for the first purchase payment we receive with or after we have received notice of the change and for all future purchase payments until we receive another change notice although it is currently not our practice we may deduct applicable premium taxes or similar taxes from your purchase payments see contract charges  premium taxes in that case we will credit your net purchase payment which is the purchase payment minus the amount of those taxes your account when we accept your first purchase payment we establish an account for you which we maintain throughout the accumulation phase of your contract your account value your account value is the sum of the value of the  components of your contract the variable account portion of your contract variable account value and the fixed account portion of your contract fixed account value these  components are calculated separately as described below under variable account value and fixed account value variable account value      variable accumulation units in order to calculate your variable account value we use a measure called a variable accumulation unit for each subaccount your variable account value is the sum of your account value in each subaccount which is the number of your variable accumulation units for that subaccount times the value of each unit      variable accumulation unit value the value of each variable accumulation unit in a subaccount reflects the net investment performance of that subaccount we determine that value once on each day that the new york stock exchange is open for trading at the close of trading which is currently  pm eastern time the close of trading is determined by the new york stock exchange we also may determine the value of variable accumulation units of a subaccount on days the exchange is closed if there is enough trading in securities held by that subaccount to materially affect the value of the variable accumulation units each day we make a valuation is called a business day the period that begins at the time variable accumulation units are valued on a business day and ends at that time on the next business day is called a valuation period on days other than business days the value of a variable accumulation unit does not change to measure these values we use a factor  which we call the net investment factor  which represents the net return on the subaccounts assets at the end of any valuation period the value of a variable accumulation unit for a subaccount is equal to the value of that subaccounts variable accumulation units at the end of the previous valuation period multiplied by the net investment factor we calculate the net investment factor by dividing  the net asset value of a fund share held in the subaccount at the end of that valuation period plus the per share amount of any dividend or capital gains distribution made by that fund during the valuation period by  the net asset value per share of the fund share at the end of the previous valuation period then for each day in the valuation period we deduct a factor representing the assetbased insurance charges the mortality and expense risk charges and the administrative expense charge plus any applicable charge for optional death benefit riders see contract charges for a hypothetical example of how we calculate the value of a variable accumulation unit see the statement of additional information      crediting and canceling variable accumulation units when we receive an allocation to a subaccount either from a net purchase payment or a transfer of account value we credit that amount to your account in variable accumulation units similarly we cancel variable accumulation units when you transfer or withdraw amounts from a subaccount or when we deduct certain charges under the contract we determine the number of units credited or canceled by dividing the dollar amount by the variable accumulation unit value for that subaccount at the end of the valuation period during which the transaction or charge is effective fixed account value your fixed account value is the sum of all amounts allocated to guarantee periods either from net purchase payments transfers or renewals plus interest credited on those amounts and minus withdrawals transfers out of guarantee periods and any deductions for charges under the contract taken from your fixed account value a guarantee period begins the day we apply your allocation and ends when all calendar years or months if the guarantee period is less than one year in the guarantee period measured from the end of the calendar month in which the amount was allocated to the guarantee period have elapsed the last day of the guarantee period is its renewal date each additional purchase payment transfer or renewal credited to your fixed account value will result in a new guarantee period with its own renewal date amounts allocated at different times to guarantee periods of the same duration may have different renewal dates      crediting interest we credit interest on amounts allocated to a guarantee period at the applicable guaranteed interest rate for the duration of the guarantee period during the guarantee period we credit interest daily at a rate that yields the guaranteed interest rate on an annual effective basis      guarantee amounts each separate allocation you make to a guarantee period together with interest credited thereon is called a guarantee amount each guarantee amount is treated separately for purposes of determining the market value adjustment we may restrict a guarantee period that will extend beyond your maximum annuity commencement date renewals into a guarantee period that will extend beyond your maximum annuity commencement date will result in an application of a market value adjustment upon annuitization or withdrawals each new allocation to a guarantee period must be at least       renewals we will notify you in writing between  and  days before the renewal date for any guarantee amount if you would like to change your fixed account option we must receive from you prior to the renewal date  written notice electing a different guarantee period from among those we then offer or      written instructions to transfer the guarantee amount to one or more subaccounts in accordance with the transfer privilege provisions of the contract see transfer privilege if we receive no instructions from you prior to the renewal date we will automatically renew your fixed account allocation into a new guarantee period of the same duration as the last guarantee period if we are no longer offering a guarantee period of the same duration we will automatically transfer your fixed account allocation into the money market subaccount a guarantee amount will not renew into a guarantee period that will extend beyond your maximum annuity commencement date in that case unless you notify us otherwise we will automatically renew your guarantee amount into the money market subaccount      early withdrawals if you withdraw transfer or annuitize an allocation to a guarantee period  days prior to the renewal date we will apply a market value adjustment to the transaction this could result in an increase or a decrease of your account value depending on interest rates at the time you bear the risk that you will receive less than your principal if the market value adjustment applies transfer privilege      permitted transfers during the accumulation phase you may transfer all or part of your account value to one or more subaccounts or guarantee periods then available subject to the following restrictions   you may not make more than  transfers in any account year       the amount transferred from a subaccount must be at least  unless you are transferring your entire balance in that subaccount       your account value remaining in a subaccount must be at least        the amount transferred from a guarantee period must be the entire guarantee amount except for transfers of interest credited during the current account year       at least  days must elapse between transfers to and from guarantee periods       transfers to or from subaccounts are subject to terms and conditions that may be imposed by the funds       the total number of subaccounts and guarantee periods within an account may not exceed  over the lifetime of the contract and       we impose additional restrictions on market timers which are further described below these restrictions do not apply to transfers made under any approved optional program at our discretion we may waive some or all of these restrictions   there is usually no charge imposed on transfers however we reserve the right to impose a transfer charge of  for each transfer transfers out of a guarantee period more than  days before the renewal date or any time after the renewal date or any time after the renewal date will be subject to the market value adjustment described below under current law there is no tax liability for transfers      requests for transfers you may request transfers in writing or by telephone if the request is by telephone it must be made before the earlier of a  pm eastern time on a business day or b the close of the new york stock exchange on days that the stock exchange closes before  pm otherwise your transfer request will be effective on the next business day the telephone transfer privilege is available automatically and does not require your written election we will require personal identifying information to process a request for a transfer made by telephone we will not be liable for following instructions communicated by telephone that we reasonably believe are genuine your transfer request will be effective as of the close of the business day if we receive your transfer request before the earlier of a  pm eastern time on a business day or b the close of the new york stock exchange on days that the stock exchange closes before  pm otherwise your transfer request will be effective on the next business day      market timers the contracts are not designed for professional market timing organizations or other entities using programmed and frequent transfers if you wish to employ such strategies you should not purchase a contract accordingly transfers may be subject to restrictions if exercised by a market timing firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transfer transactions on behalf of multiple participants in imposing such restrictions we may among other things not accept  the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one participant or  the transfer instructions of individual participants who have executed preauthorized transfer forms that are submitted at the same time by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one participant we will not impose these restrictions unless our actions are reasonably intended to prevent the use of such transfers in a manner that will disadvantage or potentially impair the contract rights of other participants in addition the series fund has reserved the right to temporarily or permanently refuse exchange requests from the variable account if in mfs judgment a fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective and policies or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected in particular a pattern of exchanges that coincide with a market timing strategy may be disruptive to a fund and therefore may be refused accordingly the variable account may not be in a position to effectuate transfers and may refuse transfer requests without prior notice we also reserve the right for similar reasons to refuse or delay exchange requests involving transfers to or from the fixed account waivers reduced charges credits special guaranteed interest rates we may reduce or waive the withdrawal charge mortality and expense risk charges the administrative service fee or the annual account fee credit additional amounts grant special guaranteed interest rates in certain situations or offer other options or benefits these situations may include sales of contracts  where selling andor maintenance costs associated with the contracts are reduced such as the sale of several contracts to the same participant sales of large contracts and certain group sales and  to officers directors and employees of the company or its affiliates registered representatives and employees of brokerdealers with a current selling agreement with the company and affiliates of such representatives and brokerdealers employees of affiliated asset management firms and persons who have retired from such positions eligible employees and immediate family members of eligible employees eligible employees and their immediate family members may also purchase a contract without regard to minimum purchase payment requirements for other situations in which withdrawal charges may be waived see withdrawals withdrawal charge and market value adjustment optional programs      dollarcost averaging dollarcost averaging allows you to invest gradually over time in up to  subaccounts you may select a dollarcost averaging program at no extra charge by allocating a minimum of  to a designated subaccount or to a guarantee period we make available in connection with the program amounts allocated to the fixed account under the program will earn interest at a rate declared by the company for the guarantee period you select previously applied amounts may not be transferred to a guarantee period made available in connection with this program at regular time intervals we will transfer the same amount automatically to one or more subaccounts that you choose up to a maximum of  subaccounts the program continues until your account value allocated to the program is depleted or you elect to stop the program the final amount transferred from the fixed account will include all interest earned no market value adjustment either positive or negative will apply to amounts automatically transferred from the fixed account under the dollarcost averaging program however if you discontinue or alter the program prior to completion amounts remaining in the fixed account will be transferred to the money market fund investment option under the contract unless you instruct us otherwise and the market value adjustment will be applied any new allocation of a purchase payment to the program will be treated as commencing a new dollarcost averaging program and is subject to the  minimum the main objective of a dollarcost averaging program is to minimize the impact of shortterm price fluctuations on account value in general since you transfer the same dollar amount to the variable investment options at set intervals dollarcost averaging allows you to purchase more variable accumulation units and indirectly more fund shares when prices are low and fewer variable accumulation units and indirectly fewer fund shares when prices are high therefore you may achieve a lower average cost per variable accumulation unit over the long term a dollarcost averaging program allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations however it is important to understand that a dollarcost averaging program does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market we do not allow transfers into any of the guarantee periods      asset allocation one or more asset allocation programs may be available in connection with the contract at no extra charge asset allocation is the process of investing in different asset classes  such as equity funds fixed income funds and money market funds  depending on your personal investment goals tolerance for risk and investment time horizon by spreading your money among a variety of asset classes you may be able to reduce the risk and volatility of investing although there are no guarantees and asset allocation does not insure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market currently you may select one of the available asset allocation models each of which represents a combination of subaccounts with a different level of risk these models as well as the terms and conditions of the asset allocation program are fully described in a separate brochure we may add or delete programs in the future if you elect an asset allocation program we will automatically allocate your purchase payments among the subaccounts represented in the model you choose by electing an asset allocation program you thereby authorize us to automatically reallocate your investment options as determined by the terms of the asset allocation program to reflect the current composition of the model you have selected without further instruction until we receive notification that you wish to terminate the program or choose a different model      systematic withdrawal program if you have an account value of  or more you may select our systematic withdrawal program under this program you determine the amount and frequency of regular withdrawals you would like to receive from your fixed account value andor variable account value and we will effect them automatically the withdrawals under this program may be subject to surrender charges or a market value adjustment they may also be included as income and subject to a  federal tax penalty you should consult your tax adviser before choosing this option you may change or stop this program at any time by written notice to us      portfolio rebalancing program under the portfolio rebalancing program we transfer funds among all subaccounts to maintain the percentage allocation you have selected among these subaccounts at your election we will make these transfers on a quarterly semiannual or annual basis portfolio rebalancing does not permit transfers to or from any guarantee period      secured future program under the secured future program we divide your purchase payments between the fixed account and the variable account for the fixed account portion you choose a guarantee period from among those we offer we then allocate to that guarantee period the portion of your purchase payment necessary so that at the end of the guarantee period your fixed account allocation including interest will equal the entire amount of your original purchase payment the remainder of the original purchase payment will be invested in the subaccounts of your choice at the end of the guarantee period you will be guaranteed the amount of your original purchase payment assuming no withdrawals plus you will have the benefit if any of the investment performance of the subaccounts you have chosen withdrawals withdrawal charge and market value adjustment cash withdrawals      requesting a withdrawal at any time during the accumulation phase you may withdraw in cash all or any portion of your account value to make a withdrawal you must send us a written request at our annuity mailing address your request must specify whether you want to withdraw the entire amount of your account or if less the amount you wish to receive all withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge see withdrawal charge and withdrawals from your fixed account value also may be subject to a market value adjustment see market value adjustment withdrawals also may have adverse income tax consequences including a  penalty tax see tax considerations you should carefully consider these tax consequences before requesting a cash withdrawal      full withdrawals if you request a full withdrawal we calculate the amount we will pay you as follows we start with the total value of your account at the end of the valuation period during which we receive your withdrawal request we deduct the account fee for the account year in which the withdrawal is made we add or subtract the amount of any market value adjustment applicable to your fixed account value and finally we deduct any applicable withdrawal charge a full withdrawal results in the surrender of your contract and cancellation of all rights and privileges under your contract      partial withdrawals if you request a partial withdrawal we will pay you the actual amount specified in your request and then adjust the value of your account by deducting the amount paid adding or deducting any market value adjustment applicable to amounts withdrawn from the fixed account and deducting any applicable withdrawal charge you may specify the amount you want withdrawn from each subaccount andor guarantee amount to which your account is allocated if you do not so specify we will deduct the total amount you request pro rata based on your account value at the end of the valuation period during which we receive your request if you request a partial withdrawal that would result in your account value being reduced to an amount less than the account fee for the account year in which you make the withdrawal we will treat it as a request for a full withdrawal      time of payment we will pay you the applicable amount of any full or partial withdrawal within  days after we receive your withdrawal request except in cases where we are permitted and choose to defer payment under the investment company act of  and applicable state insurance law currently we may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the variable account only for the following periods  when the new york stock exchange is closed except weekends and holidays or when trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted      when it is not reasonably practical to dispose of securities held by a fund or to determine the value of the net assets of a fund because an emergency exists or      when an sec order permits us to defer payment for the protection of participants we also may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the fixed account for up to  months from the date we receive your withdrawal request we do not pay interest on the amount of any payments we defer      withdrawal restrictions for qualified plans if your contract is a qualified contract you should carefully check the terms of your retirement plan for limitations and restrictions on cash withdrawals special restrictions apply to withdrawals from contracts used for section b annuities see tax considerations  taxsheltered annuities withdrawal charge we do not deduct any sales charge from your purchase payments when they are made however we may impose a withdrawal charge known as a contingent deferred sales charge on certain amounts you withdraw we impose this charge to defray some of our expenses related to the sale of the contracts such as commissions we pay to agents the cost of sales literature and other promotional costs and transaction expenses      free withdrawal amount in each account year you may withdraw a portion of your account value  which we call the free withdrawal amount  before incurring the withdrawal charge the free withdrawal amount is equal to  of the amount of all purchase payments you have made after the fourth account anniversary any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges the free withdrawal amount that you do not use in an account year is not cumulative in other words it will not be carried forward or available for use in future account years for an example of how we calculate the free withdrawal amount see appendix b      withdrawal charge on purchase payments if you withdraw more than the free withdrawal amount in any account year we consider the excess amount to be withdrawn first from payments that you have not previously withdrawn we impose the withdrawal charge on the amount of these payments thus the maximum amount on which we will impose the withdrawal charge in any year will never be more than the total of all payments that you have not previously withdrawn the amount of your withdrawal if any that exceeds the total of the free withdrawal amount plus the aggregate amount of all payments not previously withdrawn is not subject to the withdrawal charge      order of withdrawal when you make a withdrawal we consider the free withdrawal amount to be withdrawn first we consider purchase payments that you have not already withdrawn to be withdrawn next once all purchase payments are withdrawn the balance withdrawn is considered to be earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge      calculation of withdrawal charge we calculate the amount of the withdrawal charge by multiplying the amount you withdraw by a percentage as set forth below the percentage decreases according to the number of complete account years since your contract date after your fourth account anniversary any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges number of   account years   since your withdrawal contract date charge          or more  the withdrawal charge will never be greater than  of the excess of your account value over the free withdrawal amount as defined above for a group contract we may modify the withdrawal charges and limits upon notice to the owner of the group contract however any modification will apply only to accounts established after the date of the modification for additional examples of how we calculate withdrawal charges see appendix b types of withdrawals not subject to withdrawal charge      nursing home waiver if approved by your state we will waive the withdrawal charge for a full or partial withdrawal if  at least one year has passed since we issued your contract and      you are confined to an eligible nursing home and have been confined there for at least the preceding  days or any shorter period required by your state an eligible nursing home means a licensed hospital or licensed skilled or intermediate care nursing facility at which medical treatment is available on a daily basis and daily medical records are kept for each patient you must provide us evidence of confinement in the form we determine      minimum distributions for each qualified contract the free withdrawal amount in any account year will be the greater of the free withdrawal amount described above or any amounts required to be withdrawn to comply with the minimum distribution requirement of the internal revenue code this waiver of the withdrawal charge applies only to the portion of the required minimum distribution attributable to that qualified contract      other withdrawals we do not impose the withdrawal charge on amounts you apply to provide an annuity amounts we pay as a death benefit except under the cash surrender method or amounts you transfer among the subaccounts between the subaccounts and the fixed account or within the fixed account market value adjustment if permitted under the laws of your state we will apply a market value adjustment if you withdraw or transfer amounts from your fixed account value more than  days before the end of the applicable guarantee period for this purpose using fixed account value to provide an annuity is considered a withdrawal and the market value adjustment will apply however we will not apply the market value adjustment to automatic transfers to a subaccount from a guarantee period as part of our dollarcost averaging program we apply the market value adjustment separately to each guarantee amount in the fixed account that is to each separate allocation you have made to a guarantee period together with interest credited on that allocation however we do not apply the adjustment to the amount of interest credited during your current account year any withdrawal from a guarantee amount is attributed first to such interest a market value adjustment may decrease increase or have no effect on your account value this will depend on changes in interest rates since you made your allocation to the guarantee period and the length of time remaining in the guarantee period in general if the guaranteed interest rate we currently declare for guarantee periods equal to the balance of your guarantee period or your entire guarantee period for guarantee periods of less than one year is higher than your guaranteed interest rate the market value adjustment is likely to decrease your account value if our current guaranteed interest rate is lower the market value adjustment is likely to increase your account value we determine the amount of the market value adjustment by multiplying the amount that is subject to the adjustment by the following formula   i    j  b  n    where i is the guaranteed interest rate applicable to the guarantee amount from which you withdraw transfer or annuitize     j is the guaranteed interest rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal transfer or annuitization for guarantee periods equal to the length of time remaining in the guarantee period applicable to your guarantee amount rounded to the next higher number of complete years for guarantee periods of one year or more for any guarantee periods of less than one year j is the guaranteed interest rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal transfer or annuitization for a guarantee period of the same length as your guarantee period if at that time we do not offer the applicable guarantee period we will use an interest rate determined by straightline interpolation of the guaranteed interest rates for the guarantee periods we do offer n is the number of complete months remaining in your guarantee period and     b is a factor that currently is  but that in the future we may increase to up to  any increase would be applicable only to participants who purchase their contracts after the date of that increase the b factor is the amount that will be used to cover market volatility ie credit risk basis risk and or liquidity costs we will apply the market value adjustment to the amount being withdrawn after deduction of any account fee if applicable but before we impose any withdrawal charge on the amount withdrawn for examples of how we calculate the market value adjustment see appendix b contract charges account fee during the accumulation phase of your contract we will deduct from your account an annual account fee of  to help cover the administrative expenses we incur related to the issuance of contracts and the maintenance of accounts we deduct the account fee on each account anniversary we deduct the account fee pro rata from each subaccount and each guarantee period based on the allocation of your account value on your account anniversary we will not charge the account fee if  your account has been allocated only to the fixed account during the applicable account year or      your account value is  or more on your account anniversary if you make a full withdrawal of your account we will deduct the full amount of the account fee at the time of the withdrawal in addition on the annuity commencement date we will deduct a pro rata portion of the account fee to reflect the time elapsed between the last account anniversary and the day before the annuity commencement date after the annuity commencement date we will deduct an annual account fee of  in the aggregate in equal amounts from each variable annuity payment we make during the year we do not deduct any account fee from fixed annuity payments administrative expense charge we deduct an administrative expense charge from the assets of the variable account at an annual effective rate equal to  during both the accumulation phase and the income phase this charge is designed to reimburse us for expenses we incur in administering the contracts participant accounts and the variable account that are not covered by the annual account fee mortality and expense risk charge during both the accumulation phase and the income phase we deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the variable account at an effective annual rate equal to  if your initial purchase payment was less than  or  if your initial purchase payment was  or more the mortality risk we assume arises from our contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments to each annuitant regardless of how long the annuitant lives and regardless of how long all annuitants as a group live this obligation assures each annuitant that neither the longevity of fellow annuitants nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the amount of any annuity payment received under the contract the mortality risk also arises from our contractual obligation to pay a death benefit upon the death of the participant prior to the annuity commencement date the expense risk we assume is the risk that the annual account fee and the administrative expense charge we assess under the contract may be insufficient to cover the actual total administrative expenses we incur if the amount of the charge is insufficient to cover the mortality and expense risks we will bear the loss if the amount of the charge is more than sufficient to cover the risks we will make a profit on the charge we may use this profit for any proper corporate purpose including the payment of marketing and distribution expenses for the contract charges for optional death benefit riders if you elect an optional death benefit rider we will deduct during the accumulation phase a charge from the assets of the variable account depending upon which of the optional death benefit riders you elect    of average riders you

applicable premium taxes currently range from  to  you should consult a tax adviser to find out if your state imposes a premium tax and the amount of any tax in order to reimburse us for the premium tax we may pay on purchase payments our policy is to deduct the amount of such taxes from the amount you apply to provide an annuity at the time of annuitization however we reserve the right to deduct the amount of any applicable tax from your account at any time including at the time you make a purchase payment or make a full or partial withdrawal we do not make any profit on the deductions we make to reimburse premium taxes fund expenses there are fees and charges deducted from each fund these fees and expenses are described in the fund prospectuses and related statements of additional information modification in the case of group contracts for group contracts we may modify the annual account fee the administrative expense charge and the mortality and expense risk charge upon notice to owners however such modification will apply only with respect to participant accounts established after the effective date of the modification death benefit if the covered person dies during the accumulation phase we will pay a death benefit to your beneficiary using the payment method elected a single cash payment or one of our annuity options if the beneficiary is not living on the date of death of the covered person we will pay the death benefit in one sum to your estate we do not pay a death benefit if the covered person dies during the income phase however the beneficiary will

 or  of the basic death benefit or under any of the optional death benefit riders your account value may be increased by the excess if any of that amount over option  of the basic death benefit any such increase will be allocated to the subaccounts in proportion to your account value in those subaccounts on the death benefit date such increase will be made only if the beneficiary elects to annuitize elects to defer annuitization or elects to continue the contract also any portion of this new account value attributed to the fixed account will be transferred to the available money market fund investment option without the application of a market value adjustment if your spouse as the named beneficiary elects to continue the contract after your death your spouse may transfer any such fixed account portion back to the fixed account and begin a new guarantee period method of paying death benefit the death benefit may be paid in a single cash payment or as an annuity either fixed variable or a combination under one or more of our annuity options we describe the annuity options in this prospectus under the income phase  annuity provisions during the accumulation phase you may elect the method of payment for the death benefit if no such election is in effect on the date of your death the beneficiary may elect either a single cash payment or an annuity if the beneficiary is your spouse the beneficiary may elect to continue the contract these elections are made by sending us a completed election form which we will provide if we do not receive the beneficiarys election within  days after we receive due proof of death we will pay the death benefit in a single cash payment if we pay the death benefit in the form of an annuity option the beneficiary becomes the

participant automatically becomes the designated beneficiary if the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse your spouse may continue the contract in his or her own name as participant to make this election your spouse must give us written notification within  days after we receive due proof of death the special distribution rules will then apply on the death of your spouse to understand what happens when your spouse continues the contract see spousal continuance above during the income phase if the annuitant dies the remaining value of the annuity option in place must be distributed at least as rapidly as the method of distribution under that option if the participant is not a natural person these distribution rules apply upon the death of any annuitant payments made in contravention of these special rules would adversely affect the treatment of the contracts as annuity contracts under the internal revenue code neither you nor the beneficiary may exercise rights that would have that effect selection and change of beneficiary you select your beneficiary in your application you may change your beneficiary at any time by sending us written notice on our required form

is the person who receives annuity payments during the income phase and on whose life these payments are based in your contract the annuity options refer to the annuitant as the payee if you name someone other than yourself as annuitant and the annuitant dies before the income phase you become the annuitant in a nonqualified contract if you name someone other than yourself as annuitant you may also select a coannuitant who will become the new annuitant if the original annuitant dies before the income phase if both the annuitant and coannuitant die before the income phase you become the annuitant if you have named both an annuitant and a coannuitant you may designate one of them to become the sole annuitant as of the annuity commencement date if both are living at that time if you have not made that designation on the th day before the annuity commencement date and both the annuitant and the coannuitant are still living the coannuitant will become the annuitant when an annuity

following the year the annuitant retires if later than the year the annuitant reaches age   annuity options we offer the following annuity options for payments during the income phase each annuity option may be selected for a variable annuity a fixed annuity or a combination of both we may also agree to other settlement options at our discretion      annuity option a  life annuity we provide monthly payments during the lifetime of the annuitant annuity payments stop when the annuitant dies there is no provision for continuation of any payments to a beneficiary      annuity option b  life annuity with    or  monthly payments certain we make monthly payments during the lifetime of the annuitant in addition we guarantee that the beneficiary will receive monthly payments for the remainder of the period certain if the annuitant dies during that period the election of a longer period results in smaller monthly payments if no beneficiary is designated we pay the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum to the annuitants estate the beneficiary may also elect to receive the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum the discount rate for a variable annuity will be the assumed interest rate in effect the discount rate for a fixed annuity will be based on the interest rate we used to determine the amount of each payment      annuity option c  joint and survivor annuity we make monthly payments during the lifetime of the annuitant and another person you designate and during the lifetime of the survivor of the two we stop making payments when the survivor dies there is no provision for continuance of any payments to a beneficiary      annuity option d  monthly payments for a specified period certain we make monthly payments for a specified period of time from  to  years as you elect if payments under this option are paid on a variable annuity basis the annuitant may elect to receive at any time some or all of the discounted value of the

income payments are made as described under annuity option b the election of this annuity option may result in the imposition of a penalty tax the     and year periods certain are not available if your account has been issued within the past  years selection of annuity option you select one or more of the annuity options which you may change from time to time during the accumulation phase as long as we receive your selection or change in writing at least  days before the annuity commencement date if we have not received your written selection on the th day before the annuity commencement date you will receive annuity option b for a life annuity with  monthly payments certain you may specify the proportion of your adjusted account value you wish to provide a variable annuity or a fixed annuity under a variable annuity the dollar amount of payments will vary while under a fixed annuity the dollar amount of payments will remain the same if you do not specify a variable annuity or a fixed annuity your adjusted account value will be divided between variable annuities and fixed annuities in the same proportions as your account value was divided between the variable and fixed accounts on the annuity commencement date you may allocate your adjusted account value applied to a variable annuity among the subaccounts or we will use your existing allocations there may be additional limitations on the options you may elect under your particular retirement plan or applicable law remember that the annuity options may not be changed once annuity payments begin amount of annuity payments      adjusted account value the adjusted account value is the amount we apply to provide a variable annuity andor a fixed annuity we calculate adjusted account value by taking your account value on the business day just before the annuity commencement date and making the following adjustments  we deduct a proportional amount of the account fee based on the fraction of the current account year that has elapsed      if applicable we apply the market value adjustment to your account value in the fixed account which may result in a deduction an addition or no change      we deduct any applicable premium tax or similar tax if not previously deducted      variable annuity payments on the annuity commencement date we will exchange your accounts variable annuity units for annuitization units which have annual insurance charges of  of your average daily net assets  if your initial purchase payment was  or more variable annuity payments may vary each month we determine the dollar amount of the first payment using the portion of your adjusted account value applied to a variable annuity and the annuity payment rates in your contract which are based on an assumed interest rate of  per year compounded annually see annuity payment rates to calculate the remaining payments we convert the amount of the first payment into annuity units for each subaccount we determine the number of those annuity units by dividing the portion of the first payment attributable to the subaccount by the annuity unit value of that subaccount for the valuation period ending just before the annuity commencement date this number of annuity units for each subaccount will remain constant unless the annuitant requests an exchange of annuity units however the dollar amount of the next variable annuity payment  which is the sum of the number of annuity units for each subaccount times its annuity unit value for the valuation period ending just before the date of the payment  will increase decrease or remain the same depending on the net investment return of the subaccounts if the net investment return of the subaccounts selected is the same as the assumed interest rate of  compounded annually the payments will remain level if the net investment return exceeds the assumed interest rate payments will increase and conversely if it is less than the assumed interest rate payments will decrease please refer to the statement of additional information for more information about calculating variable annuity units and variable annuity payments including examples of these calculations      fixed annuity payments fixed annuity payments are the same each month we determine the dollar amount of each fixed annuity payment using the fixed portion of your adjusted account value and the applicable annuity payment rates these will be either  the rates in your contract which are based on a minimum guaranteed interest rate of  per year compounded annually or  new rates we have published and are using on the annuity commencement date if they are more favorable see annuity payment rates      minimum payments if your adjusted account value is less than  or the first annuity payment for any annuity option is less than  we will pay the adjusted account value to the annuitant in one payment exchange of variable annuity units during the income phase the annuitant may exchange annuity units in one subaccount for annuity units in another subaccount up to  times each account year to make an exchange the annuitant sends us at our annuity mailing address a written request stating the number of annuity units in the subaccount he or she wishes to exchange and the new subaccount for which annuity units are requested the number of new annuity units will be calculated so the dollar amount of an annuity payment on the date of the exchange would not be affected to calculate this number we use annuity unit values for the valuation period during which we receive the exchange request before exchanging annuity units in one subaccount for those in another the annuitant should carefully review the fund prospectuses for the investment objectives and risk disclosure of the funds in which the subaccounts invest during the income phase we permit only exchanges among subaccounts no exchanges to or from a fixed annuity are permitted account fee during the income phase we deduct the annual account fee of  in equal amounts from each variable annuity payment we do not deduct the annual account fee from fixed annuity payments annuity payment rates the contracts contain annuity payment rates for each annuity option described in this prospectus the rates show for each  applied the dollar amount of a the first monthly variable annuity payment based on the assumed interest rate specified in the applicable contract  per year compounded annually and b the monthly fixed annuity payment when this payment is based on the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in the contract at least  per year compounded annually we may change these rates under group contracts for accounts established after the effective date of such change see other contract provisions  modification the annuity payment rates may vary according to the annuity option elected and the adjusted age of the annuitant the contracts also describe the method of determining the adjusted age of the annuitant the mortality table used in determining the annuity payment rates for annuity options a b and c is the annuity  table annuity options as method of payment for death benefit you or your beneficiary may also select one or more annuity options to be used in the event of the covered persons death before the income phase as described under the death benefit section of

subaccount credited to the participant account by the net asset value of one fund share as of the same date on or after the annuity commencement date the number of fund shares as to which such instructions may be given by a payee is determined by dividing the reserve held by the company in the subaccount with respect to the particular payee by the net asset value of a fund share as of the same date after the annuity commencement date the number of fund shares as to which a payee is entitled to give voting instructions will generally decrease due to the decrease in the reserve periodic

revocation we will refund your purchase payments this right of revocation with respect to an ira is in addition to the return privilege set forth in the preceding paragraph we allow a participant establishing an ira a ten day freelook notwithstanding the provisions of the internal revenue code tax considerations this section provides general information on the federal income tax consequences of ownership of a contract based upon our understanding of current federal tax laws actual federal tax consequences will vary depending on among other things the type of retirement plan under which your contract is issued also legislation altering the current tax treatment of annuity contracts could be enacted in the future and could apply retroactively to contracts that were purchased before the date of enactment we make no attempt to consider any applicable federal estate federal gift state or other tax laws we also make no guarantee regarding the federal state or local tax status of any contract or any transaction involving any contract you should consult a qualified tax professional for advice before purchasing a contract or executing any other transaction such as a rollover distribution withdrawal or payment involving a contract us federal income tax considerations the following discussion applies only to those contracts issued in the united states for a discussion of tax considerations effecting contracts issued in puerto rico see puerto rico tax considerations below      deductibility of purchase payments for federal income tax purposes purchase payments made under nonqualified contracts are not deductible under certain circumstances purchase payments made under qualified contracts may be excludible or deductible from taxable income any such amounts will also be excluded from the investment in the contract for purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distributions from a qualified contract      predistribution taxation of contracts generally an increase in the value of a contract will not give rise to a current income tax liability to the owner of a contract or to any payee under the contract until a distribution is received from the contract however certain assignments or pledges of a contract or loans under a contract will be treated as distributions to the owner of the contract and will accelerate the taxability of any increases in the value of a contract also corporate or other nonnatural person owners of a nonqualified contract will generally incur a current tax liability on account value increases there are certain exceptions to this current taxation rule including i any contract that is an immediate annuity which the internal revenue code the code defines as a single premium contract with an annuity commencement date within one year of the date of purchase which provides for a series of substantially equal periodic payments to be made not less frequently than annually during the annuity period and ii any contract that the nonnatural person holds as agent for a natural person such as where a bank or other entity holds a contract as trustee under a trust agreement you should note that a qualified retirement plan generally provides tax deferral regardless of whether the plan invests in an annuity contract for that reason no decision to purchase a qualified contract should be based on the assumption that the purchase of a qualified contract is necessary to obtain tax deferral under a qualified plan        distributions and withdrawals from nonqualified contracts the account value of a nonqualified contract will generally include both i an amount attributable to purchase payments the return of which will not be taxable and ii an amount attributable to investment earnings the receipt of which will be taxable at ordinary income rates the relative portions of any particular distribution that derive from nontaxable purchase payments and taxable investment earnings depend upon the nature and the timing of that distribution any withdrawal of less than your entire account value under a nonqualified contract before the annuity commencement date must be treated as a receipt of investment earnings you may not treat such withdrawals as a nontaxable return of purchase payments unless you have first withdrawn the entire amount of the account value that is attributable to investment earnings for purposes of determining whether an owner has withdrawn the entire amount of the investment earnings under a nonqualified contract the code provides that all nonqualified deferred annuity contracts issued by the same company to the same owner during any one calendar year must be treated as one annuity contract a payee who receives annuity payments under a nonqualified contract after the annuity commencement date will generally be able to treat a portion of each payment as a nontaxable return of purchase payments and to treat only the remainder of each such payment as taxable investment earnings until the purchase payments have been fully recovered in this manner the nontaxable portion of each payment will be determined by the ratio of i the total amount of the purchase payments made under the contract to ii the payees expected return under the contract once the payee has received nontaxable payments in an amount equal to total purchase payments no further exclusion is allowed and all future distributions will constitute fully taxable ordinary income if payments are terminated upon the death of the annuitant or other payee before the purchase payments have been fully recovered the unrecovered purchase payments may be deducted on the final return of the annuitant or other payee a penalty tax of  may also apply to taxable cash withdrawals including lumpsum payments from nonqualified contracts this penalty will generally not apply to distributions made after age   to distributions pursuant to the death or disability of the distributions that are a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a lifetime annuity or to distributions under an immediate annuity as defined above death benefits paid upon the death of a contract owner are not life insurance benefits and will generally be includable in the income of the recipient to the extent they represent investment earnings under the contract for this purpose the amount of the investment in the contract is not affected by the owners or annuitants death ie the investment in the contract must still be determined by reference to the total purchase payments excluding amounts that were deductible by or excluded from the gross income of the owner of a contract less any purchase payments that were amounts previously received which were not includable in income special mandatory distribution rules also apply after the death of the owner when the beneficiary is not the surviving spouse of the owner if death benefits are distributed in a lump sum the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as upon a full surrender of the contract if death benefits are distributed under an annuity option the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as annuity payments as described above      distributions and withdrawals from qualified contracts in most cases all of the distributions you receive from a qualified contract will constitute fully taxable ordinary income also a  penalty tax will apply to distributions prior to age   except in certain circumstances if you receive an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified contract other than from a contract issued for use with an individual retirement account and roll over some or all of that distribution to another eligible plan the portion of such distribution that is rolled over will not be includible in your income however any eligible rollover distribution will be subject to  mandatory withholding as described below because the amount of the cash paid to you as an eligible rollover distribution will be reduced by this withholding you will not be able to roll over the entire account balance under your contract unless you use other funds equal to the tax withholding to complete the rollover an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution to you of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of your account other than  a distribution which is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a lifetime annuity or for a specified period of ten years or more      any required minimum distribution or      any hardship distribution only you or your spouse may elect to roll over a distribution to an eligible retirement plan      withholding in the case of an eligible rollover distribution as defined above from a qualified contract other than from a contract issued for use with an individual retirement account we or the plan administrator must withhold and remit to the us government  of the distribution unless the participant or payee elects to make a direct rollover of the distribution to another qualified retirement plan that is eligible to receive the rollover however only you or your spouse may elect a direct rollover in the case of a distribution from i a nonqualified contract ii a qualified contract issued for use with an individual retirement account or iii a qualified contract where the distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution we will withhold and remit to the us government a part of the taxable portion of each distribution unless prior to the distribution the participant or payee provides us his or her taxpayer identification number and instructs us in the manner prescribed not to withhold the participant or payee may credit against his or her federal income tax liability for the year of distribution any amounts that we or the plan administrator withhold      investment diversification and control the treasury department has issued regulations that prescribe investment diversification requirements for mutual fund series underlying nonqualified variable contracts all nonqualified contracts must comply with these regulations to qualify as annuities for federal income tax purposes the owner of a nonqualified contract that does not meet these guidelines will be subject to current taxation on annual increases in value of the contract we believe that each fund available as an investment option under the contract complies with these regulations the preamble to the  investment diversification regulations stated that the internal revenue service may promulgate guidelines under which an owners excessive control over investments underlying the contract will preclude the contract from qualifying as an annuity for federal tax purposes we cannot predict whether such guidelines if and when they may be promulgated will be retroactive we reserve the right to modify the contract andor the variable account to the extent necessary to comply with any such guidelines but cannot assure that such modifications would satisfy any retroactive guidelines      tax treatment of the company and the variable account as a life insurance company under the code we will record and report operations of the variable account separately from other operations the variable account will not however constitute a regulated investment company or any other type of taxable entity distinct from our other operations under present law we will not incur tax on the income of the variable account consisting primarily of interest dividends and net capital gains if we use this income to increase reserves under contracts participating in the variable account      qualified retirement plans you may use qualified contracts with several types of qualified retirement plans because tax consequences will vary with the type of qualified retirement plan and the plans specific terms and conditions we provide below only brief general descriptions of the consequences that follow from using qualified contracts in connection with various types of qualified retirement plans we stress that the rights of any person to any benefits under these plans may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves regardless of the terms of the qualified contracts that you are using these terms and conditions may include restrictions on among other things ownership transferability assignability contributions and distributions      pension and profitsharing plans sections a k and a of the code permit business employers and certain associations to establish various types of retirement plans for employees the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of  eliminated most differences between qualified retirement plans of corporations and those of selfemployed individuals selfemployed persons as a general rule may therefore use qualified contracts as a funding vehicle for their retirement plans      taxsheltered annuities section b of the code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of charitable educational and scientific organizations specified in section c of the code to purchase annuity contracts and subject to certain limitations exclude the amount of purchase payments from gross income for tax purposes the code imposes restrictions on cash withdrawals from section b annuities if the contracts are to receive taxdeferred treatment cash withdrawals of amounts attributable to salary reduction contributions other than withdrawals of accumulation account value as of december   may be made only when the participant attains age   separates from service with the employer dies or becomes disabled within the meaning of section m of the code these restrictions apply to i any post salary reduction contributions ii any growth or interest on post salary reduction contributions iii any growth or interest on pre salary reduction contributions that occurs on or after january   and iv any pre salary reduction contributions since we do not maintain records that separately account for such contributions  it is permissible however to withdraw post salary reduction contributions but not the earnings attributable to such contributions in cases of financial hardship while the internal revenue service has not issued specific rules defining financial hardship we expect that to qualify for a hardship distribution the participant must have an immediate and heavy bona fide financial need and lack other resources reasonably available to satisfy the need hardship withdrawals as well as certain other premature withdrawals will be subject to a  tax penalty in addition to any withdrawal charge applicable under the contracts under certain circumstances the  tax penalty will not apply if the withdrawal is for medical expenses section b annuities like iras are subject to required minimum distributions under the code section b annuities are unique however in that any account balance accruing before january   the pre balance needs to comply with only the minimum distribution incidental benefit mdib rule and not also with the minimum distribution rules set forth in section a of the code this special treatment for any pre balance is however conditioned upon the issuer identifying the pre balance and maintaining accurate records of changes to the balance since we do not maintain such records your pre balance if any will not be eligible for special distribution treatment under the terms of a particular section b plan the participant may be entitled to transfer all or a portion of the account value to one or more alternative funding options participants should consult the documents governing their plan and the person who administers the plan for information as to such investment alternatives      individual retirement accounts sections  and  of the code permit eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program including simplified employee pension plans employerassociation of employees established individual retirement account trusts and simple retirement accounts such iras are subject to limitations on contribution levels the persons who may be eligible and on the time when distributions may commence in addition certain distributions from some other types of retirement plans may be placed in an ira on a taxdeferred basis if we sell contracts for use with iras the internal revenue service or other agency may impose supplementary information requirements we will provide purchasers of the contracts for such purposes with any necessary information you will have the right to revoke the contract under certain circumstances as described in the section of this prospectus entitled right to return      roth iras section a of the code permits an individual to contribute to an individual retirement program called a roth ira unlike contributions to a traditional ira under section  of the code contributions to a roth ira are not taxdeductible provided certain conditions are satisfied distributions are generally taxfree like traditional iras roth iras are subject to limitations on contribution amounts and the timing of distributions if an individual converts a traditional ira into a roth ira the full amount of the ira is included in taxable income the internal revenue service and other agencies may impose special information requirements with respect to roth iras we will provide the necessary information for contracts issued in connection with roth iras      status of optional death benefit riders under the code iras may not invest in life insurance policies regulations issued by the treasury department provide that death benefits under iras do not violate this rule provided that the death benefit is no more than the greater of the total premiums paid net of prior withdrawals or the cash value of the ira in certain circumstances the death benefit payable under the contracts optional death benefit riders may exceed both the total premiums paid net of prior withdrawals and the cash value of the contract we have filed the contract and the eeb plus eeb plus mav and eeb plus  rollup optional death benefit riders new riders with the internal revenue service irs requesting a ruling approving the use of the contract with the new riders as an ira we have already received a favorable determination letter with respect to the following optional death benefit riders eeb mav  rollup eeb and mav eeb and  rollup mav and  rollup and eeb and mav and  rollup old riders although we regard the new riders as an investment protection feature that should not result in adverse tax treatment we give no assurance that the irs will approve the use of the contract with the new riders in iras denial of our request by the irs could result in taxation of the entire balance of your ira and penalty taxes you should consult a qualified tax adviser before adding any of the new riders to your contract if it is an ira puerto rico tax considerations the contract offered by this prospectus is considered an annuity contract under section  of the puerto rico internal revenue code of  as amended the  code under the current provisions of the  code no income tax is payable on increases in value of accumulation shares of annuity units credited to a variable annuity contract until payments are made to the annuitant or other payee under such contract when payments are made from your contract in the form of an annuity the annuitant or other payee will be required to include as gross income the lesser of the amount received during the taxable year or the portion of the amount received equal to  of the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the annuity the amount if any in excess of the included amount is excluded from gross income as a return of premium after an amount equal to the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the annuity has been excluded from gross income all of the subsequent annuity payments are considered to be taxable income when a payment under a contract is made in a lump sum the amount of the payment would be included in the gross income of the annuitant or other payee to the extent it exceeds the annuitants aggregate premiums or other consideration paid the provisions of the  code with respect to qualified retirement plans described in this prospectus vary significantly from those under the internal revenue code although we currently offer the contract in puerto rico in connection with

reports to shareholders sales literature and advertisements containing performance information relating to the subaccounts this information may include standardized and nonstandardized average annual total return cumulative growth rate and compound growth rate we may also advertise yield and effective yield for some variable options average annual total return measures the net income of the subaccount and any realized or unrealized gains or losses of the fund in which it invests over the period stated average annual total return figures are annualized and represent the average annual percentage change in the value of an investment in a subaccount over that period standardized average annual total return information covers the period after the variable account was established or if shorter the life of the series nonstandardized average annual total return covers the life of each fund which may predate the variable account cumulative growth rate represents the cumulative change in the value of an investment in the subaccount for the period stated and is arrived at by calculating the change in the accumulation unit value of a subaccount between the first and the last day of the period being measured the difference is expressed as a percentage of the accumulation unit value at the beginning of the base period compound growth rate is an annualized measure calculated by applying a formula that determines the level of return which if earned over the entire period would produce the cumulative return average annual total return figures assume an initial purchase payment of  and reflect all applicable withdrawal and contract charges the cumulative growth rate and compound growth rate figures that we advertise do not reflect withdrawal charges or the account fee although such figures do reflect all recurring charges results calculated without withdrawal andor certain contract charges will be higher we may also use other types of rates of return that do not reflect withdrawal and contract charges the performance figures used by the variable account are based on the actual historical performance of the underlying funds for the specified periods and the figures are not intended to indicate future performance for periods before the date the contracts became available we calculate the performance information for the subaccount on a hypothetical basis to do this we reflect deductions of the current contract fees and charges from the historical performance of the corresponding funds yield is a measure of the net dividend and interest income earned over a specific one month or day period day period for the available money market subaccount expressed as a percentage of the value of the subaccounts accumulation units yield is an annualized figure which means that we assume that the subaccount generates the same level of net income over a oneyear period and compound that income on a semiannual basis we calculate the effective yield for the money market subaccount similarly but include the increase due to assumed compounding the money market subaccounts effective yield will be slightly higher than its yield as a result of its compounding

the market value adjustment part  variable account the market value adjustment does not apply to the variable account withdrawal charge calculation full withdrawal assume a purchase payment of  is made on the contract date no additional purchase payments are made and there are no partial withdrawals the table below presents three examples of the withdrawal charge resulting from a full withdrawal of your account based on hypothetical account values                   hypothetical free subject to withdrawal withdrawal   account account withdrawal withdrawal charge charge   year value amount charge percentage amount               a                 b                 c                                 a the free withdrawal amount in any year is equal to  of all of the purchase payments you have made in account year  the free withdrawal amount is  which equals  of the purchase payment of  on a full withdrawal of  the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is  which equals the account value of  minus the free withdrawal amount of      b in account year  the free withdrawal amount is  which equals  of the purchase payment of  the account value minus the free withdrawal amount is  minus  which equals  however the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is capped at the amount of your unliquidated purchase payments therefore the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is  which is the amount of your unliquidated purchase payments     c in account year  you have passed your fourth account anniversary so no withdrawal charges apply to any withdrawals you make partial withdrawal assume a single purchase payment of  is made on the contract date no additional purchase payments are made no partial withdrawals have been taken prior to the fourth account year and there is a series of  partial withdrawals made during the fourth account year of    and                                      remaining remaining     hypothetical free   amount of     free hypothetical     account withdrawal   withdrawal     withdrawal account     value amount amount subject to withdrawal withdrawal amount value   account before before of withdrawal charge charge after after   year withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal charge percentage amount withdrawal withdrawal                                                                                                a                    b

the partial withdrawal amount of  is less than the free withdrawal amount so there is no withdrawal charge     b ince a partial withdrawal of  was taken the remaining free withdrawal amount in account year  is      therefore  of the  withdrawal is not subject to a withdrawal charge and  is subject to a withdrawal charge of the  withdrawn to date  has been from the free withdrawal amount and  has been from purchase payments therefore the amount of unliquidated purchase payments is      c since  of the two prior account year  partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount the remaining free withdrawal amount in account year  is      therefore the entire  withdrawal is subject to a withdrawal charge of the  withdrawn to date  has been from the free withdrawal amount and  has been from purchase payments therefore the amount of unliquidated purchase payments is      d since  of the three prior account year  partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount the remaining free withdrawal amount in account year  is      the amount of unliquidated purchase payments remaining before this withdrawal is  therefore  of the  withdrawal is taken from purchase payments and is subject to a withdrawal charge and  of the withdrawal is taken from earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge of the  withdrawn to date  has been from the free withdrawal amount  has been from purchase payments and  has been from earnings the amount of unliquidated purchase payments is now equal to  note that if the  remaining balance was withdrawn it would all be from earnings and not subject to a withdrawal charge the total account year  withdrawal charges would then be  which is the same amount that was assessed for a full liquidation in account year  in the example on the previous page part   fixed account  examples of the market value adjustment mva the mva factor is   i    j  b  n  these examples assume the following  the guarantee amount was allocated to a year guarantee period with a guaranteed interest rate of  or       the date of surrender is  years from the expiration date n        the value of the guarantee amount on the date of surrender is       the interest earned in the current account year is       no transfers or partial withdrawals affecting this guarantee amount have been made      withdrawal charges if any are calculated in the same manner as shown in the examples in part  example of a negative mva assume that on the date of surrender the current rate j is  or  and the b factor is zero the  mva  factor      i    j  b  n                                  the value of the guarantee amount less interest credited to the guarantee amount in the current account year is multiplied by the mva factor to determine the mva                 x     represents the mva that will be deducted from the value of the guarantee amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge for a partial withdrawal of  from this guarantee amount the mva would be    x     represents the mva that will be deducted from the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge example of a positive mva assume that on the date of surrender the current rate j is  or  and the b factor is zero the  mva  factor      i    j  b  n                                   the value of the guarantee amount less interested credit to the guarantee amount in the current account year is multiplied by the mva factor to determine the mva                 x     represents the mva that would be added to the value of the guarantee amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge for a partial withdrawal of  from this guarantee amount the mva would be    x     represents the mva that would be added to the value of the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge   appendix c calculation of basic death benefit example  assume a purchase payment of  is made on the contract date and an additional purchase payment of  is made one year later assume that all of the money is invested in the subaccounts that no withdrawals are made and that the account value on the death benefit date is  the calculation of the death benefit to be paid is as follows the basic death benefit is the greatest of         account value        cash surrender value        purchase payments   the basic death benefit would therefore be   example  assume a purchase payment of  is made on the contract date and an additional purchase payment of  is made one year later assume that all of the money is invested

investment performance of that subaccount we determine that value once on each day that the new york stock exchange is open for trading at the close of trading which is currently  pm eastern time the close of trading is determined by the new york stock exchange we also may determine the value of variable accumulation units of a subaccount on days the exchange is closed if there is enough trading in securities held by that subaccount to materially affect the value of the variable accumulation units each day we make a valuation is called a business day the period that begins at the time variable accumulation units are valued on a business day and ends at that time on the next business day is called a valuation period on days other than business days the value of a variable accumulation unit does not change to measure these values we use a factor  which we call the net investment factor  which represents the net return on the subaccounts assets at the end of any valuation period the value of a variable accumulation unit for a subaccount is equal to the value of that subaccounts variable accumulation units at the end of the previous valuation period multiplied by the net investment factor we calculate the net investment factor by dividing  the net asset value of a fund share held in the subaccount at the end of that valuation period plus the per share amount of any dividend or capital gains distribution made by that fund during the valuation period by  the net asset value per share of the fund share at the end of the previous valuation period then for each day in the valuation period we deduct a factor representing the assetbased insurance charges the mortality and expense risk charges and the administrative expense charge plus any applicable charge for optional death benefit riders see contract charges for a hypothetical example of how we calculate the value of a variable accumulation unit see the statement of additional information      crediting and canceling variable accumulation units when we receive an allocation to a subaccount either from a net purchase payment or a transfer of account value we credit that amount to your account in variable accumulation units similarly we cancel variable accumulation units when you transfer or withdraw amounts from a subaccount or when we deduct certain charges under the contract we determine the number of units credited or canceled by dividing the dollar amount by the variable accumulation unit value for that subaccount at the end of the valuation period during which the transaction or charge is effective fixed account value your fixed account value is the sum of all amounts allocated to guarantee periods either from net purchase payments transfers or renewals plus interest credited on those amounts and minus withdrawals transfers out of guarantee periods and any deductions for charges under the contract taken from your fixed account value a guarantee period begins the day we apply your allocation and ends when all calendar years or months if the guarantee period is less than one year in the guarantee period measured from the end of the calendar month in which the amount was allocated to the guarantee period have elapsed the last day of the guarantee period is its renewal date each additional purchase payment transfer or renewal credited to your fixed account value will result in a new guarantee period with its own renewal date amounts allocated at different times to guarantee periods of the same duration may have different renewal dates      crediting interest we credit interest on amounts allocated to a guarantee period at the applicable guaranteed interest rate for the duration of the guarantee period during the guarantee period we credit interest daily at a rate that yields the guaranteed interest rate on an annual effective basis      guarantee amounts each separate allocation you make to a guarantee period together with interest credited thereon is called a guarantee amount each guarantee amount is treated separately for purposes of determining the market value adjustment we may restrict a guarantee period that will extend beyond your maximum annuity commencement date renewals into a guarantee period that will extend beyond your maximum annuity commencement date will result in an application of a market value adjustment upon annuitization or withdrawals each new allocation to a guarantee period must be at least       renewals we will notify you in writing between  and  days before the renewal date for any guarantee amount if you would like to change your fixed account option we must receive from you prior to the renewal date  written notice electing a different guarantee period from among those we then offer or      written instructions to transfer the guarantee amount to one or more subaccounts in accordance with the transfer privilege provisions of the contract see transfer privilege if we receive no instructions from you prior to the renewal date we will automatically renew your fixed account allocation into a new guarantee period of the same duration as the last guarantee period if we are no longer offering a guarantee period of the same duration we will automatically transfer your fixed account allocation into the money market subaccount a guarantee amount will not renew into a guarantee period that will extend beyond your maximum annuity commencement date in that case unless you notify us otherwise we will automatically renew your guarantee amount into the money market subaccount      early withdrawals if you withdraw transfer or annuitize an allocation to a guarantee period  days prior to the renewal date we will apply a market value adjustment to the transaction this could result in an increase or a decrease of your account value depending on interest rates at the time you bear the risk that you will receive less than your principal if the market value adjustment applies transfer privilege      permitted transfers during the accumulation phase you may transfer all or part of your account value to one or more subaccounts or guarantee periods then available subject to the following restrictions o you may not make more than  transfers in any account year     o the amount transferred from a subaccount must be at least  unless you are transferring your entire balance in that subaccount     o your account value remaining in a subaccount must be at least      o the amount transferred from a guarantee period must be the entire guarantee amount except for transfers of interest credited during the current account year     o at least  days must elapse between transfers to and from guarantee periods     o transfers to or from subaccounts are subject to terms and conditions that may be imposed by the funds     o the total number of subaccounts and guarantee periods within an account may not exceed  over the lifetime of the contract and     o we impose additional restrictions on market timers which are further described below these restrictions do not apply to transfers made under any approved optional program at our discretion we may waive some or all of these restrictions there is usually no charge imposed on transfers however we reserve the right to impose a transfer charge of  for each transfer transfers out of a guarantee period more than  days before the renewal date or any time after the renewal date or any time after the renewal date will be subject to the market value adjustment described below under current law there is no tax liability for transfers      requests for transfers you may request transfers in writing or by telephone if the request is by telephone it must be made before the earlier of a  pm eastern time on a business day or b the close of the new york stock exchange on days that the stock exchange closes before  pm otherwise your transfer request will be effective on the next business day the telephone transfer privilege is available automatically and does not require your written election we will require personal identifying information to process a request for a transfer made by telephone we will not be liable for following instructions communicated by telephone that we reasonably believe are genuine your transfer request will be effective as of the close of the business day if we receive your transfer request before the earlier of a  pm eastern time on a business day or b the close of the new york stock exchange on days that the stock exchange closes before  pm otherwise your transfer request will be effective on the next business day      market timers the contracts are not designed for professional market timing organizations or other entities using programmed and frequent transfers if you wish to employ such strategies you should not purchase a contract accordingly transfers may be subject to restrictions if exercised by a market timing firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transfer transactions on behalf of multiple participants in imposing such restrictions we may among other things not accept  the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one participant or  the transfer instructions of individual participants who have executed preauthorized transfer forms that are submitted at the same time by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one participant we will not impose these restrictions unless our actions are reasonably intended to prevent the use of such transfers in a manner that will disadvantage or potentially impair the contract rights of other participants in addition the series fund has reserved the right to temporarily or permanently refuse exchange requests from the variable account if in the fund managers judgment a fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective and policies or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected in particular a pattern of exchanges that coincide with a market timing strategy may be disruptive to a fund and therefore may be refused accordingly the variable account may not be in a position to effectuate transfers and may refuse transfer requests without prior notice we also reserve the right for similar reasons to refuse or delay exchange requests involving transfers to or from the fixed account waivers reduced charges special guaranteed interest rates we may reduce or waive the withdrawal charge mortality and expense risk charges the administrative service fee or the annual account fee credit additional amounts grant special guaranteed interest rates in certain situations or offer other options or benefits these situations may include sales of contracts  where selling andor maintenance costs associated with the contracts are reduced such as the sale of several contracts to the same participant sales of large contracts and certain group sales and  to officers directors and employees of the company or its affiliates registered representatives and employees of brokerdealers with a current selling agreement with the company and affiliates of such representatives and brokerdealers employees of affiliated asset management firms and persons who have retired from such positions eligible employees and immediate family members of eligible employees eligible employees and their immediate family members may also purchase a contract without regard to minimum purchase payment requirements for other situations in which withdrawal charges may be waived see withdrawals withdrawal charge and market value adjustment optional programs      dollarcost averaging dollarcost averaging allows you to invest gradually over time in up to  subaccounts you may select a dollarcost averaging program at no extra charge by allocating a minimum of  to a designated subaccount or to a guarantee period we make available in connection with the program amounts allocated to the fixed account under the program will earn interest at a rate declared by the company for the guarantee period you select previously applied amounts may not be transferred to a guarantee period made available in connection with this program at regular time intervals we will transfer the same amount automatically to one or more subaccounts that you choose up to a maximum of  subaccounts the program continues until your account value allocated to the program is depleted or you elect to stop the program the final amount transferred from the fixed account will include all interest earned no market value adjustment either positive or negative will apply to amounts automatically transferred from the fixed account under the dollarcost averaging program however if you discontinue or alter the program prior to completion amounts remaining in the fixed account will be transferred to the money market fund investment option under the contract unless you instruct us otherwise and the market value adjustment will be applied any new allocation of a purchase payment to the program will be treated as commencing a new dollarcost averaging program and is subject to the  minimum the main objective of a dollarcost averaging program is to minimize the impact of shortterm price fluctuations on account value in general since you transfer the same dollar amount to the variable investment options at set intervals dollarcost averaging allows you to purchase more variable accumulation units and indirectly more fund shares when prices are low and fewer variable accumulation units and indirectly fewer fund shares when prices are high therefore you may achieve a lower average cost per variable accumulation unit over the long term a dollarcost averaging program allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations however it is important to understand that a dollarcost averaging program does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market we do not allow transfers into any of the guarantee periods      asset allocation one or more asset allocation programs may be available in connection with the contract at no extra charge asset allocation is the process of investing in different asset classes  such as equity funds fixed income funds and money market funds  depending on your personal investment goals tolerance for risk and investment time horizon by spreading your money among a variety of asset classes you may be able to reduce the risk and volatility of investing although there are no guarantees and asset allocation does not insure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market currently you may select one of the available asset allocation models each of which represents a combination of subaccounts with a different level of risk these models as well as the terms and conditions of the asset allocation program are fully described in a separate brochure we may add or delete programs in the future if you elect an asset allocation program we will automatically allocate your purchase payments among the subaccounts represented in the model you choose by electing an asset allocation program you thereby authorize us to automatically reallocate your investment options as determined by the terms of the asset allocation program to reflect the current composition of the model you have selected without further instruction until we receive notification that you wish to terminate the program or choose a different model      systematic withdrawal program if you have an account value of  or more you may select our systematic withdrawal program under this program you determine the amount and frequency of regular withdrawals you would like to receive from your fixed account value andor variable account value and we will effect them automatically the withdrawals under this program may be subject to surrender charges or a market value adjustment they may also be included as income and subject to a  federal tax penalty you should consult your tax adviser before choosing this option you may change or stop this program at any time by written notice to us      portfolio rebalancing program under the portfolio rebalancing program we transfer funds among all subaccounts to maintain the percentage allocation you have selected among these subaccounts at your election we will make these transfers on a quarterly semiannual or annual basis portfolio rebalancing does not permit transfers to or from any guarantee period      principal returns program under the principal returns program we divide your purchase payments between the fixed account and the variable account for the fixed account portion you choose a guarantee period from among those we offer we then allocate to that guarantee period the portion of your purchase payment necessary so that at the end of the guarantee period your fixed account allocation including interest will equal the entire amount of your original purchase payment the remainder of the original purchase payment will be invested in the subaccounts of your choice at the end of the guarantee period you will be guaranteed the amount of your original purchase payment assuming no withdrawals plus you will have the benefit if any of the investment performance of the subaccounts you have chosen withdrawals withdrawal charge and market value adjustment cash withdrawals      requesting a withdrawal at any time during the accumulation phase you may withdraw in cash all or any portion of your account value to make a withdrawal you must send us a written request at our annuity mailing address your request must specify whether you want to withdraw the entire amount of your account or if less the amount you wish to receive all withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge see withdrawal charge and withdrawals from your fixed account value also may be subject to a market value adjustment see market value adjustment withdrawals also may have adverse income tax consequences including a  penalty tax see tax considerations you should carefully consider these tax consequences before requesting a cash withdrawal      full withdrawals if you request a full withdrawal we calculate the amount we will pay you as follows we start with the total value of your account at the end of the valuation period during which we receive your withdrawal request we deduct the account fee for the account year in which the withdrawal is made we add or subtract the amount of any market value adjustment applicable to your fixed account value and finally we deduct any applicable withdrawal charge a full withdrawal results in the surrender of your contract and cancellation of all rights and privileges under your contract      partial withdrawals if you request a partial withdrawal we will pay you the actual amount specified in your request and then adjust the value of your account by deducting the amount paid adding or deducting any market value adjustment applicable to amounts withdrawn from the fixed account and deducting any applicable withdrawal charge you may specify the amount you want withdrawn from each subaccount andor guarantee amount to which your account is allocated if you do not so specify we will deduct the total amount you request pro rata based on your account value at the end of the valuation period during which we receive your request if you request a partial withdrawal that would result in your account value being reduced to an amount less than the account fee for the account year in which you make the withdrawal we will treat it as a request for a full withdrawal      time of payment we will pay you the applicable amount of any full or partial withdrawal within  days after we receive your withdrawal request except in cases where we are permitted and choose to defer payment under the investment company act of  and applicable state insurance law currently we may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the variable account only for the following periods o when the new york stock exchange is closed except weekends and holidays or when trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted     o when it is not reasonably practical to dispose of securities held by a fund or to determine the value of the net assets of a fund because an emergency exists or     o when an sec order permits us to defer payment for the protection of participants we also may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the fixed account for up to  months from the date we receive your withdrawal request we do not pay interest on the amount of any payments we defer      withdrawal restrictions for qualified plans if your contract is a qualified contract you should carefully check the terms of your retirement plan for limitations and restrictions on cash withdrawals special restrictions apply to withdrawals from contracts used for section b annuities see tax considerations  taxsheltered annuities withdrawal charge we do not deduct any sales charge from your purchase payments when they are made however we may impose a withdrawal charge known as a contingent deferred sales charge on certain amounts you withdraw we impose this charge to defray some of our expenses related to the sale of the contracts such as commissions we pay to agents the cost of sales literature and other promotional costs and transaction expenses      free withdrawal amount in each account year you may withdraw a portion of your account value  which we call the free withdrawal amount  before incurring the withdrawal charge the free withdrawal amount is equal to  of the amount of all purchase payments you have made after the fourth account anniversary any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges the free withdrawal amount that you do not use in an account year is not cumulative in other words it will not be carried forward or available for use in future account years for an example of how we calculate the free withdrawal amount see appendix b      withdrawal charge on purchase payments if you withdraw more than the free withdrawal amount in any account year we consider the excess amount to be withdrawn first from payments that you have not previously withdrawn we impose the withdrawal charge on the amount of these payments thus the maximum amount on which we will impose the withdrawal charge in any year will never be more than the total of all payments that you have not previously withdrawn the amount of your withdrawal if any that exceeds the total of the free withdrawal amount plus the aggregate amount of all payments not previously withdrawn is not subject to the withdrawal charge      order of withdrawal when you make a withdrawal we consider the free withdrawal amount to be withdrawn first we consider purchase payments that you have not already withdrawn to be withdrawn next once all purchase payments are withdrawn the balance withdrawn is considered to be earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge      calculation of withdrawal charge we calculate the amount of the withdrawal charge by multiplying the amount you withdraw by a percentage as set forth below the percentage decreases according to the number of complete account years since your contract date after your fourth account anniversary any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges number of   account years   since your withdrawal contract date charge          or more  the withdrawal charge will never be greater than  of the excess of your account value over the free withdrawal amount as defined above for a group contract we may modify the withdrawal charges and limits upon notice to the owner of the group contract however any modification will apply only to accounts established after the date of the modification for additional examples of how we calculate withdrawal charges see appendix b types of withdrawals not subject to withdrawal charge      nursing home waivers if approved by your state we will waive the withdrawal charge for a full or partial withdrawal if o at least one year has passed since we issued your contract and     o you are confined to an eligible nursing home and have been confined there for at least the preceding  days or any shorter period required by your state an eligible nursing home means a licensed hospital or licensed skilled or intermediate care nursing facility at which medical treatment is available on a daily basis and daily medical records are kept for each patient you must provide us evidence of confinement in the form we determine      minimum distributions for each qualified contract the free withdrawal amount in any account year will be the greater of the free withdrawal amount described above or any amounts required to be withdrawn to comply with the minimum distribution requirement of the internal revenue code this waiver of the withdrawal charge applies only to the portion of the required minimum distribution attributable to that qualified contract      other withdrawals we do not impose the withdrawal charge on amounts you apply to provide an annuity amounts we pay as a death benefit except under the cash surrender method or amounts you transfer among the subaccounts between the subaccounts and the fixed account or within the fixed account market value adjustment if permitted under the laws of your state we will apply a market value adjustment if you withdraw or transfer amounts from your fixed account value more than  days before the end of the applicable guarantee period for this purpose using fixed account value to provide an annuity is considered a withdrawal and the market value adjustment will apply however we will not apply the market value adjustment to automatic transfers to a subaccount from a guarantee period as part of our dollarcost averaging program we apply the market value adjustment separately to each guarantee amount in the fixed account that is to each separate allocation you have made to a guarantee period together with interest credited on that allocation however we do not apply the adjustment to the amount of interest credited during your current account year any withdrawal from a guarantee amount is attributed first to such interest a market value adjustment may decrease increase or have no effect on your account value this will depend on changes in interest rates since you made your allocation to the guarantee period and the length of time remaining in the guarantee period in general if the guaranteed interest rate we currently declare for guarantee periods equal to the balance of your guarantee period or your entire guarantee period for guarantee periods of less than one year is higher than your guaranteed interest rate the market value adjustment is likely to decrease your account value if our current guaranteed interest rate is lower the market value adjustment is likely to increase your account value we determine the amount of the market value adjustment by multiplying the amount that is subject to the adjustment by the following formula   i    j  b  n    where i is the guaranteed interest rate applicable to the guarantee amount from which you withdraw transfer or annuitize     j is the guaranteed interest rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal transfer or annuitization for guarantee periods equal to the length of time remaining in the guarantee period applicable to your guarantee amount rounded to the next higher number of complete years for guarantee periods of one year or more for any guarantee periods of less than one year j is the guaranteed interest rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal transfer or annuitization for a guarantee period of the same length as your guarantee period if at that time we do not offer the applicable guarantee period we will use an interest rate determined by straightline interpolation of the guaranteed interest rates for the guarantee periods we do offer     n is the number of complete months remaining in your guarantee period and     b is a factor that currently is  but that in the future we may increase to up to  any increase would be applicable only to participants who purchase their contracts after the date of that increase the b factor is the amount that will be used to cover market volatility ie credit risk basis risk and or liquidity costs we will apply the market value adjustment to the amount being withdrawn after deduction of any account fee if applicable but before we impose any withdrawal charge on the amount withdrawn for examples of how we calculate the market value adjustment see appendix b contract charges account fee during the accumulation phase of your contract we will deduct from your account an annual account fee of  to help cover the administrative expenses we incur related to the issuance of contracts and the maintenance of accounts we deduct the account fee on each account anniversary we deduct the account fee pro rata from each subaccount and each guarantee period based on the allocation of your account value on your account anniversary we will not charge the account fee if  your account has been allocated only to the fixed account during the applicable account year or      your account value is  or more on your account anniversary if you make a full withdrawal of your account we will deduct the full amount of the account fee at the time of the withdrawal in addition on the annuity commencement date we will deduct a pro rata portion of the account fee to reflect the time elapsed between the last account anniversary and the day before the annuity commencement date after the annuity commencement date we will deduct an annual account fee of  in the aggregate in equal amounts from each variable annuity payment we make during the year we do not deduct any account fee from fixed annuity payments administrative expense charge we deduct an administrative expense charge from the assets of the variable account at an annual effective rate equal to  during both the accumulation phase and the income phase this charge is designed to reimburse us for expenses we incur in administering the contracts participant accounts and the variable account that are not covered by the annual account fee mortality and expense risk charge during both the accumulation phase and the income phase we deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the variable account at an effective annual rate equal to  if your initial purchase payment was less than  or  if your initial purchase payment was  or more the mortality risk we assume arises from our contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments to each annuitant regardless of how long the annuitant lives and regardless of how long all annuitants as a group live this obligation assures each annuitant that neither the longevity of fellow annuitants nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the amount of any annuity payment received under the contract the mortality risk also arises from our contractual obligation to pay a death benefit upon the death of the participant prior to the annuity commencement date the expense risk we assume is the risk that the annual account fee and the administrative expense charge we assess under the contract may be insufficient to cover the actual total administrative expenses we incur if the amount of the charge is insufficient to cover the mortality and expense risks we will bear the loss if the amount of the charge is more than sufficient to cover the risks we will make a profit on the charge we may use this profit for any proper corporate purpose including the payment of marketing and distribution expenses for the contract charges for optional death benefit riders if you elect an optional death benefit rider we will deduct during the accumulation phase a charge from the assets of

to find out if your state imposes a premium tax and the amount of any tax in order to reimburse us for the premium tax we may pay on purchase payments our policy is to deduct the amount of such taxes from the amount you apply to provide an annuity at the time of annuitization however we reserve the right to deduct the amount of any applicable tax from your account at any time including at the time you make a purchase payment or make a full or partial withdrawal we do not make any profit on the deductions we make to reimburse premium taxes fund expenses there are fees and charges deducted from each fund these fees and expenses are described in the fund prospectuses and related statements of additional information modification in the case of group contracts for group contracts we may modify

contract as the participant rather than receive the death benefit amount in that case we will not pay a death benefit but the contracts account value will be equal to your contracts death benefit amount as defined under the basic death benefit or any optional death benefit rider you have selected all contract provisions including any optional death benefit riders you have selected will continue as if your spouse had purchased the contract on the death benefit date with a deposit equal to the death benefit amount for purposes of calculating death benefits and expenses from that date forward your spouses age on the original effective date of the contract will be used upon surrender or annuitization this stepup to the spouse will not be treated as premium but will be treated as income calculating the death benefit in calculating the death benefit amount payable under option  of the basic death benefit or any of the optional death benefit riders any partial withdrawals will reduce the death benefit amount to an amount equal to the death benefit amount immediately before the withdrawal multiplied by the ratio of the account value immediately after the withdrawal to the account value immediately before the withdrawal if the death benefit is the amount payable under options  or  of the basic death benefit or under any of the optional death benefit riders your account value may be increased by the excess if any of that amount over option  of the basic death benefit any such increase will be allocated to the subaccounts in proportion to your account value in those subaccounts on the death benefit date such increase will be made only if the beneficiary elects to annuitize elects to defer annuitization or elects to continue the contract also any portion of this new account value attributed to the fixed account will be transferred to the available money market fund investment option without the application of a market value adjustment if your spouse as the named beneficiary elects to continue the contract after your death your spouse may transfer any such fixed account portion back to the fixed account and begin a new guarantee period method of paying death benefit the death benefit may be paid in a single cash payment or as an annuity either fixed variable or a combination under one or more of our annuity options we describe the annuity options in this prospectus under the income phase  annuity provisions during the accumulation phase you may elect the method of payment for the death benefit if no such election is in effect on the date of your death the beneficiary may elect either a single cash payment or an annuity if the beneficiary is your spouse the beneficiary may elect to continue the contract these elections are made by sending us a completed election form which we will provide if we do not receive the beneficiarys election within  days after we receive due proof of death we will pay the death benefit in a single cash payment if we pay the death benefit in the form of an annuity option the beneficiary becomes the annuitantpayee under the terms of that annuity option nonqualified contracts if your contract is a nonqualified contract special distribution rules apply to the payment of the death benefit the amount of the death benefit must be distributed either  as a lump sum within  years after your death or  if in the form of an annuity over a period not greater than the life or expected life of the designated beneficiary within the meaning of section s of the internal revenue code with payments beginning no later than one year after your death the person you have named as beneficiary under your contract if any will be the designated beneficiary if the named beneficiary is not living and no contingent beneficiary has been named the surviving participant if any or the estate of the deceased participant automatically becomes the designated beneficiary if the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse your spouse may continue the contract in his or her own name as participant to make this election your spouse must give us written notification within  days after we receive due proof of death the special distribution rules will then apply on the death of your spouse to understand what happens when your spouse continues the contract see spousal continuance above during the income phase if the annuitant dies the remaining value of the annuity option in place must be distributed at least as rapidly as the method of distribution under that option if the participant is not a natural person these distribution rules apply upon the death of any annuitant payments made in contravention of these special rules would adversely affect the treatment of the contracts as annuity contracts under the internal revenue code neither you nor the beneficiary may exercise rights that would have that effect selection and change of beneficiary you select your beneficiary in your application you may change your beneficiary at any time by sending us written notice on our required form unless you previously made an irrevocable beneficiary designation a new beneficiary designation is not effective until we record the change payment of death benefit payment of the death benefit in cash will be made within  days of the death benefit date except if we are permitted to defer payment in accordance with the investment company act of  if an annuity option is elected the annuity commencement date will be the first day of the second calendar month following the death benefit date and your account will remain in effect until the annuity commencement date due proof of death we accept any of the following as proof of any persons death o an original certified copy of an official death certificate

the income phase we make regular monthly annuity payments to the annuitant the income phase of your contract begins with the annuity commencement date on that date we apply your account value adjusted as described below under the annuity options you have selected and we make the first annuity payment once the income phase begins no lump sum settlement option or cash withdrawals are permitted except pursuant to annuity option d monthly payments for a specified period certain as described below under the heading annuity options and you cannot change the annuity option selected you may request a full withdrawal before the annuity commencement date which will be subject to all charges applicable on withdrawals see withdrawals withdrawal charge and market value adjustment selection of the annuitant or coannuitant you select the annuitant in your application the annuitant is the person who receives annuity payments during the income phase and on whose life these payments are based in your contract the annuity options refer to the annuitant as the payee if you name someone other than yourself as annuitant and the annuitant dies before the income phase you become the annuitant in a nonqualified contract if you name someone other than yourself as annuitant you may also select a coannuitant who will become the new annuitant if the original annuitant dies before the income phase if both the annuitant and coannuitant die before the income phase you become the annuitant if you have named both an annuitant and a coannuitant you may designate one of them to become the sole annuitant as of the annuity commencement date if both are living at that time if you have not made that designation on the th day before the annuity commencement date and both the annuitant and the coannuitant are still living the coannuitant will become the annuitant when an annuity option has been selected as the method of paying the death benefit the beneficiary is the payee of the annuity payment selection of the annuity commencement date you select the annuity commencement date in your application the following restrictions apply to the date you may select o the earliest possible annuity commencement date is the first day of the second month following your contract date     o the latest possible annuity commencement date is the first day of the month following the annuitants th

may change the annuity commencement date from time to time by sending us written notice with the following additional limitations o we must receive your notice at least  days before the current annuity commencement date     o the new annuity commencement date must be at least  days after we receive the notice there may be other restrictions on your selection of the annuity commencement date imposed by your retirement plan or applicable law in most situations current law requires that for a qualified contract certain minimum distributions must commence no later than april  following the year the annuitant reaches age   or for qualified contracts other than iras no later than april  following the year the annuitant retires if later than the year the annuitant reaches age   annuity options we offer the following annuity options for payments during the income phase each annuity option may be selected for a variable annuity a fixed annuity or a combination of both we may also agree to other settlement options at our discretion      annuity option a  life annuity we provide monthly payments during the lifetime of the annuitant annuity payments stop when the annuitant dies there is no provision for continuation of any payments to a beneficiary      annuity option b  life annuity with    or  monthly payments certain we make monthly payments during the lifetime of the annuitant in addition we guarantee that the beneficiary will receive monthly payments for the remainder of the period certain if the annuitant dies during that period the election of a longer period results in smaller monthly payments if no beneficiary is designated we pay the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum to the annuitants estate the beneficiary may also elect to receive the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum the discount rate for a variable annuity will be the assumed interest rate in effect the discount rate for a fixed annuity will be based on the interest rate we used to determine the amount of each payment      annuity option c  joint and survivor annuity we make monthly payments during the lifetime of the annuitant and another person you designate and during the lifetime of the survivor of the two we stop making payments when the survivor dies there is no provision for continuance of any payments to a beneficiary      annuity option d  monthly payments for a specified period certain we make monthly payments for a specified period of time from  to  years as you elect if payments under this option are paid on a variable annuity basis the annuitant may elect to receive at any time some or all of the discounted value of the remaining payments less any applicable withdrawal charge the discount rate for this purpose will be the assumed interest rate in effect if the annuitant dies during the period selected the remaining income payments are made as described under annuity option b the election of this annuity option may result in the imposition of a penalty tax the     and year periods certain are not available if your account has been issued within the past  years selection of annuity option you select one or more of the annuity options which you may change from time to time during the accumulation phase as long as we receive your selection or change in writing at least  days before the annuity commencement date if we have not received your written selection on the th day before the annuity commencement date you will receive annuity option b for a life annuity with  monthly payments certain you may specify the proportion of your adjusted account value you wish to provide a variable annuity or a fixed annuity under a variable annuity the dollar amount of payments will vary while under a fixed annuity the dollar amount of payments will remain the same if you do not specify a variable annuity or a fixed annuity your adjusted account value will be divided between variable annuities and fixed annuities in the same proportions as your account value was divided between the variable and fixed accounts on the annuity commencement date you may allocate your adjusted account value applied to a variable annuity among the subaccounts or we will use your existing allocations there may be additional limitations on the options you may elect under your particular retirement plan or applicable law remember that the annuity options may not be changed once annuity payments begin amount of annuity payments      adjusted account value the adjusted account value is the amount we apply to provide a variable annuity andor a fixed annuity we calculate adjusted account value by taking your account value on the business day just before the annuity commencement date and making the following adjustments o we deduct a proportional amount of the account fee based on the fraction of the current account year that has elapsed     o if applicable we apply the market value adjustment to your account value in the fixed account which may result in a deduction an addition or no change     o we deduct any applicable premium tax or similar tax if not previously deducted      variable annuity payments on the annuity commencement date we will exchange your accounts variable annuity units for annuitization units which have annual insurance charges of  of your average daily net assets  if your initial purchase payment was  or more variable annuity payments may vary each month we determine the dollar amount of the first payment using the portion of your adjusted account value applied to a variable annuity and the annuity payment rates in your contract which are based on an assumed interest rate of  per year compounded annually see annuity payment rates to calculate the remaining payments we convert the amount of the first payment into annuity units for each subaccount we determine the number of those annuity units by dividing the portion of the first payment attributable to the subaccount by the annuity unit value of that subaccount for the valuation period ending just before the annuity commencement date this number of annuity units for each subaccount will remain constant unless the annuitant requests an exchange of annuity units however the dollar amount of the next variable annuity payment  which is the sum of the number of annuity units for each subaccount times its annuity unit value for the valuation period ending just before the date of the payment  will increase decrease or remain the same depending on the net investment return of the subaccounts if the net investment return of the subaccounts selected is the same as the assumed interest rate of  compounded annually the payments will remain level if the net investment return exceeds the assumed interest rate payments will increase and conversely if it is less than the assumed interest rate payments will decrease please refer to the statement of additional information for more information about calculating variable annuity units and variable annuity payments including examples of these calculations      fixed annuity payments fixed annuity payments are the same each month we determine the dollar amount of each fixed annuity payment using the fixed portion of your adjusted account value and the applicable annuity payment rates these will be either  the rates in your contract which are based on a minimum guaranteed interest rate of  per year compounded annually or  new rates we have published and are using on the annuity commencement date if they are more favorable see annuity payment rates      minimum payments if your adjusted account value is less than  or the first annuity payment for any annuity option is less than  we will pay the adjusted account value to the annuitant in one payment exchange of variable annuity units during the income phase the annuitant may exchange annuity units in one subaccount for annuity units in another subaccount up to  times each account year to make an exchange the annuitant sends us at our annuity mailing address a written request stating the number of annuity units in the subaccount he or she wishes to exchange and the new subaccount for which annuity units are requested the number of new annuity units will be calculated so the dollar amount of an annuity payment on the date of the exchange would not be affected to calculate this number we use annuity unit values for the valuation period during which we receive the exchange request before exchanging annuity units in one subaccount for those in another the annuitant should carefully review the fund prospectuses for the investment objectives and risk disclosure of the funds in which the subaccounts invest during the income phase we permit only exchanges among subaccounts no exchanges to or from a fixed annuity are permitted account fee during the income phase we deduct the annual account fee of  in equal amounts from each variable annuity payment we do not deduct the annual account fee from fixed annuity payments     annuity payment rates the contracts contain annuity payment rates for each annuity option described in this prospectus the rates show for each  applied the dollar amount of a the first monthly variable annuity payment based on the assumed interest rate specified in the applicable contract  per year compounded annually and b the monthly fixed annuity payment when this payment is based on the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in the contract at least  per year compounded annually we may change these rates under group contracts for accounts established after the effective date of such change see other contract provisions  modification the annuity payment rates may vary according to the annuity option elected and the adjusted age of the annuitant the contracts also describe the method of determining the adjusted age of the annuitant the mortality table used in determining the annuity payment rates for annuity options a b and c is the annuity  table annuity options as method of payment for death benefit you or your beneficiary may also select one or more annuity options to be used in the event of the covered persons death before the income phase as described under the death benefit section of this prospectus in that case your beneficiary will be the annuitant the annuity commencement date will be the first day of the second month beginning after the death benefit date other contract provisions exercise of contract rights an individual contract belongs to the individual to whom the contract is issued a group contract belongs to the owner in the case of a group contract the owner may expressly reserve all contract rights and privileges otherwise each annuitant will be entitled to exercise such rights and privileges in any case such rights and privileges can be exercised without the consent of the beneficiary other than an irrevocably designated beneficiary or any other person such rights and privileges may be exercised only during the lifetime of the annuitant before the annuity commencement date except as the contract otherwise provides the annuitant becomes the payee on and after the annuity commencement date the beneficiary becomes the payee on the death of the covered person prior to the annuity commencement date or on the death of the annuitant after the annuity commencement date such payee may thereafter exercise such rights and privileges if any of ownership which continue change of ownership ownership of a qualified contract may not be transferred except to  the annuitant  a trustee or successor trustee of a pension or profit sharing trust which is qualified under section  of the internal revenue code  the employer of the annuitant provided that the qualified contract after transfer is maintained under the terms of a retirement plan qualified under section a of the internal revenue code for the benefit of the annuitant  the trustee or custodian of an individual retirement account plan qualified under section  of the internal revenue code for the benefit of the participants under a group contract or  as otherwise permitted from time to time by laws and regulations governing the retirement or deferred compensation plans for which a qualified contract may be issued subject to the foregoing a qualified contract may not be sold assigned transferred discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose to any person other than the company the owner of a nonqualified contract may change the ownership of the contract prior to the annuity commencement date and each participant in like manner may change the ownership interest in a contract a change of ownership will not be binding on us until we receive written notification when we receive such notification the change will be effective as of the date on which the request for change was signed by the owner or participant as appropriate but the change will be without prejudice to us on account of any payment we make or any action we take before receiving the change if you change the owner of a nonqualified contract you will become immediately liable for the payment of taxes on any gain realized under the contract prior to the change of ownership including possible liability for a  federal excise tax change of ownership may affect the availability of optional death benefit riders or the expenses incurred with the optional death benefit riders voting of fund shares we will vote fund shares held by the subaccounts at meetings of shareholders of the funds or in connection with similar solicitations but will follow voting instructions received from persons having the right to give voting instructions during the accumulation phase you will have the right to give voting instructions in the case of a group contract where the owner has reserved this right during the income phase the payee  that is the annuitant or beneficiary entitled to receive benefits  is the person having such voting rights we will vote any shares attributable to us and fund shares for which no timely voting instructions are received in the same proportion as the shares for which we receive instructions from owners participants and payees as applicable owners of qualified contracts issued on a group basis

group contracts and payees will be valid as they affect the variable account the company and any others having voting instruction rights with respect to the variable account all fund proxy material together with an appropriate form to be used to give voting instructions will be provided to each person having the right to give voting instructions at least  days prior to each meeting of the shareholders of the fund we will determine the number of fund shares as to which each such person is entitled to give instructions as of the record date set by the fund for such meeting which is expected to be not more than  days prior to each such meeting prior to the annuity commencement date the number of fund shares as to which voting instructions may be given to the company is determined by dividing the value of all of the variable accumulation units of the particular subaccount credited to the participant account by the net asset value of one fund share as of the same date on or after the annuity commencement date the number of fund shares as to which such instructions may be given by a payee is determined by dividing the reserve held by the company in the subaccount with respect to the particular payee by the net asset value of a fund share as of the same date after the annuity commencement date the number of fund shares as to which a payee is entitled to give voting instructions will generally decrease due to the decrease in the reserve periodic reports during the accumulation period we will send you or such other person having voting rights at least once during each account year a statement showing the number type and value of accumulation units credited to your account and the fixed accumulation value of your account which statement shall be accurate as of a date not more than  months previous to the date of mailing these periodic statements contain important information concerning your transactions with respect to your contract it is your obligation to

preceding paragraph we allow a participant establishing an ira a ten day freelook notwithstanding the provisions of the internal revenue code tax considerations this section provides general information on the federal income tax consequences of ownership of a contract based upon our understanding of current federal tax laws actual federal tax consequences will vary depending on among other things the type of retirement plan under which your contract is issued also legislation altering the current tax treatment of annuity contracts could be enacted in the future and could apply retroactively to contracts that were purchased before the date of enactment we make no attempt to consider any applicable federal estate federal gift state or other tax laws we also make no guarantee regarding the federal state or local tax status of any contract or any transaction involving any contract you should consult a qualified tax professional for advice before purchasing a contract or executing any other transaction such as a rollover distribution withdrawal or payment involving a contract us federal income tax considerations the following discussion applies only to those contracts issued in the united states for a discussion of tax considerations effecting contracts issued in puerto rico see puerto rico tax considerations below      deductibility of purchase payments for federal income tax purposes purchase payments made under nonqualified contracts are not deductible under certain circumstances purchase payments made under qualified contracts may be excludible or deductible from taxable income any such amounts will also be excluded from the investment in the contract for purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distributions from a qualified contract      predistribution taxation of contracts generally an increase in the value of a contract will not give rise to a current income tax liability to the owner of a contract or to any payee under the contract until a distribution is received from the contract however certain assignments or pledges of a contract or loans under a contract will be treated as distributions to the owner of the contract and will accelerate the taxability of any increases in the value of a contract also corporate or other nonnatural person owners of a nonqualified contract will generally incur a current tax liability on account value increases there are certain exceptions to this current taxation rule including i any contract that is an immediate annuity which the internal revenue code the code defines as a single premium contract with an annuity commencement date within one year of the date of purchase which provides for a series of substantially equal periodic payments to be made not less frequently than annually during the annuity period and ii any contract that the nonnatural person holds as agent for a natural person such as where a bank or other entity holds a contract as trustee under a trust agreement you should note that a qualified retirement plan generally provides tax deferral regardless of whether the plan invests in an annuity contract for that reason no decision to purchase a qualified contract should be based on the assumption that the purchase of a qualified contract is necessary to obtain tax deferral under a qualified plan        distributions and withdrawals from nonqualified contracts the account value of a nonqualified contract will generally include both i an amount attributable to purchase payments the return of which will not be taxable and ii an amount attributable to investment earnings the receipt of which will be taxable at ordinary income rates the relative portions of any particular distribution that derive from nontaxable purchase payments and taxable investment earnings depend upon the nature and the timing of that distribution any withdrawal of less than your entire account value under a nonqualified contract before the annuity commencement date you must be treated as a receipt of investment earnings you may not treat such withdrawals as a nontaxable return of purchase payments unless you have first withdrawn the entire amount of the account value that is attributable to investment earnings for purposes of determining whether an owner has withdrawn the entire amount of the investment earnings under a nonqualified contract the code provides that all nonqualified deferred annuity contracts issued by the same company to the same owner during any one calendar year must be treated as one annuity contract a payee who receives annuity payments under a nonqualified contract after the annuity commencement date will generally be able to treat a portion of each payment as a nontaxable return of purchase payments and to treat only the remainder of each such payment as taxable investment earnings until the purchase payments have been fully recovered in this manner the nontaxable portion of each payment will be determined by the ratio of i the total amount of the purchase payments be made under the contract to ii the payees expected return under the contract once the payee has received nontaxable payments in an amount equal to total purchase payments no further exclusion is allowed and all future distributions will constitute fully taxable ordinary income if payments are terminated upon the death of the annuitant or other payee before the purchase payments have been fully recovered the unrecovered purchase payments may be deducted on the final return of the annuitant or other payee a penalty tax of  may also apply to taxable cash withdrawals including lumpsum payments from nonqualified contracts this penalty will not apply to distributions made after age   to distributions pursuant to the death or disability of the owner or to distributions that are a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a lifetime annuity or to distributions under an immediate annuity as defined above death benefits paid upon the death of a contract owner are not life insurance benefits and will generally be includable in the income of the recipient to the extent they represent investment earnings under the contract for this purpose the amount of the investment in the contract is not affected by the owners or annuitants death ie the investment in the contract must still be determined by reference to the total purchase payments less excluding amounts that were deductible by or excluded from the gross income of the owner of a contract any purchase payments that were amounts previously received which were not includable in income special mandatory distribution rules also apply after the death of the owner when the beneficiary is not the surviving spouse of the owner if death benefits are distributed in a lump sum the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as upon a full surrender of the contract if death benefits are distributed under an annuity option the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as annuity payments as described above      distributions and withdrawals from qualified contracts in most cases all of the distributions you receive from a qualified contract will constitute fully taxable ordinary income also a  penalty tax will apply to distributions prior to age   except in certain circumstances if you receive an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified contract other than from a contract issued for use with an individual retirement account and roll over some or all of that distribution to another eligible plan the portion of such distribution that is rolled over will not be includible in your income however any eligible rollover distribution is will be subject to  mandatory withholding as described below because the amount of the cash paid to you as an eligible rollover distribution will be reduced by this withholding you will not be able to roll over the entire account balance under your contract unless you use other funds equal to the tax withholding to complete the rollover an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution to you of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of your account other than o a distribution which is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a lifetime annuity or for a specified period of ten years or more     o any required minimum distribution or     o any hardship distribution only you or your spouse may elect to roll over a distribution to an eligible retirement plan      withholding in the case of an eligible rollover distribution as defined above from a qualified contract other than from a contract issued for use with an individual retirement account we or the plan administrator must withhold and remit to the us government  of the distribution unless the participant or payee elects to make a direct rollover of the distribution to another qualified retirement plan that is eligible to receive the rollover however only you or your spouse may elect a direct rollover in the case of a distribution from i a nonqualified contract ii a qualified contract issued for use with an individual retirement account or iii a qualified contract where the distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution we will withhold and remit to the us government a part of the taxable portion of each distribution unless prior to the distribution the participant or payee provides us his or her taxpayer identification number and instructs us in the manner prescribed not to withhold the participant or payee may credit against his or her federal income tax liability for the year of distribution any amounts that we or the plan administrator withhold      investment diversification and control the treasury department has issued regulations that prescribe investment diversification requirements for mutual fund series underlying nonqualified variable contracts all nonqualified contracts must comply with these regulations to qualify as annuities for federal income tax purposes the owner of a nonqualified contract that does not meet these guidelines will be subject to current taxation on annual increases in value of the contract we believe that each fund available as an investment option under the contract complies with these regulations the preamble to the  investment diversification regulations stated that the internal revenue service may promulgate guidelines under which an owners excessive control over investments underlying the contract will preclude the contract from qualifying as an annuity for federal tax purposes we cannot predict whether such guidelines if and when they may be promulgated will be retroactive we reserve the right to modify the contract andor the variable account to the extent necessary to comply with any such guidelines but cannot assure that such modifications would satisfy any retroactive guidelines      tax treatment of the company and the variable account as a life insurance company under the code we will record and report operations of the variable account separately from other operations the variable account will not however constitute a regulated investment company or any other type of taxable entity distinct from our other operations under present law we will not incur tax on the income of the variable account consisting primarily of interest dividends and net capital gains if we use this income to increase reserves under contracts participating in the variable account      qualified retirement plans you may use qualified contracts with several types of qualified retirement plans because tax consequences will vary with the type of qualified retirement plan and the plans specific terms and conditions we provide below only brief general descriptions of the consequences that follow from using qualified contracts in connection with various types of qualified retirement plans we stress that the rights of any person to any benefits under these plans may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves regardless of the terms of the qualified contracts that you are using these terms and conditions may include restrictions on among other things ownership transferability assignability contributions and distributions      pension and profitsharing plans sections a k and a of the code permit business employers and certain associations to establish various types of retirement plans for employees the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of  eliminated most differences between qualified retirement plans of corporations and those of selfemployed individuals selfemployed persons as a general rule may therefore use qualified contracts as a funding vehicle for their retirement plans      taxsheltered annuities section b of the code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of charitable educational and scientific organizations specified in section c of the code to purchase annuity contracts and subject to certain limitations exclude the amount of purchase payments from gross income

becomes disabled within the meaning of section m of the code these restrictions apply to i any post salary reduction contributions ii any growth or interest on post salary reduction contributions iii any growth or interest on pre salary reduction contributions that occurs on or after january   and iv any pre salary reduction contributions since we do not maintain records that separately account for such contributions it is permissible however to withdraw post salary reduction contributions but not the earnings attributable to such contributions in cases of financial hardship while the internal revenue service has not issued specific rules defining financial hardship we expect that to qualify for a hardship distribution the participant must have an immediate and heavy bona fide financial need and lack other resources reasonably available to satisfy the need hardship withdrawals as well as certain other premature withdrawals will be subject to a  tax penalty in addition to any withdrawal charge applicable under the contracts under certain circumstances the  tax penalty will not apply if the withdrawal is for medical expenses section b annuities like iras are subject to required minimum distributions under the code section b annuities are unique however in that any account balance accruing before january   the pre balance needs to comply with only the minimum distribution incidental benefit mdib rule and not also with the minimum distribution rules set forth in section a of the code this special treatment for any pre balance is however conditioned upon the issuer identifying the pre balance and maintaining accurate records of changes to the balance since we do not maintain such records your pre balance if any will not be eligible for special distribution treatment under the terms of a particular section b plan the participant may be entitled to transfer all or a portion of the account value to one or more alternative funding options

full amount of the ira is included in taxable income the internal revenue service and other agencies may impose special information requirements with respect to roth iras we will provide the necessary information for contracts issued in connection with roth iras      status of optional death benefit riders under the code iras may not invest in life insurance policies regulations issued by the treasury department provide that death benefits under iras do not violate this rule provided that the death benefit is no more than the greater of the total premiums paid net of prior withdrawals or the cash value of the ira in certain circumstances the death benefit payable under the contracts optional death benefit riders may exceed both the total premiums paid net of prior withdrawals and the cash value of the contract we have filed the contract and the eeb plus eeb plus mav and eeb plus  rollup optional death benefit riders new riders with the internal revenue service irs requesting a

the  code with respect to qualified retirement plans described in this prospectus vary significantly from those under the internal revenue code although we currently offer the contract in puerto rico

account may publish reports to shareholders sales literature and advertisements containing performance information relating to the subaccounts this information may include standardized and nonstandardized average annual total return cumulative growth rate and compound growth rate we may also advertise yield and effective yield for some variable options average annual total return measures the net income of the subaccount and any realized or unrealized gains or losses of the fund in which it invests over the period stated average annual total return figures are annualized and represent the average annual percentage change in the value of an investment in a subaccount over that period standardized average annual total return information covers the period after the variable account was established or if shorter the life of the series nonstandardized average annual total return covers the life of each fund which may predate the variable account cumulative growth rate represents the cumulative change in the value of an investment in the subaccount for the period stated and is arrived at by calculating the change in the accumulation unit value of a subaccount between the first and the last day of the period being measured the difference is expressed as a percentage of the accumulation unit value at the beginning of the base period compound growth rate is an annualized measure calculated by applying a formula that determines the level of return which if earned over the entire period would produce the cumulative return average annual total return figures assume an initial purchase payment of  and reflect all applicable withdrawal and contract charges the cumulative growth rate and compound growth rate figures that we advertise do not reflect withdrawal charges or the account fee although such figures do reflect all recurring charges results calculated without withdrawal andor certain contract charges will be higher we may also use other types of rates of return that do not reflect withdrawal and contract charges the performance figures used by the variable account are based on the actual historical performance of the underlying funds for the specified periods and the figures are not intended to indicate future performance for periods before the date the contracts became available we calculate the performance information for the subaccount on a hypothetical basis to do this we reflect deductions of the current contract fees and charges from the historical performance of the corresponding funds yield is a measure of the net dividend and interest income earned over a specific one month or day period day period for the available money market subaccount expressed as a percentage of the value of the subaccounts accumulation units yield is an annualized figure which means that we assume that the subaccount generates the same level of net income over a oneyear period and compound that income on a semiannual basis we calculate the effective yield for the money market subaccount similarly but include the increase due to assumed compounding the money market subaccounts effective yield will be slightly higher than its yield as a result of its compounding effect the variable account may also from time to time compare its investment performance to various unmanaged indices or other variable annuities and may

adjustment part  variable account the market value adjustment does not apply to the variable account withdrawal charge calculation full withdrawal assume a purchase payment of  is made on the contract date no additional purchase payments are made and there are no partial withdrawals the table below presents three examples of the withdrawal charge resulting from a full withdrawal of your account based on hypothetical account values         payment         hypothetical free subject to withdrawal withdrawal   account account withdrawal withdrawal charge charge   year value amount charge percentage amount a                 b                 c                                 a the free withdrawal amount in any year is equal to  of all of the purchase payments you have made in account year  the free withdrawal amount is  which equals  of the purchase payment of  on a full withdrawal of  the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is  which equals the account value of  minus the free withdrawal amount of      b in account year  the free withdrawal amount is  which equals  of the purchase payment of  the account value minus the free withdrawal amount is  minus  which equals  however the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is capped at the amount of your unliquidated purchase payments therefore the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is  which is the amount of your unliquidated purchase payments     c in account year  you have passed your fourth account anniversary so no withdrawal charges apply to any withdrawals you make partial withdrawal assume a single purchase payment of  is made on the contract date no additional purchase payments are made no partial withdrawals have been taken prior to the fourth account year and there is a series of  partial withdrawals made during the fourth account year of    and                                      remaining remaining     hypothetical free   amount of     free hypothetical     account withdrawal

                 d                                         totals                  a in account year  the free withdrawal amount is  which equals  of the purchase payment of  the partial withdrawal amount of  is less than the free withdrawal amount so there is no withdrawal charge     b since a partial withdrawal of  was taken the remaining free withdrawal amount in account year  is      therefore  of the  withdrawal is not subject to a withdrawal charge and  is subject to a withdrawal charge of the  withdrawn to date  has been from the free withdrawal amount and  has been from purchase payments therefore the amount of unliquidated purchase payments is      c since  of the two prior account year  partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount the remaining free withdrawal amount in account year  is      therefore the entire  withdrawal is subject to a withdrawal charge of the  withdrawn to date  has been from the free withdrawal amount and  has been from purchase payments therefore the amount of unliquidated purchase payments is      d since  of the three prior account year  partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount the remaining free withdrawal amount in account year  is      the amount of unliquidated purchase payments remaining before this withdrawal is  therefore  of the  withdrawal is taken from purchase payments and is subject to a withdrawal charge and  of the withdrawal is taken from earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge of the  withdrawn to date  has been from the free withdrawal amount  has been from purchase payments and  has been from earnings the amount of unliquidated purchase payments is now equal to  note that if the  remaining balance was withdrawn it would all be from earnings and not subject to a withdrawal charge the total account year  withdrawal charges would then be  which is the same amount that was assessed for a full liquidation in account year  in the example on the previous page part   fixed account  examples of the market value adjustment mva      the mva factor is   i    j  b  n       these examples assume the following  the guarantee amount was allocated to a year guarantee period with a guaranteed interest rate of  or       the date of surrender is  years from the expiration date n        the value of the guarantee amount on the date of surrender is       the interest earned in the current account year is       no transfers or partial withdrawals affecting this guarantee amount have been made      withdrawal charges if any are calculated in the same manner as shown in the examples in part  example of a negative mva assume that on the date of surrender the current rate j is  or  and the b factor is zero the mva factor    i    j  b  n                       the value of the guarantee amount less interest credited to the guarantee amount in the current account year is multiplied by the mva factor to determine the mva    x     represents the mva that will be deducted from the value of the guarantee amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge for a partial withdrawal of  from this guarantee amount the mva would be    x     represents the mva that will be deducted from the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge example of a positive mva assume that on the date of surrender the current rate j is  or  and the b factor is zero the mva factor    i    j  b  n                       the value of the guarantee amount less interested credit to the guarantee amount in the current account year is multiplied by the mva factor to determine the mva    x     represents the mva that would be added to the value of the guarantee amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge for a partial withdrawal of  from this guarantee amount the mva would be    x     represents the mva that would be added to the value of the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge     appendix c calculation of basic death benefit example  assume a purchase payment of  is made on the contract date and an additional purchase payment of  is made one year later assume that all of the money is invested in the subaccounts that no withdrawals are made and that the account value on the death benefit date is  the calculation of the death benefit to be paid is as follows the basic death benefit is the greatest of         account value        cash surrender value        purchase payments   the basic death benefit would therefore be    example  assume a purchase payment of  is made on the contract date and an additional purchase payment of  is made one year later assume that all of the money is invested in the subaccounts and that the account value is  just prior to a  withdrawal the account value on the death benefit date is  the basic death benefit is the greatest of         account value        cash surrender value        adjusted purchase payments    the basic death benefit would therefore be     cash surrender value is the amount we would pay you if you surrendered your entire account value for a description of how cash surrender value is calculated see full withdrawals under the subheading cash withdrawals adjusted purchase payments can be calculated as follows payments x account value after withdrawal divided by account value before withdrawal  x  divided by      appendix d calculation of earnings enhancement optional death benefit example  assume a purchase payment of  is made on the contract date and an additional purchase
