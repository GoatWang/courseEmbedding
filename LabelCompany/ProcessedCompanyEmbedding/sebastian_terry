sebastian terry –  things by geoff mcdonald on november   in book reviews manifesto when are you most alive what are the most weird and most cooky things you’ve ever done whilst this is oneway to look at sebastian terry’s book  things it’s probably not the most useful frame let’s try this instead… what are the things that you’ve done in your life that made you feel most alive stop and have a think about this i think it’s a great life question for instance have you been on a scary roller coaster ride that put you on the edge of your seat have you become a parent and watched with joy and admiration as your child stumbled stood up and then shined or consider the pride you felt at completing that special something that you didn’t think you could feeling fully alive is a super powerful question that builds on what todd henry is talking about in die empty ten things by sebastian terry if you want some suggestions as to some activities that would make you feel fully alive then consider this list of ten things marry a stranger in las vegas deliver a baby – and not yours break a world record get shot yes deliberately set out to get shot perform a marriage ceremony yes a legal marriage ceremony walk across a country eg france get a tattoo appear as a sports mascot crash the red carpet at cannes film festival stay silent for an entire week  things these ten outrageous things are all part of sebastian terry’s  things list it’s a bucket list of things to achieve and yes there are  others amazing things on his list his journey started at the crossroad between completing college and starting a job added to this was the sudden death of a close friend it sparked a rethink of life for seb he asked himself this question if i knew i was going to die would i change anything perhaps right now is a good time to stop and reflect on this question are you ready to die seb asks a great question if i knew i was going to die would i change anything via sebthings click to tweet manifesto my point is not death it’s life and seb’s point is not doing crazy stuff it’s life in particular it’s doing things that bring you to life that brings you fully alive and my interest in this is twofold i want to feel more fully alive and in writing about manifestos i have the tool to do it a bucket list of  things is a form of manifesto it’s a super simple way to express your intent in the world and make a public declaration about it it says ‘here’s what i want accomplish in my life’ the power of public declarations and sebastian terry’s story is a fantastic example of what might happen if you go public with your declarations as he started his adventure he shared it publicly by blogging about it and along the way he attracted a strong following that built a momentum of help and support it reached a point where people were emailing him to help complete his list and this opened up a host of doorways to complete things that seemed impossible or unlikely otherwise for seb sharing his list in public was akin to drinking red bull it gave him wings my top  here’s my top ten… grow a forest –  acres planted with food and other native flora start a research centre publish a book – done that x  now aiming for  books present at ted receive an honorary doctorate speak french – at least have a reasonable conversation in french get married exhibit my art and create a sellout show earn a million dollars – if you knew my bank balance right now you’d be laughing at this thought spend a month in paris painting and visiting the musee picasso –  what’s on your list one of sebastian terry’s  things was to write a book and that’s what we’ve been talking about here it’s an engaging story with short sharp chapters making it an easy read i gobbled it up in two days inspiring stuff so the obvious question is this… what’s on your list what are you the things that you could take on to inspire you to be fully alive leave a public comment below to share some items
