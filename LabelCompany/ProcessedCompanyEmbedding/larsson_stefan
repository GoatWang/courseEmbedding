corp said president and chief executive officer stefan larsson will leave the company on may  the company which will conduct a search for a new ceo said it will continue to execute the way forward plan laid out in june now a hallmark of larsson’s short tenure investors were rattled sending shares of the company down  percent to  in midday trading chief financial officer jane nielsen will lead the execution of the plan until the ceo search is completed ralph lauren executive chairman and chief creative officer said “stefan and i share a love and respect for the dna of this great brand and we both recognize the need to evolve however we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumerfacing parts of the business after many conversations with one another and our board of directors we have agreed to part ways i am grateful for what stefan has contributed during his time with us setting us in the right direction with the way forward plan” the executive chairman said the company has “built a strong foundation for future growth including strengthening our team refocusing our brands evolving our products and our marketing improving our operations and reducing our costs” larsson said that the way forward plan is “on track” he added “ralph will always be an inspiration to me and i am grateful to have had this experience” looks from ralph lauren’s spring collection  photograph by stéphane feugère the news of larsson’s departure was made on the same day the company posted thirdquarter results for the period ended dec  net income fell  percent to  million or  cents a diluted share from  million or  a year ago net revenues were down  percent to  billion from  billion by segment both wholesale and retail net sales saw declines the company said wholesale net sales fell  percent to  million while retail net sales slipped  percent to  billion consolidated comparablestore sales fell  percent but were down  percent on a constant currency basis both components contributed to a net sales decrease of  percent to  billion for the quarter the balance of revenues came from licensing income of the quarterly results larsson said the company lowered inventory levels by  percent to better match demand and “significantly improved our ability to match supply to demand by reducing premarket commitments to  percent of our inventory buys for fall  from  percent for fall ”   larsson said that the firm was still on track to get halfway to its goal of a month lead time by the end of the current fiscal year and  percent by the end of the next fiscal year the company also closed another  underperforming stores during the third quarter the men’s presentation for spring in milan  photo by andrea delbo during the morning conference call to wall street analysts larsson said he remained confident about the ability of the management team to “drive the company back to highperformance” larsson said that as he begins his transition the company’s cfo will “take charge of the execution of our plan jane and i have been copilots since she joined and will work closely together to make this transition successful” nielsen said on the call that the company’s improved discipline in the assortment creation is allowing “us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments… as a result we are by far much more informed which will significantly improve our ability to manage inventory to demand the initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our product has been very positive” she said that the company has begun rebalancing its distribution and its offprice wholesale business as well as looking at quality of sales initiatives in its directtoconsumer ecommerce business “the actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our ecommerce site” she said adding that “ecommerce has been our overpromoted channel and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channels and reduce promotion depth these are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to highperformance in north america they are difficult but necessary actions to build a healthy pace to grow from we expect these actions to continue to the first half of fiscal ” overseas the cfo said store comps improved in europe and in asia despite lower markdown rates she said the company is on track to close  stores in the current fiscal year and has already shuttered  yeartodate “that puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identify from store closures of approximately  million” nielsen said company executives also spoke briefly about border adjustment taxes in response to an analyst question they noted that “there’s not a lot of clarity right now on the various proposals” and that there’s a lot of speculation one executive said the company is “closely monitoring any decisions made by the new administration we obviously are looking across our supply chain and looking for opportunities to mitigate any impact that we might see” the company maintained current guidance for fiscal year  which pegs revenues to decrease to a low doubledigit rate as the company continues to execute on the way forward plan the guidance does not include severance payments in connection with larsson’s departure for the fourth quarter the company said it expects revenues to be down midteens on a reported basis  youre missing

page continue reading the main story photo stefan larsson center with jill stanton and ivan wicksteed at old navy’s headquarters credit jason henry for the new york times san francisco — for years stefan larsson was gap’s worst nightmare as he led hm’s dizzying expansion in the united states with a combination of designer chic and rockbottom pricesthree years ago gap inc hired him and gave him its most challenging brand old navysince his arrival mr larsson has led a striking turnaround at the lowcost label transforming old navy from a butt of jokes to its parent company’s crown jewel last year old navy took in almost  billion in sales in the united states — almost as much in sales as the gap and banana republic brands put together — and made up  percent of the company’s global revenue earnings due this week are expected to underscore old navy as gap’s biggest driver of growth as its other big labels are strugglingstill old navy faces a challenge in sustaining that strong growth in a world of cheap fashion that increasingly seems a race to the bottommr larsson is unfazed “i saw an unpolished diamond in old navy” mr larsson said in a recent interview — his first since taking the helm at the brand — in a corner of a bustling staff cafeteria at old navy’s san francisco headquarters “everything starts and ends with product” advertisement continue reading the main story old navy’s success so far under mr larsson has been built on a level of attention to design that sellers of lowend familyoriented clothes — including the old old navy — had not put into their wares mr larsson calls that view of fashion the “clothes by the pound” approach and says it ignores the aspirations of lowincome shoppers continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the label’s newfound strength also points to a fundamental shift in the way people shop for clothes as well as a new frugality for all but the wealthiest of shoppers in the united states matching a  tshirt with a designer bag has become much more common as shoppers grow more selective about what they will splurge on and even as consumers benefit from lower gas prices and a stronger job market cautious households — especially those with children — have preferred to invest in fundamentals like their cars or homes rather than their wardrobesall that has been a boon to old navy sales at established stores jumped  percent in the fourth quarter by far the fastest rate shown by a mass apparel brand in the critical holiday season“old navy’s approach used to be selling commodities” said betty chen a retail analyst at mizuho securities usa but the more stylish clothes and marketing that mr larsson has brought to the brand have had “a strong halo effect” ms chen said that has bolstered the brand’s image “and price points are so much lower than gap or lululemon”conceived by gap in the early s as a response to efforts by rivals to undercut gap on price the markeddown version of itself was wildly successful at first shoppers were drawn by old navy’s promise to combine the style and quality of gap clothing with the low prices and big selection of a home depot the whimsical layout of the stores with concrete floors and display cases fashioned from strippeddown school lockers was a hit in the workingclass neighborhoods where they opened within four years sales at old navy reached  billion the fastest rate at the time for any retailer even google took longer to reach that milestone gap opened old navy stores at a breakneck pacethat expansion started to go awry in about  right around the time that hm the swedish fastfashion juggernaut opened its first store in the united states in manhattan its strappy dresses and sharp jackets were not only cheap but also were straight off the fashion runways old navy’s laidback hoodies and campy ads started to feel uninspired by comparison a partnership in  with the celebrity designer todd oldham flopped the recession took a huge bite out of retail spending even at the lowend old navy its sales fell by more than  billion from  to  morale hit a lowbrought in to rescue a brand in distress mr larsson set to work assembling a heavyweight team he hired ivan wicksteed former global creative director of cocacola and the architect of brand makeovers at converse and cole haan as chief marketing officer one of the first changes mr wicksteed made was to liven up the company’s drab headquarters in san francisco with pop photography and upbeat music“it looked like a doctor’s office” mr wicksteed said “you have to start with ground zero you have to start with the employees if you can’t get your own people to want to get on board and change direction then you’ll never persuade your own customers to do it” advertisement continue reading the main story another important recruit jill stanton the former head of apparel at nike has transformed old navy’s approach to design previously its merchants would buy clothes from higherend retailers like saks fifth avenue or abercrombie  fitch and pick pieces to adapt often clumsily for old navy stores newsletter sign up continue reading the

newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime “we were taking a product that was in the marketplace and we were bringing it to market maybe a year later” ms stanton said “and our designers were designing for somebody else so you used to get design teams say ‘well i’m not sure if i’d wear that but it’s ok for old navy’ ”ms stanton instead pushed to build old navy’s own design muscle leaning on gap’s supply chain to allow designers to quickly test various prints shapes and sizes in small runs in stores before increasing the production of styles that were with a hit with shoppers it shifted its collection from everyday or basic items to others that were ontrend and in season instead of hiring designers whose experience was in the lowprice market old navy hired top talent an accessories and bag designer from coach athletic wear designers from nike and reebok the men’s apparel director from north face “they don’t start with cheap” ms stanton said old navy’s new ads starring two comedy favorites amy poehler and julia louisdreyfus have gone viralone of old navy’s biggest triumphs has been its pixie pants two years ago just as mr larsson’s team was getting the label’s new look off the ground a designer on old navy’s women’s team noticed that blogs and runways were filling up with casual slimfitting pants the design team “obsessed over every detail” — the fit the cut just above the ankle — and quickly tested different prints and colors in stores the pants were a hit“we uniquely designed that pant and then we put it to market and we tested it and we sold  million pairs last year” mr larsson said “it’s one of the biggest revenuegenerating styles that we have”mr larsson is on the hunt for his next big product“if you were at apple nobody would say ‘let’s relaunch the iphone ’ people would laugh and say that’s crazy but that’s what happens in the fashion industry” he said “if you keep competing with generic products and a higher and higher discount you’re going to lose if apple doesn’t continuously refresh its products and make them current they’re dead and that would happen here as well”a new area that old navy has thrown itself into is active wear for the first time investing heavily in performance fabrics like breathable textiles with sportswear old navy is tapping into a trend that has swept through fashion as sneakers and yoga pants take the place of jeans and pumps but where a pair of yoga pants from lululemon might cost almost  the same amount would outfit an entire family in

makes a significant contribution to sociolegal analysis representing a valuable contribution to conceptual metaphor theory by utilising the case of copyright in a digital context it explains the role that metaphor plays when the law is dealing with technological change displaying both conceptual pathdependence as well as what is called nonlegislative developments in the law the overall analysis draws from conceptual studies of property in intellectual property by using karl renners account of property larsson demonstrates how the property regime of copyright is the projection of an older regime of control onto a new set of digital social relations further through an analysis of the concept of copy in copyright as well as the metaphorical battle of defining the bittorrent site the

built a fashion empire based on sweeping fantasies of countryclub prep and the wild west is stepping down from his post as chief executive of the companytaking the helm at ralph lauren is stefan larsson a former hm executive and president of old navy gap’s downmarket brand which he is credited with reviving old navy has consistently been one of the few bright spots in gap’s brand portfolio since mr larsson who is swedish took over in  making him one of the most visible executives in retailingthe change may be viewed as a move by ralph lauren to get its financial house in order earnings at the upscale apparel company known for its polo brand have been pressured by a strong dollar and intense competition in the luxury space its latest quarterly earnings of  a share topped analyst estimates but revenue dipped  percent on a yearoveryear basis the company’s share price has slumped by almost half this yearin an interview mr lauren  said he intended to remain active at the company he founded almost a halfcentury ago in roles as executive chairman and chief creative officer mr larsson will report to mr lauren though mr lauren characterized their relationship as a “partnership”

story “but i don’t feel like i’m stepping back now” mr lauren saidstill mr larsson’s appointment is the start of a succession at one of america’s bestknown fashion houses which together with the likes of donna karan and calvin klein helped put american style on the mapand it is the coming end of a golden era of american postwar designers ms karan stepped down from the helm of the house that bears her name this year mr klein stepped away from his namesake company in mr larsson  will take over as chief executive of the ralph lauren corporation in november and will also join the company’s board“one of the biggest reasons for me to join is the opportunity to work side by side with someone like ralph” mr larsson said ralph lauren through the years mr lauren has transformed his company into a quintessential american label with its ubiquitous logo of a mounted polo player holding a raised mallet most successful fashion brands are stories of two partners — yves saint laurent and pierre bergé calvin klein and barry schwartz valentino and giancarlo giammetti even giorgio armani and sergio galeotti mr armani took over as chief executive after mr galeotti diedmr lauren was the rare designer who could do both previously he had a “partner” in roger farah former chief operating officer and president who retired in  mr farah was succeeded by jackwyn nemerov another respected executive whose tenure nevertheless coincided with sluggish sales despite steep promotionsbut mr lauren’s decision to award mr larsson the title of chief executive indicates that he at least feels it is still important to separate the roles and have a professional manager running the brand and reassuring wall street mr lauren is still the largest individual shareholder in his company and is likely to have a hand in any major decisions advertisement continue reading the main story investors cheered the move sending the stock as much as  percent higher in afterhours trading the question of who might succeed mr lauren after  years at the company’s helm had cast uncertainty over plans for the future mr lauren’s son david is on the board of directors and heads the company’s advertising and marketing divisionsasked on tuesday whether mr larsson would be a good successor mr lauren replied “i would say so”still an appointment of a new chief executive from outside the company surprised some industry experts“ralph lauren has been a poster child of stability and has historically grown talent from within” said william susman managing director at threadstone partners an advisory firm that focuses on the retail sector “bringing in stefan must be a reflection of the need for new thinking” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the

perfect leather tailoring blue and white evening gowns and stars in the front row jessica chastain julianne moore but his brand has a typical luxury pyramid structure the model for both calvin klein and michael kors with luxury at the pinnacle casting an aspirational halo over the more accessible polo ralph lauren line factory stores below that form the bulk of the profitsgiven mr larsson’s track record in “fast fashion” the question is whether the company will now take a different tack recent moves at the company like separating out its luxury business hiring the luxury executive valerie hermann and opening a lavish private members’ club in milan had suggested a stronger focus on luxury at the apparel companymr larsson has made his name in budgetconscious massretailing first at hm and then at old navy though even at those mass brands mr larsson’s success experts say has been built on fostering a level of attention to design that sellers of lowend familyoriented apparel had previously not put into their wares photo mr lauren’s spring  collection his early success was built on  a countryclub preppy look and he later designed clothing based on wild west themes credit corina lecca for the new york times whether or not changes lie ahead for the company it is a big moment for a fashion house that mr lauren began in the streets of new york selling ties out of rented drawer space in a closet of an office in the empire state building now on top of its men’s and women’s clothing lines ralph lauren has a foothold through licensing in everything from cosmetics to leather goods to footwear and eyeglass frames the company logged sales of  billion in its last fiscal yearmr lauren’s success has made him a rich man though he remains a top shareholder mr lauren has sold off parts of his stake over the years just last week he sold  ralph lauren shares according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission worth some  million advertisement continue reading the main story mr susman of threadstone said that ralph lauren clearly wanted to incorporate some elements of fast fashion given mr larsson’s success in that arena mr larsson will also help ralph lauren bolster its international presence which has become critical as the united states market has become saturated mr susman saidbut he said that he did not expect ralph lauren to step away from building up the luxury side of the business“i don’t envision that would change” he said “and they still have ralph lauren to handle it”mr lauren spoke of the unlikely match between his world of aspirational luxury and that of mr larsson’s in mass retailing a ralph lauren board member had spoken gushingly about a rising star in fashion and recommended mr lauren meet him“so i said ‘where’s he from’ and they told me ‘old navy and hm’ i said ‘why would i be looking for that we’re building a great luxury company’ ”even as the two met for a private dinner in new york mr lauren said “i was thinking to myself ‘why am i here it’s a waste of time’ ”that feeling of initial unease was mutual mr larsson said “i was hesitating why was he interested in speaking with me” mr larsson saidbut the two hit it off“i interviewed lots of people who were in luxury but stefan has a great quality that made me say ‘you can be my new ceo’ ” he said “he’s unique as a man a man who’s capable of building businesses and growing companies but at the same time he’s sensitive to people’s feelings”and was there really something that ralph lauren could learn from hm or old navy“if i thought there was nothing i could learn from stefan” mr lauren said “he would not be here” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage new
