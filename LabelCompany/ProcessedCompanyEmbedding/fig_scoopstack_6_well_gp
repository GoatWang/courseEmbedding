collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscriptcompeting interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist introductionβdglucan a major component of yeast cell walls is known as a potent immunostimulant and has significant augmenting effects on host defence systems  the target immune cells of βdglucan include macrophages neutrophils monocytes natural killer cells and dendritic cells with macrophages being the principal target cells  the binding of βdglucan to these cells triggers phagocytosis and stimulates the release of a cascade of cytokines from macrophages such as tumor necrosis factor tnfα and various types of interleukins ils  macrophages activated by cytokines secrete nitric oxide no which is toxic to tumor cells and microorganisms  therefore by enhancing the host immune function βdglucan exhibits antimicrobial and antitumoral activities a major obstacle to the clinical utilisation of βdglucan as a biological response modifier is its relative lack of solubility in aqueous media  the application of insoluble βdglucans in clinical settings would cause significant adverse effects such as hepatosplenomegaly granuloma formation microembolisation inflammation pain and increased endotoxin sensitivity when administered by parenteral routes   therefore the preparation of watersoluble βdglucans would be advantageous as reported previously by qin et al  to improve the water solubility of βdglucans several methods have been developed one type of method is the chemical modification of βdglucans via for example carboxymethylation – sulphation  and phosphation   through chemical modification hydrophilic groups are introduced into βdglucans and the water solubility of these βdglucans derivatives is improved although the polyelectrolyte formed through these modifications may have different biological properties compared to neutral βdglucans some derivatives of βdglucans have been reported to exert high immunomodulatory activity for example the water soluble βdglucan phosphate can specifically bind to monocytemacrophage cell lines accelerate wound healing and attenuate cardiac dysfunction   the water soluble βdglucan sulfate can activate macrophages stimulate bone marrow and exerts antitumor therapeutic activity   however the degree of substitution ds and molecular weight influence the antitumor activities of the sulfated βdglucan  the water soluble carboxymethylated βdglucan can exhibit mitogenic and antioxidative activity   another type of method is the physical degradation of βdglucans such as through ultrasonic depolymerisation  however the solubility of the weakly degraded βdglucans produced in this manner is not improved as greatly as they are by chemical modification however in almost all procedures used to chemically modify βdglucans the reactions are commonly carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature under strongly acidic or alkali conditions thus the cost associated with solvent recycling and neutralisation and energy consumption are unavoidable therefore it is necessary to develop a simple clean and efficient procedure for preparing watersoluble βdglucans derivatives “mechanochemistry” offers opportunities for developing new and cleaner synthesis procedures with either no or only nominal amounts of added solvent  mechanochemistry refers to reactions normally of solids induced by the input of mechanical energy such as by grinding in ball mills during mechanochemical processing some mechanical energy can be converted to internal energy in the milled solids and thus many metastable active sites can be generated which facilitate the reaction of the solids with other reagents mechanochemistry has been applied in comprehensive fields such as alloy and materials engineering and pharmacology   recently mechanochemical treatment was applied to induce morphological and structural development and to improve the physicochemical properties of some polysaccharides including cellulose   starch  and lignocelluloses  a few reports have demonstrated that milled cellulose can react directly with comilled reagents such as acetic anhydride  and lauric acid  to produce cellulose derivatives such as surfaceacetylated cellulose powder and cellulose laurate indicating mechanochemical processing as a prospective protocol for the solidstate modification of polysaccharides however the ballmilling process is typically timeconsuming in the present study to obtain a watersoluble βdglucan derivative cleanly and conveniently highly efficient mechanochemical processing via planetary ball milling was applied to phosphorylate βdglucan isolated from brewer’s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae within  min the obtained βdglucan phosphate gp was able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophages including phagocytosis production of cytokines such as tnfα and il and secretion of no materials and methods preparation of βdglucan phosphate the mechanochemical preparation of βdglucan phosphate was performed in a planetary ball mill xxm jiaxing china equipped with two jars  ml each the insoluble βdglucan isolated from brewer’s yeast s cerevisiae was provided by shanghai gecono yeast co ltd shanghai china the insoluble βdglucan particles contained  water  protein and  βdglucan among which about  was →linked βdglucan and  was →linked βdglucan before milling βdglucan was mixed thoroughly with sodium hexametaphosphate at different weight ratios ∶ ∶ and ∶ subsequently  g of the mixture was added to one of the jars and milled with  g of balls diameter   mm at a certain rotational speed  or  rads for a certain time   and  min during the milling the jars were cooled by a water bath then the milled powder was dissolved in deionised water and centrifuged at  rpm for  min to remove insoluble βdglucan the supernatant was collected dialysed against deionised water thoroughly to remove excess sodium hexametaphosphate until the elemental phosphorus could not be detected in the permeate of dialysis and finally lyophilised to obtain the gp products at a maximal ds of  gps with different ds could be easily produced by changing the rotational speed milling time and charge ratio evaluation of water solubility the milled powder of βdglucanhexametaphosphate  g was dissolved in  ml of deionised water and centrifuged at  rpm for  min the carbohydrate content of the supernatant and that of the initial milled powder were determined by the anthronesulphuric acid method  the water solubility of βdglucan phosphate was calculated by the carbohydrate content of the supernatant divided by the carbohydrate content of the original milled powder determination of molecular weight by hplc the apparent molecular weight of βdglucan phosphate and native βdglucan ng was determined by highperformance liquid chromatography hplc waters  waters usa eight milligrams of lyophilised gp and ng powder

obtained by using various standard dextrans dextran t t t and t determination of the degree of substitution ds and degree of polymerisation dp the ds of βdglucan phosphate was calculated by the content of elemental phosphorus according to the following formula  which yields the average number of phosphate groups on each glucose residue the amount of elemental phosphorus was detected by spectrophotometric method based on the formation of phosphomolybdate with added ammonium molybdate  using khpo as a standard in this formula p is the percentage of phosphorus content of the βdglucan

absorbance at  nm was recorded on a molecular plus elisa reader molecular usa three wells were used for each gp concentration and three independent experiments were performed neutral red uptake by raw

expressed as the means ± sd a oneway analysis of variance anova was performed for data analysis using spss statistical package for social sciences  software significant differences were indicated at p whereas highly significant differences were indicated at p results preparation of gp by planetary ball milling the βdglucan particles isolated from s cerevisiae were insoluble in water and weakly dissolved in dmso  after milling the apparent peak molecular weight of all of the gps prepared decreased greatly to – kda table  much lower than that of the initial βdglucan material  kda fig  meanwhile the water solubility and ds of each gp sample were also different in accordance with the operating conditions table  among the three operation parameters the rotational speed of ball milling affected the water solubility of the gp products to the greatest extent likely due to the different mechanical forces acting on the materials the water solubility of gp  prepared at a rotational speed of  rads was much higher than that of gp  prepared at a speed of  rads table  therefore the ballmilling process was performed at a rotational speed of  rads in the following experiments download ppt

httpsdoiorgjournalponeg download ppt powerpoint slide png larger image tiff original image table  βdglucan phosphates prepared under different operation conditions httpsdoiorgjournalponetas the milling time increased from  min to  min the water solubility of the gp products increased slightly from  for gp to  for gp and  for gp whereas the ds of the gp products increased significantly from  for gp to  for gp table  indicating that the milling time has a significant impact on the efficiency of the phosphorylation reaction meanwhile the dp of the gp products decreased from  for gp to  for gp in addition the charge ratio of βdglucan to sodium hexametaphosphate also affects the phosphorylation of βdglucan when βdglucan was comilled with sodium hexametaphosphate at weight ratios of ∶ ∶ and ∶ respectively at a rotational speed of  rads for  min the ds of the gp products reached   and  respectively whereas the dp of the gp products decreased to   and  respectively table  indicating that ∶ is a suitable charge ratio for producing gp with a much higher ds meanwhile the polysaccharide yield after this phosphorylation process was about  with the yield during the milling process  and that during the subsequent dialysing process  therefore when operating under suitable conditions soluble gp with a lower molecular weight and high ds could be successfully synthesised by the proposed mechanochemical method energy transferred during the milling process to estimate the amount of energy transferred to synthesised materials via milling and to reveal the mechanochemical mechanism underlying this process several methods have been employed to model the dynamics of planetary ball milling such as the particle element method the use of analyticalnumerical models and the discrete element method  among the various models the one described by magini and coworkers has been well accepted  the following equation was deduced from this model to calculate the power p transferred to a unit mass of milled powder  the values predicted by this equation show good agreement with experimental observations made with respect to milling ball motion and energy transfer according to the above equation the energy transferred to a milled powder depends on the number of balls nb the angular velocity of the vial ωv and plate ωp the geometrical parameters of the planetary ballmilling machine rv rp and db and the milling time t in our experiment the weight of the powder pw   g the number of milling balls nb   the weight of one ball mb  ×− kg the milling time t    or  s the angular velocity of the plate ωp   or  rads the angular velocity of the vial ωv   or  rads the distance from the centre of the plate to the centre of the vial rp  ×− m the radius of the vial rv  ×− m the diameter of the milling balls db  ×− m and the empirical factor related to the degree of filling of the vial φb   among these parameters the angular velocity and milling time are the two most important variables with the former affecting the transferred energy and the resulting mechanochemical reaction more greatly than the latter when milling for  min the transferred power p increased from a value of  kjg for a rotational speed ie ωv of  rads to  kjg for a rotational speed of  rads table  accordingly the water solubility of the corresponding gp product increased significantly when the rotational speed was set to  rads the transferred power p increased linearly from  kjg for a milling time of  min to  kjg for a milling time of  min although the water solubility of three corresponding gp products was similar approximately  the ds of these gps increased from  to  whereas the dp of these gps decreased from  to  indicating that through varying the energy to some extent gp products with different ds and dp could be produced and the energy provided by the planetary ballmilling machine was sufficient to induce the phosphorylation reaction between βdglucan and sodium hexametaphosphate as well as depolymerisation of βdglucan however although the energy transferred to gp gp and gp was same the ds of these three gps varied significantly indicating that besides the energy other factors such as charge ratio would also influence the efficiency of phosphorylation reaction chemical characterisation of gp the structural changes in gp were monitored by ftir as well as c and p nmr spectroscopy the ftir spectra of the initial insoluble βdglucan particles ng and the soluble derivatives gp and gp are compared in fig  the spectrum of untreated βdglucan is identical to that of βdglucan reported elsewhere  with the strong peak at  cm− attributed to o–h stretching the peak at  cm− attributed to c–h stretching and a peak at  cm− attributed to the bending of bound water molecules two new peaks appeared in the spectra of gp and gp a strong peak at  or  cm− corresponding to the p  o bond and a slightly weaker peak at  or  cm− corresponding to the p–o bond indicating that mechanochemical

play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity and are considered the main target cells of βdglucans macrophages act as the first line of immune defence by phagocytosing environmental

environmentally friendly solventfree and convenient method mechanochemical processing to phosphorylate and solubilise βdglucan isolated from brewer’s yeast s cerevisiae was investigated in this study watersoluble βdglucan derivatives βdglucan phosphates with a greatly reduced apparent peak molecular weight of – kda and high ds of – as well as greatly decreased dp of – were successfully prepared by planetary ball milling table  the result indicated that the tight helical structure of βdglucan molecules could be broken and activated to react with sodium hexametaphosphate by mechanical force moreover the phosphorylation efficiency of the planetary ballmilling process was very high because the reaction could be completed within  min indicating that mechanical energy was effectively transformed into the internal energy of the milled materials this transformed energy could improve the chemical reactivity of the hydroxyl groups of βdglucan molecule and increase the number of metastable active sites with which the sodium hexametaphosphate could rapidly react when the insoluble βdglucan was depolymerised and modified with the hydrophilic phosphate groups by this process its water solubility improved significantly most importantly compared to the traditional phosphorylation process of βdglucan which is carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature  our process is convenient clean solventfree and easy to implement the phosphorylation reaction could be performed by a onestep process therefore it may be favourable for environmental and industrial application the presence of phosphate groups in the gp products was demonstrated by ftir spectroscopy fig  as well as c and p nmr spectroscopy fig  and  the obtained gp products were biologically active and able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophage cells of the raw line such as cell proliferation phagocytosis cytokines tnfα and il production and no secretion fig – especially tnfα production and no secretion with gp ds   dp   exerting the highest immunostimulating activity which was similar with the native βdglucan however according to previous reports the immunitymodulating activity of yeast βdglucans depends on the molecular weight glycosidic linkages and chemical groups attached to the main chain phosphated βdglucan with a ds of  prepared by traditional chemical modification in an organic solvent has been reported to exert immunitymodulating activity   βdglucan sulfate with a ds of  and molecular weight of  kda has been reported to exhibit the highest antitumor activity among several sulfated derivatives  carboxymethylated βdglucan derivative with ds of  showed the highest mitogenic activity while derivatives with ds higher than  were inactive  these researches demonstrate that the appropriate ds and chemical group influences the activity of βdglucan in this study a comparison of gp products with the similar apparent peak molecular weight – kda and various ds and dp demonstrated that gp with a ds of  and dp of  exerted higher biological activity than gp with a higher ds  and lower dp  and gp with a lower ds  and higher dp  fig – suggesting that the appropriate ds of phosphate groups and the appropriate dp of βdglucan are the two main determinants of immune cell stimulation meanwhile the biological properties of gp were similar with those of the initial βdglucan particles among which the tnfα secretion of raw cells stimulated by gp were even a little higher than that by native βdglucan the reason for the different immunostimulating activities of these gp products will be researched further in conclusion mechanochemical processing can be used as a simple efficient and clean method to produce biologically active gp which may be attractive for industrial application author contributionsconceived and designed the experiments fs yl performed the experiments js fs analyzed the data fs js yl

processing is an efficient method for preparing watersoluble and biologically active gp with high dsintroductionβdglucan a major component of yeast cell walls is known as a potent immunostimulant and has significant augmenting effects on host defence systems  the target immune cells of βdglucan include macrophages neutrophils monocytes natural killer cells and dendritic cells with macrophages being the principal target cells  the binding of βdglucan to these cells triggers phagocytosis and stimulates the release of a cascade of cytokines from macrophages such as tumor necrosis factor tnfα and various types of interleukins ils  macrophages activated by cytokines secrete nitric oxide no which is toxic to tumor cells and microorganisms  therefore by enhancing the host immune function βdglucan exhibits antimicrobial and antitumoral activities a major obstacle to the clinical utilisation of βdglucan as a biological response modifier is its relative lack of solubility in aqueous media  the application of insoluble βdglucans in clinical settings would cause significant adverse effects such as hepatosplenomegaly granuloma formation microembolisation inflammation pain and increased endotoxin sensitivity when administered by parenteral routes   therefore the preparation of watersoluble βdglucans would be advantageous as reported previously by qin et al to improve the water solubility of βdglucans several methods have been developed one type of method is the chemical modification of βdglucans via for example carboxymethylation – sulphation  and phosphation   through chemical modification hydrophilic groups are introduced into βdglucans and the water solubility of these βdglucans derivatives is improved although the polyelectrolyte formed through these modifications may have different biological properties compared to neutral βdglucans some derivatives of βdglucans have been reported to exert high immunomodulatory activity for example the water soluble βdglucan phosphate can specifically bind to monocytemacrophage cell lines accelerate wound healing and attenuate cardiac dysfunction   the water soluble βdglucan sulfate can activate macrophages stimulate bone marrow and exerts antitumor therapeutic activity   however the degree of substitution ds and molecular weight influence the antitumor activities of the sulfated βdglucan  the water soluble carboxymethylated βdglucan can exhibit mitogenic and antioxidative activity   another type of method is the physical degradation of βdglucans such as through ultrasonic depolymerisation  however the solubility of the weakly degraded βdglucans produced in this manner is not improved as greatly as they are by chemical modification however in almost all procedures used to chemically modify βdglucans the reactions are commonly carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature under strongly acidic or alkali conditions thus the cost associated with solvent recycling and neutralisation and energy consumption are unavoidable therefore it is necessary to develop a simple clean and efficient procedure for preparing watersoluble βdglucans derivatives“mechanochemistry” offers opportunities for developing new and cleaner synthesis procedures with either no or only nominal amounts of added solvent  mechanochemistry refers to reactions normally of solids induced by the input of mechanical energy such as by grinding in ball mills during mechanochemical processing some mechanical energy can be converted to internal energy in the milled solids and thus many metastable active sites can be generated which facilitate the reaction of the solids with other reagents mechanochemistry has been applied in comprehensive fields such as alloy and materials engineering and pharmacology   recently mechanochemical treatment was applied to induce morphological and structural development and to improve the physicochemical properties of some polysaccharides including cellulose   starch  and lignocelluloses  a few reports have demonstrated that milled cellulose can react directly with comilled reagents such as acetic anhydride  and lauric acid  to produce cellulose derivatives such as surfaceacetylated cellulose powder and cellulose laurate indicating mechanochemical processing as a prospective protocol for the solidstate modification of polysaccharides however the ballmilling process is typically timeconsumingin the present study to obtain a watersoluble βdglucan derivative cleanly and conveniently highly efficient mechanochemical processing via planetary ball milling was applied to phosphorylate βdglucan isolated from brewer’s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae within  min the obtained βdglucan phosphate gp was able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophages including phagocytosis production of cytokines such as tnfα and il and secretion of nomaterials and methodspreparation of βdglucan phosphatethe mechanochemical preparation of βdglucan phosphate was performed in a planetary ball mill xxm jiaxing china equipped with two jars  ml each the insoluble βdglucan isolated from brewer’s yeast s cerevisiae was provided by shanghai gecono yeast co ltd shanghai china the insoluble βdglucan particles contained  water  protein and  βdglucan among which about  was →linked βdglucan and  was →linked βdglucan before milling βdglucan was mixed thoroughly with sodium hexametaphosphate at different weight ratios   and  subsequently  g of the mixture was added to one of the jars and milled with  g of balls diameter mm at a certain rotational speed  or  rads for a certain time   and  min during the milling the jars were cooled by a water bath then the milled powder was dissolved in deionised water and centrifuged at  rpm for  min to remove insoluble βdglucan the supernatant was collected dialysed against deionised water thoroughly to remove excess sodium hexametaphosphate until the elemental phosphorus could not be detected in the permeate of dialysis and finally lyophilised to obtain the gp products at a maximal ds of  gps with different ds could be easily produced by changing the rotational speed milling time and charge ratioevaluation of water solubilitythe milled powder of βdglucanhexametaphosphate  g was dissolved in  ml of deionised water and centrifuged at  rpm for  min the carbohydrate content of the supernatant and that of the initial milled powder were determined by the anthronesulphuric acid method  the water solubility of βdglucan phosphate was calculated by the carbohydrate content of the supernatant divided by the carbohydrate content of the original milled powderdetermination of molecular weight by hplcthe apparent molecular weight of βdglucan phosphate and native βdglucan ng was determined by highperformance liquid chromatography hplc waters  waters usa eight milligrams of lyophilised gp and ng powder was dissolved in  ml of distilled water and dimethylsulphoxide dmso respectively and passed through a µm filter for hplc analysis hplc was performed on two linked gelfiltration chromatographic columns of ultrahydrogel™  waters usa × mm eluted with  m nano at a flow rate of  mlmin and detected by a refractive index detector the peak molecular weight of gp was calculated by the calibration curve obtained by using various standard dextrans dextran t t t and tdetermination of the degree of substitution ds and degree of polymerisation dpthe ds of βdglucan phosphate was calculated by the content of elemental phosphorus according to the following formula  which yields the average number of phosphate groups on each glucose residuethe amount of elemental phosphorus was detected by spectrophotometric method based on the formation of phosphomolybdate with added ammonium molybdate  using khpo as a standard in this formula p is the percentage of phosphorus content of the βdglucan phosphate  is the molar

sd a oneway analysis of variance anova was performed for data analysis using spss statistical package for social sciences  software significant differences were indicated at p whereas highly significant differences were indicated at presultspreparation of gp by planetary ball millingthe βdglucan particles isolated from s cerevisiae were insoluble in water and weakly dissolved in dmso  after milling the apparent peak molecular weight of all of the gps prepared decreased greatly to – kda table  much lower than that of the initial βdglucan material  kda fig  meanwhile the water solubility and ds of each gp sample were also different in accordance with the operating conditions table  among the three operation parameters the rotational speed of ball milling affected the water solubility of the gp products to the greatest extent likely due to the different mechanical forces acting on the materials the water solubility of gp  prepared at a rotational speed of  rads was much higher than that of gp  prepared at a speed of  rads table  therefore the ballmilling process was performed at a rotational speed of  rads in the following experimentsfigure hplc chromatogram of native βdglucan ng and three βdglucan phosphates gp gp and gp prepared by planetary ball millingtable βdglucan phosphates prepared under different operation conditionsas the milling time increased from  min to  min the water solubility of the gp products increased slightly from  for gp to  for gp and  for gp whereas the ds of the gp products increased significantly from  for gp to  for gp table  indicating that the milling time has a significant impact on the efficiency of the phosphorylation reaction meanwhile the dp of the gp products decreased from  for gp to  for gp in addition the charge ratio of βdglucan to sodium hexametaphosphate also affects the phosphorylation of βdglucan when βdglucan was comilled with sodium hexametaphosphate at weight ratios of   and  respectively at a rotational speed of  rads for  min the ds of the gp products reached   and  respectively whereas the dp of the gp products decreased to   and  respectively table  indicating that  is a suitable charge ratio for producing gp with a much higher ds meanwhile the polysaccharide yield after this phosphorylation process was about  with the yield during the milling process  and that during the subsequent dialysing process  therefore when operating under suitable conditions soluble gp with a lower molecular weight and high ds could be successfully synthesised by the proposed mechanochemical methodenergy transferred during the milling processto estimate the amount of energy transferred to synthesised materials via milling and to reveal the mechanochemical mechanism underlying this process several methods have been employed to model the dynamics of planetary ball milling such as the particle element method the use of analyticalnumerical models and the discrete element method  among the various models the one described by magini and coworkers has been well accepted  the following equation was deduced from this model to calculate the power p transferred to a unit mass of milled powder  the values predicted by this equation show good agreement with experimental observations made with respect to milling ball motion and energy transferaccording to the above equation the energy transferred to a milled powder depends on the number of balls nb the angular velocity of the vial ωv and plate ωp the geometrical parameters of the planetary ballmilling machine rv rp and db and the milling time t in our experiment the weight of the powder pw g the number of milling balls nb the weight of one ball mb×− kg the milling time t  or  s the angular velocity of the plate ωp or  rads the angular velocity of the vial ωv or  rads the distance from the centre of the plate to the centre of the vial rp×− m the radius of the vial rv×− m the diameter of the milling balls db×− m and the empirical factor related to the degree of filling of the vial b among these parameters the angular velocity and milling time are the two most important variables with the former affecting the transferred energy and the resulting mechanochemical reaction more greatly than the latterwhen milling for  min the transferred power p increased from a value of  kjg for a rotational speed ie ωv of  rads to  kjg for a rotational speed of  rads table  accordingly the water solubility of the corresponding gp product increased significantly when the rotational speed was set to  rads the transferred power p increased linearly from  kjg for a milling time of  min to  kjg for a milling time of  min although the water solubility of three corresponding gp products was similar approximately  the ds of these gps increased from  to  whereas the dp of these gps decreased from  to  indicating that through varying the energy to some extent gp products with different ds and dp could be produced and the energy provided by the planetary ballmilling machine was sufficient to induce the phosphorylation reaction between βdglucan and sodium hexametaphosphate as well as depolymerisation of βdglucan however although the energy transferred to gp gp and gp was same the ds of these three gps varied significantly indicating that besides the energy other factors such as charge ratio would also influence the efficiency of phosphorylation reactionchemical characterisation of gpthe structural changes in gp were monitored by ftir as well as c and p nmr spectroscopy the ftir spectra of the initial insoluble βdglucan particles ng and the soluble derivatives gp and gp are compared in fig  the spectrum of untreated βdglucan is identical to that of βdglucan reported elsewhere  with the strong peak at  cm− attributed to o–h stretching the peak at  cm− attributed to c–h stretching and a peak at  cm− attributed to the bending of bound water molecules two new peaks appeared in the spectra of gp and gp a strong peak at  or  cm− corresponding to the po bond and a slightly weaker peak at  or  cm− corresponding to the p–o bond indicating that mechanochemical phosphorylation between βdglucan and sodium hexametaphosphate occurred during planetary ball millingfigure ftir spectra of insoluble βdglucan particles ng and soluble βdglucan phosphate gp and gp prepared by planetary ball millingthe c nmr spectrum of the initial insoluble βdglucan particles ng in dmsod fig  is identical to those of s cerevisiae βdglucans reported elsewhere  – the initial insoluble βdglucan contains β→ and β→linked dglucosyl units the former component being the predominant one the c nmr spectrum of ng contains the signals corresponding to the carbon atoms of both types of units fig  the main peaks at      and  ppm are assigned to the c c c c c and c of β→linked dglucosyl units    while the small peaks at      and  ppm can be attributed to the c c c c c and c of β→linked dglucosyl units   the c nmr spectrum of the soluble βdglucan phosphate gp ds  in do showed the presence of new peaks fig  the main peaks at      and  ppm are assigned to the original c c c c c and c of β→linked dglucosyl units while the small peaks at     and  ppm can be attributed to the original c c c c and c of β→linked dglucosyl units a strong new peak appeared at  ppm in gp is assigned to the substituted c marked as cs whereas a small new peak at  ppm is designated as the signal of weakly substituted c marked as cs because the chemical shift of substituted carbon will move into downfield and partial substitution will widen the peaks of substituted carbon  this is similar to those observed in sulfated derivatives of →βdglucan with ds of –  and sulfated derivative of α→dglucan with ds of   although the downfield shift of a carbon atom linked by a sulfate group there is – ppm and here by a phosphate group is about  ppm moreover a new peak at  ppm can be assigned to c marked as c′ because c was substituted and thus influenced the chemical shift of the adjacent c  therefore phosphate groups have been chemically bound to βdglucanfigure c nmr spectra of insoluble βdglucan particles ng and βdglucan phosphate gp prepared by planetary ball millingfurther p nmr spectral analysis of the initial insoluble βdglucan particles ng in dmsod and the soluble derivative gp in do was undertaken to confirm the presence of the phosphate group in gp product no signal was observed in ng whereas a strong phosphorus signal was observed at  ppm in gp fig  similar with previously reported βdglucan phosphate   as well as phosphated →αdglucan  confirming that phosphate groups were bound to the molecular chain in addition two small signals were observed at – and – ppm suggesting that other types of phosphate group were present in the phosphated βdglucan derivative perhaps being minor portions of polysaccharide diphosphates and oligophosphates as reported in starch phosphates  this was further demonstrated by a weak signal at – ppm and a strong signal at – ppm observed in p nmr spectrum of sodium hexametaphosphate milled alone milled napo fig  therefore in view of the c and p nmr results phosphate groups have been chemically bound to βdglucanfigure p nmr spectra of insoluble βdglucan particles ng βdglucan phosphate gp prepared by planetary ball milling and sodium hexametaphosphate napo milled aloneimmunostimulating properties of gp on macrophage raw cellsmacrophages play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity and are considered the main target cells of βdglucans macrophages act as the first line of immune defence by phagocytosing environmental particles and pathogens recruiting and activating inflammatory cells and producing a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators such as tnfα ils and no to regulate their own activity and the activity of other immune cells  to examine whether the mechanochemically produced gp was able to stimulate the functional activation of macrophages murine macrophage cells of the line raw were incubated with – µgml of gp product or native βdglucan and cell proliferation neutral red uptake cytokines tnfα and il production and no secretion were measured and compared to the amount produced by the untreated control group three gp products with different ds and dp ie gp with a ds of  and dp of  gp with a ds of  and dp of  and gp with a ds of  and dp of  were measuredeffect of gp on the proliferation of macrophage rawfirst the cytotoxic effect or proliferation effect of three gp products on raw cells was examined the mtt assay indicated that gp gp and gp as well as ng and lps enhanced the proliferation of raw cells in a concentrationdependent manner among which gp exerted the most significant proliferation enhancement effect   and  at concentrations of   and  µgml which was nearly same with the native βdglucan fig a gp and gp only enhanced the proliferation of raw cells significantly at  µgml p and p respectivelyfigure effects of native βdglucan and three βdglucan phosphates gp gp and gp on cell proliferation a and neutral red uptake b of raw cells raw cells were treated with ng or gp   and  µgml or lps effect of gp on the phagocytosis capacity of raw cellsthe amount of neutral red uptake by macrophages was measured to analyse the phagocytic ability of raw cells incubated with gp products and native βdglucan the phagocytosis of raw cells increased significantly after being stimulated by a higher concentration  µgml of gp gp and gp with gp inducing the greatest extent of phagocytosis  which was equal to that stimulated by  µgml of lps fig b however a lower concentration of gp also significantly stimulated the phagocytosis of raw cells  µgml p  µgml p whereas a lower concentration of gp and gp did not but the native βdglucan could stimulate the phagocytosis of raw cells at each concentration in a concentrationdependent mannereffect of gp on the tnfα and il production and no secretion of raw cellsfinally the secretion of two major cytokines tnfα and il as well as a major inflammatory mediator no by raw cells incubated with gp was measured tnfα is an important host defence molecule that affects tumor cells all three gp products and ng as well as the positive control lps significantly stimulated tnfα production in a concentrationdependent manner fig a the tnfα production induced by gp was much higher than that induced by gp and gp and also obviously higher that induced by ng after being stimulated with   and  µgml of gp for  h tnfα production in the culture supernatant increased to   and fold that of the control respectively however gp and gp stimulated tnfα production significantly only at a concentration of – µgml p inducing a level of production – and –fold that

activation induction of acute phase proteins and reduction of the gresidence time of hematopoietic cells ng gp and gp as well as lps induced il secretion in raw cells in a concentrationdependent manner with gp stimulating a higher level of secretion than gp and a lower level of secretion than ng whereas gp suppressed il secretion fig b after being stimulated with   and  µgml of gp il production in the culture supernatant increased significantly to   and fold that of the control respectively gp only induced the secretion of il significantly at a concentration of  µgml pno is a major mediator of macrophages that acts as a destroyer to bacteria and tumor cells a griess assay indicated that all three gp productss and native βdglucan as well as lps induced secretion of no significantly in a concentrationdependent manner with gp triggering the highest level of no secretion and gp the lowest among the three gps whereas ng similar with gp fig  after being stimulated with   and  µgml of gp the concentration of no in the culture supernatant increased to   and fold that of the control respectively after being stimulated with   and  µgml of gp the amount of no secreted increased to   and fold that of the control respectively on the other hand gp only triggered no secretion significantly at concentrations of  and  µgml p therefore among the three gp products gp with a ds of  and dp of  exhibited the strongest immunostimulating activity and was nearly similar with ngfigure effects of native βdglucan and three βdglucan phosphates gp gp and gp on no secretion by raw cellsdiscussionthe application of an environmentally friendly solventfree and convenient method mechanochemical processing to phosphorylate and solubilise βdglucan isolated from brewer’s yeast s cerevisiae was investigated in this study watersoluble βdglucan derivatives βdglucan phosphates with a greatly reduced apparent peak molecular weight of – kda and high ds of – as well as greatly decreased dp of – were successfully prepared by planetary ball milling table  the result indicated that the tight helical structure of βdglucan molecules could be broken and activated to react with sodium hexametaphosphate by mechanical force moreover the phosphorylation efficiency of the planetary ballmilling process was very high because the reaction could be completed within  min indicating that mechanical energy was effectively transformed into the internal energy of the milled materials this transformed energy could improve the chemical reactivity of the hydroxyl groups of βdglucan molecule and increase the number of metastable active sites with which the sodium hexametaphosphate could rapidly react when the insoluble βdglucan was depolymerised and modified with the hydrophilic phosphate groups by this process its water solubility improved significantly most importantly compared to the traditional phosphorylation process of βdglucan which is carried out in an organic solvent at elevated temperature  our process is convenient clean solventfree and easy to implement the phosphorylation reaction could be performed by a onestep process therefore it may be favourable for environmental and industrial applicationthe presence of phosphate groups in the gp products was demonstrated by ftir spectroscopy fig  as well as c and p nmr spectroscopy fig  and ​and the obtained gp products were biologically active and able to upregulate the functional events mediated by activated macrophage cells of the raw line such as cell proliferation phagocytosis cytokines tnfα and il production and no secretion fig – especially tnfα production and no secretion with gp ds dp exerting the highest immunostimulating activity which was similar with the native βdglucanhowever according to previous reports the immunitymodulating activity of yeast βdglucans depends on the molecular weight glycosidic linkages and chemical groups attached to the main chain phosphated βdglucan with a ds of  prepared by traditional chemical modification in an organic solvent has been reported to exert immunitymodulating activity   βdglucan sulfate with a ds of  and molecular weight of  kda has been reported to exhibit the highest antitumor activity among several sulfated derivatives  carboxymethylated βdglucan derivative with ds of  showed the highest mitogenic activity while derivatives with ds higher than  were inactive  these researches demonstrate that the appropriate ds and chemical group influences the activity of βdglucan in this study a comparison of gp products with the similar apparent peak molecular weight – kda and various ds and dp demonstrated that gp with a ds of  and dp of  exerted higher biological activity than gp with a higher ds  and lower dp  and gp with a lower ds  and higher dp  fig – suggesting that the appropriate ds of phosphate groups and the appropriate dp of βdglucan are the two main determinants of immune cell stimulation meanwhile the biological properties of gp were similar with those of the initial βdglucan particles among which the tnfα secretion of raw cells stimulated by gp were even a little higher than that by native βdglucan the reason for the different immunostimulating activities of these gp products will be researched furtherin conclusion mechanochemical processing can be used as a simple efficient and clean method to produce biologically active gp which may be attractive for industrial applicationfunding statementthis work was financially supported by grants from science and technology support project of jiangsu

name password sign in mechanism of borna disease virus entry into cells† daniel gonzalezdunia beatrice cubitt and juan carlos de la torre division of virology department of neuropharmacology the scripps research institute la jolla california   next section abstract we have investigated the entry pathway of borna disease virus bdv virus entry was assessed by detecting early viral replication and transcription lysosomotropic agents ammonium chloride chloroquine and amantadine as well as energy depletion prevented bdv infection indicating that bdv enters host cells by endocytosis and requires an acidic intracellular compartment to allow membrane fusion and initiate infection consistent with this hypothesis we observed that bdvinfected cells form extensive syncytia upon lowph treatment entry of enveloped viruses into animal cells usually requires the membranefusing activity of viral surface glycoproteins gps bdv gp is expressed as two products of  and  kda gp and gp respectively we show here that only gp is present at the surface of bdvinfected cells and therefore is likely the viral polypeptide responsible for triggering fusion events we also present evidence that gp which corresponds to the c terminus of gp is generated by cleavage of gp by the cellular protease furin hence we propose that bdv gp is involved in attachment to the cell surface receptor whereas its furincleaved product gp is involved in phdependent fusion after internalization of the virion by endocytosis borna disease virus bdv causes central nervous system disease in several vertebrate species manifested by behavioral abnormalities and diverse pathology   besides there is accumulating evidence that bdv can infect humans and is possibly implicated in certain human neuropsychiatric disorders         providing further impetus for the study of this novel neurotropic agent bdv is a nonsegmented negativestranded nns rna virus the prototype of a new family in the mononegavirales order  the recent cloning and sequencing of the bdv genome have provided tools to study its molecular biology bdv has a genomic organization characteristic of mononegavirales  however as with plant nucleorhabdoviruses bdv replicates and transcribes in the nucleus   which is unique among known animal nns rna viruses previous studies have suggested that a cellular receptor is required for bdv infection  however little is known about the mechanism by which bdv enters the host cell after adsorption at the cell surface which is a receptormediated event enveloped viruses enter cells by fusing with cell membranes reviewed in references and  this fusion event can occur at the plasma membrane or alternatively the virus can be internalized by receptormediated endocytosis and delivered to endosomes the acidic interior of the endosome will trigger fusion events usually related to a conformational change in a viral glycoprotein gp with fusogenic properties that will allow the viral genome to be released into the cytoplasm amongmononegavirales entry by members of theparamyxoviridae occurs by fusion at the plasma membrane and is ph independent  whereas rhabdoviridae andfiloviridae  fuse only when the ph is acidic along the endocytotic pathway entry of aciddependent viruses can be inhibited by treatment with lysosomotropic agents that raise the intracellular ph and hence prevent endosomal acidification  to examine the mechanisms of bdv entry we developed an assay that allows the detection of the early steps of bdv replication and transcription c rat glioma cells atcc ccl  were seeded in well plates and infected at a multiplicity of infection of approximately  focusforming unit per cell with cellfree bdv prepared as described previously  rna was extracted at   and  h postinfection and bdv rna species were detected by reverse transcriptase rtpcr we used the previously described primers  and  which flank intron i of the bdv transcription map  these primers allow the detection of products of  and  bp corresponding to unspliced mrnaantigenomic rna and spliced mrna respectively fig  in pilot experiments we determined those experimental conditions including multiplicity of infection number of cycles of pcr and time postinfection that would allow a semiquantitative determination of bdv rna levels data not shown view larger version in this window in a new window download as powerpoint slide fig  overview of the rtpcr assay used to detect early bdv replication and transcription the positions of primers  and  relative to the bdv transcription map are indicated cells were left untreated or were treated  h prior and during infection with three wellcharacterized lysosomotropic agents ie ammonium chloride at  mm chloroquine at  μm and amantadine ad at  mm these concentrations have been shown by others as being optimal in preventing endosomal acidification and having low shortterm toxicity  under these conditions entry of viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and rabies virus is effectively inhibited   all three lysosomotropic agents effectively inhibited or greatly decreased bdv rna synthesis fig this effect was not merely virucidal since treatment of the virus with these agents during the adsorption phase did not block subsequent infection upon removal of drugs data not shown therefore we conclude that entry of bdv is ph dependent importantly ad was used in our assay in the millimolar range of concentrations at these concentrations ad is an established phraising compound and has a nonspecific antiviral activity on a number of viruses by blocking their endosomal release  in contrast at lower concentrations micromolar range ad has a specific antiviral effect against influenza a viruses due to a specific blockade of the ion channel activity of the influenza m protein  although ad has been proposed to have antiviral activity against bdv at micromolar concentrations  results from our group  and others  have contradicted such findings view larger version in this window in a new window download as powerpoint slide fig  lysosomotropic agents block bdv infection c cells were seeded in well plates and infected with cellfree bdv the cells were pretreated for  h with the different agents indicated at the top of the figure this treatment was maintained throughout the experiment rna was extracted from the cells at   and  h after the beginning of infection and analyzed by rtpcr a results with primers designed to amplify a region of the bdv genome that contains intron i the use of these primers allows the detection of bdv antigenomic and unspliced mrna top arrow as well as spliced mrna bottom arrow due to the electrophoresis conditions the band in lane  appears to migrate faster than in that in lane  but however it corresponds to the bp bdv amplimer b amounts of rna recovered for each time point pictures of gels were taken with a stratagene eagle eye and scanned with an agfa studiostar scanner and the composite image was generated with adobe photoshop and canvas softwares the requirement of a lowphdependent step for bdv entry suggests that the virion is internalized by endocytosis endocytosis is an energydriven atpdependent process and therefore can be blocked with inhibitors of atp synthesis we examined the effect of energy depletion on bdv entry by treating cells with sodium azide nan and deoxydglucose dgluc which block oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis respectively by using procedures described before  briefly vero cells were preincubated with  nan and  mm dgluc for  h the virus was then adsorbed at °c for  min and infection was carried out for  h with the inhibitors still present extracellular virus was inactivated by incubation for  s with acid glycine buffer ph  fresh medium without inhibitors was added and  h later rna was extracted and bdv rna species were detected as described above energy blockade prevented bdv infection figa lane  however omission of the inactivation of extracellular virus fig a lane  which could then be taken up during the h incubation phase in the absence of the inhibitors resulted in a productive infection and demonstrated that the treatment with the inhibitors of cellular energy production was reversible also infection with herpes simplex virus type  hsv which penetrates cells by direct fusion at the plasma membrane and does not require cellular energy for this process  was not affected by the treatment fig b sodium azide and dgluc also inhibit transport of nuclear proteins and rna although highly unlikely our results could also be due to differences between the nuclear import of hsv dna and that of bdv rna nevertheless our data support the hypothesis that bdv is taken up by the host cell by receptormediated endocytosis and that fusion is ph dependent view larger version in this window in a new window download as powerpoint slide fig  a entry of bdv requires cellular energy vero cells were infected for  h with bdv with or without the addition of  sodium azide nan and  mm dgluc after the infection period the cells were washed and subjected to a brief lowph treatment to inactivate external virus lanes  and  new medium without inhibitors was added and the cells were harvested and analyzed  h later bdv replication and transcription were assessed by rtpcr as illustrated in fig  in a separate rtpcr we used primers specific for gapdh bottom arrow to monitor for the quality of the recovered rna aliquots of both rtpcr products were combined and loaded on

illustrated images were processed as described in the legend to fig  this hypothesis was further supported by the finding that bdvinfected cell lines formed extensive syncytia when subjected to a lowph treatment fig  cells were washed briefly in phosphatebuffered saline and incubated for  min with prewarmed  mm citratephosphate buffer at ph  or  the cells were washed and returned to normal medium one hour later the cells were fixed for  min with  glutaraldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline counterstained with  methylene blue– basic fuchsin in methanol rinsed in water and examined by light microscopy formation of giant multinucleated cells was observed with several bdvinfected cell lines such as c or vero when the cell lines were treated at ph  but not when they were treated at ph  fusion was not observed in the acidtreated uninfected control cell lines fig  since fusion was complete within  h following the ph drop it is likely that fusion is mediated by a viral proteins already present at the cell surface fusion was not observed in  of the infected cells this is likely due to the fact that the expression of bdv gp is restricted in persistently infected cells only a fraction of cells express levels of bdv gp detectable by immunofluorescence  view larger version in this window in a new window download as powerpoint slide fig  bdvinfected cells form syncytia when

described in the legend to fig  virus surface gps are usually involved in the penetration of enveloped viruses by triggering fusion of the viral envelope with cell membranes  we and others have recently characterized bdv gp   we have shown that bdv gp is expressed as two glycosylated products of  and  kda gp and gp respectively gp corresponds to the full length of bdv gp and gp corresponds to the c terminus of bdv gp using a cell surface biotinylation assay described elsewhere  we studied which bdv proteins are present at the surface of infected cells consistent with our previous results we found that among the four major bdv structural proteins only gp is present at the cell surface fig therefore we postulate that gp is likely to mediate the acidtriggered fusion of bdvinfected cells and consequently of virus particles upon infection to investigate whether bdv gp was sufficient to induce fusion we transfected vero cells with a plasmid vector expressing the bdv gp open reading frame under the control of a cytomegalovirus immediateearly promoter by using lipofectamine as described previously  after acid treatment the transfected cells were processed as described above and the number of syncytia was counted we found that cells transfected with the bdv gp expression vector displayed about  times more syncytia defined as foci of three or more nuclei than cells transfected with bdv nucleoprotein np or matrix m protein expression constructs or with a vector without an insert data not shown however the extent of fusion observed was lower than that found in bdvinfected cells this could be due to experimental conditions in particular we observed that bdv gp expression was low and restricted to a limited number of cells despite transfection efficiencies of  to  as monitored by transfection with a vector expressing lacz under the control of the same cytomegalovirus promoter data not shown the reasons for this low expression are presently unknown but recent evidence suggests that expression of bdv gp is tightly regulated  alternatively another bdv proteins as well as cellular proteins induced by the infection could play a potentiating role in fusion bdv p protein the counterpart of the m protein found in other nns rna viruses could play a role in virus entry it has been shown that bdv m protein is glycosylated and that it might be present at the surface of the virion    nevertheless we did not detect bdv m protein at the surface of infected cells suggesting that this protein is unlikely to be involved in triggering fusion of bdvinfected cells view larger version in this window in a new window download as powerpoint slide fig  gp is the only bdv polypeptide present at the cell surface of infected cells bdvinfected c cells cbv or uninfected c cells c were biotinylated with a lipidimpermeable reagent and cell surface proteins were immunoprecipitated with streptavidinagarose beads as described previously  aliquots of the surface fraction surf as well as equivalent amounts of wholecell extracts wce were analyzed by western blotting with rabbit antisera raised against the bdv gp protein a the bdv p np and bdv p p proteins b both antisera being combined in this assay or the bdv p m protein  c arrows indicate the positions of the expected polypeptides images were processed as described in the legend to fig  we have proposed that gp is generated by cleavage of gp by a cellular protease  at the expected cleavage site of gp at positions  to  of the protein there is a motif of  arginine residues rrrrr this sequence conforms to the minimal consensus sequence rkrkrr recognized by furin a cellular calciumdependent subtilisinlike endoprotease furin cleaves many cellular and viral gp precursors including the measles virus fusion f protein  and the gp protein of human immunodeficiency virus type   it also cleaves the hemagglutinin h protein of avian influenza virus  and it has been shown that cleavability of this polypeptide is one main determinant of virus pathogenicity  to test whether furin is responsible for the cleavage of bdv gp we infected lovo cells lovo neo with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the bdv gp vvbvgp lovo cells a human colon carcinoma cell line lacks functional furin because of a single base deletion in the furin gene causing a translational frameshift  cells were harvested  h after infection and analyzed by western blotting for the expression of bdv gp products only gp was detected in vvbvgpinfected lovo cells in contrast production of gp was restored in two vvbvgpinfected lovo cell clones stably transfected with the mouse furin gene lovo fur and fur a gift from n kitamura  fig  compare lane  with lanes  and  furthermore infection of lovo neo cells with both vvbvgp and a vaccinia vector expressing furin vvfurin a gift from g thomas but not with a control vaccinia virus expressing the t rna polymerase vvt also restored the production of gp fig  lane  in contrast production of the bdv p protein was not modified upon infection with vvfurin these results demonstrate unequivocally that furin is the major cellular protease responsible for cleavage of gp and generation of gp however we cannot rule out that other subtilisinlike endoproteases are also able to cleave bdv gp view larger version in this window in a new window download as powerpoint slide fig  bdv gp is generated by cleavage of gp by the cellular protease furin lovo neo cells which lack functional furin and lovo fur and fur cells two clones stably transfected with the mouse furin gene were infected with vvbvgp lanes  to  lovo neo cells were also infected with different combinations of vvbvgp vvt recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the bdv p np protein vvbvp and vvfurin lanes  to  sixteen hours after infection of the cells wholecell extracts were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with the antisera indicated at the bottom of the figure arrows indicate the positions of the expected gp and gp polypeptides additional bands including one close to gp were detected in cells infected with vvt alone lane  and were considered the result of nonspecific binding of the bdv gp antiserum images were processed as described in the legend to fig  members of the mononegavirales exhibit a variety of strategies to enter cells paramyxoviridae such as measles virus have two surface gps the h and f proteins  the h protein is responsible for the interaction with the viral cellular receptor eg cd in the case of measles virus   the f protein whose precursor is cleaved by furin into the f and f subunits along the constitutive secretory pathway induces phindependent cell fusion and allows entry and celltocell transmission of the virus  in some paramyxoviruses interactions between the h and f proteins are required for fusion  in contrast members of therhabdoviridae such as rabies or vesicular stomatitis virus express only a single gp at the surface of the virion this protein is responsible for both viral attachment and fusion upon endocytosis and endosomal acidification  from our previous results and those presented herein we would like to propose an alternate mechanism for the processing of bdv gp and its role in virus entry bdv expresses a single gp as a fulllength product of  kda we have reported that a rabbit antiserum raised against bdv gp which recognizes only the gp product under native conditions can neutralize bdv infectivity  this leads us to hypothesize that gp is responsible for the interaction with the cellular receptor for bdv gp is cleaved by furin to generate gp which is also associated with bdv infectious particles after endocytosis acidification in the endosome will likely induce a conformational change of gp that will consequently trigger fusion a situation mimicked by acid treatment of bdvinfected cells interestingly sequence analysis indicates that the new n terminus of gp which is exposed after gp cleavage by furin is highly hydrophobic this is reminiscent of the fusogenic domain described for surface gps of other viruses such as the h protein of influenza virus or the f protein of paramyxoviruses  nevertheless there is no significant similarity between the bdv gp sequence and the fusogenic peptide consensus sequence derived from f proteins of paramyxoviruses  the bdv genome  kb is significantly smaller than those of the other known mononegavirales  to  kb likely as a result of this smaller size bdv has developed a variety of concurrent strategies for its gene expression regulation these include an overlap of transcription units and transcriptive signals a readthrough of transcription termination signals and rna splicing  bdv gp expression and function represent a new situation in nns rna viruses that is somewhat intermediate between the strategies adopted by paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses the strategy adopted by bdv for the expression of its gp might be related to its exquisite ability to establish persistence animals chronically infected with bdv have high levels of viral antigen and rna in the central nervous system however only extremely low levels of enveloped infectious virions are detected and viral budding has not yet been observed in bdvinfected tissues and cells  this might be related to the restriction of bdv gp expression in infected cells as a consequence bdv gp is poorly recognized by serum antibodies from infected animals the cleavage of gp by furin is likely required for exposure of a new hydrophobic n terminus in gp this new n terminus will in turn be responsible for the phdependent fusion event necessary for a bdvproductive infection despite the localization of bdv gp products in separate cellular compartments both products are associated with infectious virions  hence the accumulation of gp and gp in different cellular compartments may impose additional constraints on the production of infectious particles the low level of virus production may contribute to escape from the host immune response and may favor the establishment of persistent infection previous sectionnext section acknowledgments this work was supported by grants ns  to jct
