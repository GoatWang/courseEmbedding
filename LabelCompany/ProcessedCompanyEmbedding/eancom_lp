international article number also known as european article number or ean is a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type in a specific packaging configuration from a specific manufacturer the standard has been subsumed in the global trade item number standard from the gs organization the same numbers can be referred to as gtins and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by gs ean barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting the most commonly used ean standard is the thirteendigit ean a superset of the original digit universal product code upca standard developed in  by george j

up to  product codesand many manufacturers dont have that many products which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products ean may issue it a longer manufacturer code leaving less space for the product code this results in more

additionally a right  indicator is used to indicate a quiet zone that is necessary for barcode scanners to work properly the international article number also known as european article number or ean is a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type in a specific packaging configuration from a specific manufacturer the standard has been subsumed in the global trade item number standard from the gs organization the same numbers can be referred to as gtins and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by gs ean barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting the most commonly used ean standard is the thirteendigit ean a superset of the original digit universal product code upca standard developed in  by george j laurer an ean number includes a digit gs prefix indicating country of registration or special type of product a prefix with a first digit of  indicates a digit upca code follows a prefix with the first two digits of  or  indicates a japanese article number jan follows the less commonly used digit ean barcode was introduced for use on small packages where ean would be too large digit ean and digit ean are supplemental barcodes placed on the righthand side of ean or upc these are generally used for periodicals like magazines or books to indicate the current years issue number and weighed products like food to indicate the manufacturers suggested retail price contents

prepended  digit in the last few years more products sold by retailers outside united states and canada have been using ean codes beginning with  since they were generated by gsus the  gs prefixes are worth a special mention gs defines this as being available for retailer internal use or internal use by other types of business some retailers use this for proprietary own brand or unbranded products although many retailers obtain their own manufacturers code for their own brands other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store for example items weighed and served over a counter for a customer in these cases the barcode may encode a price quantity or weight along with a product identifier  in a retailer defined way the product identifier may be one assigned by the produce electronic identification board peib or may be retailer assigned retailers who have historically used upc barcodes tend to use gs prefixes starting with  for storepackaged productscitation needed the ean country code  and later  has been allocated since the s to reserve a unique country code ucc prefix for ean identifiers of published books regardless of country of origin so that the ean space can catalog books by isbns rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system this is informally known as bookland the prefix  with first digit  is used for international standard music number ismn and the prefix  indicates international standard serial number issn manufacturer codeedit the manufacturer code is a unique code assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the gs prefix all products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code ean uses what is called variablelength manufacturer codes assigning fixedlength digit manufacturer codes as the ucc has done until recently means that each manufacturer can have up to  product codesand many manufacturers dont have that many products which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products ean may issue it a longer manufacturer code leaving less space for the product code this results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes in isbn and issn this component is used to identify the language in which the publication was issued and managed by a transnational agency covering several countries or to identify the country where the legal deposits are made by a publisher registered with a national agency and it is further subdivided any allocating subblocks for publishers many countries have several prefixes allocated in the issn and isbn

publisher in order to avoid creating gaps however it happens that a registered book or serial never gets published and sold check digitedit the check digit is an additional digit used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly it is computed modulo  where the weights in the checksum calculation alternate  and  in particular since the weights are relatively prime to  the ean system will detect all single digit errors it also recognizes  of transposition errors all cases where the difference between adjacent digits is not  calculation of checksum digitedit the checksum is calculated as sum of products  taking an alternating weight value  or  times the value of each data digit the checksum digit is the digit which must be added to this checksum to get a number divisible by  ie the additive inverse of the checksum modulo  see isbn check digit calculation for a more extensive description and algorithm the global location numbergln also uses the same method position  weightedit the weight at a specific position in the ean code is alternating  or  in a way that the final data digit has a weight of  and thus the check digit has a weight of  all global trade item number gtin

group of  the first group of  is encoded using a pattern whereby each digit has two possible encodings one of which has even parity denoted with letter g and one of which has odd parity denoted with letter l the first digit is encoded indirectly by selecting a pattern of choices between these two encodings for the first group of  digits according to the table below unlike the other digits the first digit is not represented directly by a pattern of bars and spaces all digits in the last group of  digits are encoded using a single pattern rrrrrr the one also used for upc if the first digit is zero all digits in the first group of  are encoded using the pattern llllll used for upc therefore an upc barcode is also an ean barcode with the first digit set to zero structure of ean first

the gtin numbers encoded to upca ean and ean all use similar encoding the encoded information is repeated in plain text below the barcode ean encodingedit the digit ean number can be divided into  groups first digit left group of  digits right group of  digits the barcode consists of  equally spaced areas also called modules from left to right  areas to encode the start marker   areas making up the left group of  digits this can be further subdivided into  subgroups each consisting of seven areas the subgroups encode digits  each of these encodings can have even or odd parity the parities taken together indirectly encode the first digit of ean  areas to encode the marker for the center of the barcode   areas making up the right group of  digits this can be further subdivided into  subgroups each consisting of seven areas the subgroups encode digits  digits  are all encoded with even parity digit  is the check digit  areas to encode the end marker each area can be black bar  or white space  a maximum of four black bar areas can be grouped together these make up a wide black bar likewise a maximum of four white space areas can be grouped together these make up a wide white space the start marker and the end marker are encoded as  the center marker is encoded as  each digit in ean except digit  which is not directly encoded consists of seven areas a decimal digit is encoded so that it consists of two wide bars and two wide spaces the digits in the left group are encoded so that they always start with a white space and end with a black bar the digits in the right group are encoded so that they always start with a black bar and end with a white space finally the combination of variablewidth black bars and white spaces encodes the ean number the encoding is described in the following table digit digit encoding barspace widths total of  ean encoding in relation to digit  left right left odd even even odd even       oooooo eeeeee       ooeoee eeeeee

encodings left odd left even right left even and right are mirrorsymmetrical to each other left odd is the bitwise inverse of right the first digit from the left group is always encoded with odd parity and the last digit of the right group is always encoded with even parity thus it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right the scanning software can determine what is the beginning and end of the barcode with the help of the fact that the first digit should have odd parity and the last digit should have even parity ean barcode exampleedit ean barcode a green bar indicates the black bars and white spaces that encode a digit c cstartend marker c marker for the center of the barcode  digits in the left group   digits in the right group the last digit is the check digit  a digit is encoded in seven areas by two black bars and two white spaces each black bar or white space can have a width between  and  areas parity for the digits from left and right group oeooee eeeeee o  odd parity e  even parity the first digit in the ean code the combination of parities of the digits in the left group indirectly encodes the first digit  the complete ean code is thus    decodingedit scanning part of an ean barcode by using the barcode center marker it is possible for a barcode scanner to scan just one half of the barcode at a time this

trade item number standard from the gs organization the same numbers can be referred to as gtins and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by gs ean barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting the most commonly used ean standard is the thirteendigit ean a superset of

obtain their own manufacturers code for their own brands other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store for example items weighed and served over a counter for a customer in these cases the barcode may encode a price quantity or weight along with a product identifier  in a retailer defined way the product identifier may be one assigned by the produce

product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products ean may issue it a longer manufacturer code leaving less space for the product code this results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes in isbn and issn this component is used to identify the

digit left group of  digits right group of  digits the barcode consists of  equally spaced areas also called modules from left to right  areas to encode the start marker   areas making up the left group of  digits this can be further subdivided into  subgroups each consisting of seven areas the subgroups encode digits  each of these encodings can have even or odd parity the parities taken together indirectly encode the first digit of ean  areas to encode the marker for the center of the barcode   areas making up the right group of  digits this can be further subdivided into  subgroups each consisting of seven areas the subgroups encode digits  digits  are all encoded with even parity digit  is the check digit  areas to encode the end marker each area can be black bar  or white space  a maximum of four black bar areas can be grouped together these make up a wide black bar likewise a maximum of four white space areas can be grouped together these make up a wide white space the start marker and the end marker are encoded as  the center marker is encoded as  each digit in ean except digit  which is not directly encoded consists of seven areas a decimal digit is encoded so that it consists of two wide bars and two wide spaces the digits in the left group are encoded so that they always start with a white space and end with a black bar the digits in the right group are encoded so that they always start with a black bar and end with a white space finally the combination of variablewidth black bars and white spaces encodes the ean number the encoding is described in the following table digit digit encoding barspace widths total of  ean encoding in relation to digit  left right left odd even even odd even       oooooo eeeeee       ooeoee eeeeee       ooeeoe eeeeee

left even right left even and right are mirrorsymmetrical to each other left odd is the bitwise inverse of right the first digit from the left group is always encoded with odd parity and the last digit of the right group is always encoded with even parity thus it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right the scanning software can determine what is the beginning and end of the barcode with the help of the fact that the first digit should have odd parity and the last digit should have even parity ean barcode exampleedit ean barcode a green bar

barcodes for nonprofits are upca and ean the same posted by phil peretz  · tuesday january rd   before you buy a barcode we have written this tutorial to help you understand the differences between upc barcodes and ean barcodes below are both an ean barcode and a upc barcode the ean contains a  digit number and the upc contains a  digit number ean   upc   or  the gs the original source for barcodes has created the confusion between upc universal product codes and ean european article numbers also called international article numbers the upca barcode was the original format for product barcodes as demand in europe asia and australia started growing country codes were added  us and canada have a a country code of zero which is not printed under the barcode nor is it entered in us and canadian inventory and point of sale databases if you look at the graphics above you will see they are exactly the same the width of the bars and the width of the spaces between the bars are exactly the same the only major difference is the placement of the numbers below human readable numbers which are there only as a backup in case the barcode doesn’t scan properly and the information has to be manually entered into the point of sale system taking this a step further we have overlaid the upc and the ean graphics symbologies so you can see that the graphic is identical the country code doesn’t appear beneath the barcode in a upc since the gs didn’t grasp the importance of us  and canada indicating country codes they felt that since the majority of products sold in both countries originate from importers distributors or manufacturers in the   us or canada they could forego the leading zero in the human readable numbers we still believe that if you are currently doing business in the united states and canada exclusively it is safer to order upc barcodes for your products many retailers especially smaller retailers may be using older accounting and inventory systems that only allow them to enter in  digit upc numbers and not a  digit string if this changes in the future you can convert your  digit upc to a  digit ean by adding in the country code   there is nothing on the horizon indicating that the us and canada will ever switch over to ean  barcodes this following information is used with permission from george laurer– httpwwwlaurerupccom  mr laurer is the inventor of the upc barcode there seems to be considerable confusion concerning the difference and use of the upc code and ean codes “upc version a” and “ean” are and always have been  character symbols and the numbers themselves have always been  characters long the upc version a symbol and the ean symbol are essentially one and the same they both have the same number of bars and spaces  i have used the name ucc throughout to avoid confusion although it evolved to this name over many years in  it was called upcc uniform product code council the origin of ean vs upc confusion when i conceived the upc for the grocers in the us only  digits were required including the check character i designed a symbol in which the left half of the symbol was composed of “odd” parity characters and the right side was composed of “even” parity characters each printed character has two bars and two spaces and is made up of  modules odd parity simply means the printed representation of the numeric digit has an odd number of dark modules conversely even parity printed digits have an even number of dark modules the ucc chose to call the upc a  character symbol and they chose to print only  of the characters in human readable form the  characters identifying the manufacturer and item were printed below the bars the “system number” character was printed halfway up the left side further they chose to carry only  digits of the number in their files the reason was both political and practical before the symbol marking was considered a well know consulting firm had been hired by the fledgling ucc to determine the number of digits needed to accomplish the goals of the grocery industry considering many factors not the least of which was the limited power of computers of the day a figure of  digits was recommended it was a tough sell to convince the many groups involved that they would have to change whatever numbering system they were using to the new  digit number rather than admit that the consulting firm was wrong and so as not to open the number of digit argument again the decision was to maintain that the upc was a  digit symbol and number another factor considered was that it was more difficult to key the ean human readable that the upc human readable when the symbol did not scan they fostered the illusion by requiring that the check digit be stripped at the scanner the sn system number was necessary for in store processing but it was not needed in records transferred between systems the illusion was reinforced by not printing the sn in line with the  product identifying digits and not printing the check digit at all after the upc had been in use several years europerecognized the usefulness of the upc but realized a th digit was needed to identify the many countries i encoded the extra digit by encoding the left half of the symbol with  characters of even parity and  characters of odd parity and then arranging them in various patterns each pattern representing a different country code the scanner recognizes a series of digits as the right half of a symbol if the parity of the characters is all even and it recognizes the left half if it is composed of all odd or if three characters are odd parity and three characters are even parity characters with the acceptance of the ean in europe it was understood that the upc was actually  digits because the parity pattern of the left half of all odd characters was assigned the value or country flag of “” i pointed out that the ucc only printed  of the  digits and carried only  digits in the system the ucc continued the delusion by using the foolish argument that “” means nothing and therefore could be ignored on the other hand the european’s were smart enough from the very outset to call the ean symbol what it is “ean” and they printed all  characters systems in europe carried all  country flags including  in their records and their systems could process both upc and ean symbols andor numbers the  us groceries chains at the time were selling very few foreign goods and saw no reason to spend money modify their installed equipment although the upc was not widely accepted at that time the ucc accommodated the foreign companies by issuing them upc numbers with the invisible country flag of “” although this was a burden on the european companies and was a waste of numbers since many european companies had both upc and ean numbers it wasn’t until two decades later that something was done about this in  the uniform code council inc announced project sunrise this initiative required that all us and canadian companies must be capable of scanning and processing ean symbols in addition to upc symbols at pointofsale by january  this has been completed the ucc has changed its name to gs us and they have taken the responsibility of controlling both upc and ean numbers simply put the upc and ean symbols and numbers are the same below is a upc symbol with its equivalent ean superimposed in red one can see that the bars and space are the same only the human readable is different note that the upc has evolved in that the check digit is now printed and also that the sn has been brought down in line with the other characters but the country flag is still not printed i would expect that in the near future the human readable will also be changed to the ean format because there are more than  countries the country flags have been further subdivided by using the next two digits for various uses and countries the united  states and canada have the country flag  and subdivisions  thru  it is interesting to note that the publishing industry produces so many products that it is its own country called “bookland” for number assignment purposes bookland has been given two subdivisions of the country flag  they are  and  –end of article by george laurer           click here to fill out support email toll free  infonationwidebarcodecom amazon upcsclick
