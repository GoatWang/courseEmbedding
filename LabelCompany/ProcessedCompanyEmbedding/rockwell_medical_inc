replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysisdependent chronic kidney disease the approval and commercialization of triferic was based upon the results of a successful year fda clinical development program that included two  in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies five  safety pharmacology studies four  chronicrepeatdose general toxicity studies three  genotoxicity studies six  reproductive and developmental toxicology studies six  phase i and  clinical studies and three  randomized controlled phase  studies in total more than  doses of triferic were safely administered as part of the clinical development program building upon that success rockwell is now developing new triferic formulations targeting the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in other renal and cancer markets these formulations include triferic iv solution for chronic or acute care intravenous use triferic tpn solution for total parenteral nutrition acute care applications triferic pd solution for peritoneal dialysis in the home and triferic orphan indication to treat ironrefractory irondeficiency anemia irida in addition to triferic rockwell has received fda approval to market calcitriol iv injection the lowest cost lowest dose active form vitamin d to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism shpt in dialysis patients the  mcg dose injection packaged in vials is designed to be cost effectively administered during each dialysis session calcitriol is more potent than branded vitamin d drugs and is shown to be therapeutically equivalent in safety and efficacy to these agents
