growth fact sheet part of the new multiple portfolio fund approved by the fsc offering circular what is the capital growth fund a capital growth fund is a pool of investments which has the potential to grow the fund consists of stocksshares and fixed income investments stocks are the only opportunities where capital can grow however while investments in equities can grow they can also lose their value by falling prices money market instruments on the other hand offer the security of capital but while this value remains fixed and secure inflation over time eats away at its real purchasing value what are the investments in the fund the trust deed does not restrict the maximum investment in equities but sets a maximum of  in fixed income however not more than  of the portfolio can be invested in the shares of any one company the mix of investments is a feature of barita capital growth fund that meets our portfolio goals of growth and security why should i invest in the fund the capital growth fund is for investors who are investing for the long run five to ten years and are interested in providing a hedge against inflation the portfolio is comprised of blue chip stocks which have a track record of growth and good dividends over the long term the fund has shown excellent results the fund is governed and secured by a trust deed and the securities are held by the trustee are the gains guaranteed no the price of units in any fund can fluctuate that is go up or down because the investment risks are spread over a wide portfolio however the element of fluctuation is reduced while capital growth funds tend to have a fair degree of risk they also have a greater potential than the money market fund for increasing the value of your investment historically in the long run the units usually make significant gains how do you calculate the returns the trust deed requires that prices of the funds are published at least once per week in the newspaper this information tells you the price you can sell your units for and the price you may buy units at to value your units simply multiply the number of units held by the published bid price and subtract from the cost purchased for example  units     subtracted from  invested     gain for the year every week all investments of the fund are valued at both the bid and ask prices prevailing in the market in addition charges are added as specified in the trust deed only charges allowed by the trust deed can be charged against the fund are there tax liabilities no the fund enjoys full government taxfree status this means that in addition to the taxfree dividends received by the fund gains made on investments are totally taxfree how do i buy units in the fund an application form must be completed and signed and accompanied
