form search share on facebook tweet widget google plus one linkedin share button pinterest managed future funds fees  expenses class action lawsuit in november  bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managedfutures” funds  the conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled  of all the profit of that given fund a managedfutures fund  is an alternative investment which is often defined as an investment other than cash stocks or bonds  typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments  barcalyhedge estimates that over  billion was invested in managed accounts in mid  sec reporting requirements  one difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” the sec does however require that all managed futures funds with more than  investors and more than  million in assets file financial reports within  days of their fiscal year’s end  bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently  managedfutures funds that fit into this category the vast majority of managedfutures funds therefore have no reporting requirement as they are not subject to the  investor rule bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses bloomberg concluded that managedfutures funds can charge clients  to  each year of the investment amount in the fund plus  percent of the funds’ profits  hedge funds typically only charge a  management fee plus  of investor profits bloomberg next concluded that for the period from jan   to dec   a stunning  of the  billion of gains in these  managedfutures funds went to fees commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors  one example morgan stanley smith barney spectrum technical lp  people invested approximately  million in morgan stanleys managedfutures fund called

securities arbitration  litigation investment products managed futures funds managed futures funds managed futures funds constitute a  billion market and many large brokerage firms have setup their own managed futures funds and recommended thousands of investors place their assets in these funds however a bloomberg article has raised questions concerning the suitability of managed futures funds according to the article from  to   of the futures fund trading profits and interest for  secregistered funds were consumed by fees and commissions leaving investors with little profit for their investment in the wake of the article’s revelations the commodity futures trading commission cftc has opened an investigation into the high fees charged to investorsas a background the expected gross return to a fully collateralized futures position equals the return to a cash investment plus compensation for the risk borne in the collateral investment for stocks and stock index futures the compensation is the expected return on the stock market for other underlying investments the expected returns is often less thus a managed futures fund investment with  to  annual expenses on average will earn much less than stocks and bonds over the same period of time due to the commissions and fees taken from the fund by the managers and the brokerage firm each year that would otherwise be available to the investorsthe failure of managed futures funds is also backed up by empirical research from january  through the end of  the bloomberg article found that morgan stanley had  customers to invest  million into a managedfutures fund called morgan stanley smith barney spectrum technical lp the prospectus for spectrum technical fund stated that the fund was potentially profitable “when traditional markets are experiencing losses” and recommended the fund as a way to diversify an investor’s holdings beyond traditional stocks and bonds the prospectus also allegedly boasted that over a twentythree year period investors who placed ten percent of their assets in managed futures outperformed portfolios comprised only of stocks and bondsthe spectrum technical fund earned  million in trading gains and income from  through  according to the article nonetheless investors who remained in the fund during this period did not receive any of the returns because the manager’s and morgan stanley’s commissions expenses and fees paid totaled  million thus spectrum technical investors lost  million for no other reason than the fees charged to the fund were greater than the gainsbelow are
