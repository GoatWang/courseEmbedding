university of northern colorados monfort college of business deans leadership council twst please give us a brief history of three peaks capital management mr rufenacht after being at janus for fourteen years running the high yield bond fund i left in  to establish three peaks capital management initially three peaks managed assets for high net worth individuals corporations foundations pension accounts etc in june of  we launched the aquila three peaks high income fund with the aquila group of funds of new york as a joint venture to service the mutual fund spectrum today three peaks has about  billion under management the public mutual fund is about  million with the balance comprised of separately managed accounts weve grown quite quickly with the majority of the assets we manage invested in the high yield asset class twst what sectors does three peaks avoid and which ones are the firm investing in right now mr rufenacht as ive mentioned we focus on the more stable sectors of the economy and avoid ones that are still in their infancy stages we generally avoid the highly cyclical sectors which are steel paper chemical autos airlines financials restaurants and retailers over the years it has become apparent that companies in these sectors have difficulty supporting debt when the economy slows and consumer reduces spending we focus our investments and therefore time and efforts in more mature industries such as energy health care telecom supermarket and packaging sectors companies such as ball container corp bll and owensillinois oi are solid businesses which produce products that consumers and business like need and want cable television is another area that we are attracted to even in a recessionary period people pay their cable bill death care names such as service corp international sci are attractive as they have a sound business model in an industry that will never go away we own corrections corporation cxw which are jails and prisons in many states such as california an inmateoverpopulation problem has emerged and private inmate facilities like corrections corporation are the cheapest way to solve the problem we also own movie theaters such as regal rgc and amc again like cable these are an inexpensive form of entertainment ive been covering the theater sector since about  and there was a period where the movie industry had gotten to over capacity too many theaters had been built and too much debt had accumulated this has since been rectified and it has become a good business model we are focused on the sectors and industries that we think are based in need and necessity we place a heavy emphasis on knowing what is going on in the energy and health care sectors because the need for both is extremely high but so are the regulations and political banter involved with both investing in companies that are operating in stable sectors despite the direction of the economy helps to eliminate volatility lastly not only do we not invest in emerging markets we dont invest in internationalbased companies or domestic companies that have a high exposure to emerging markets our research is based on speaking and meeting with the management teams regularly and seeing the companys assets as often as possible which becomes more difficult if we have to call internationally or fly around the world there are hundreds if not over a thousand companies in the high yield market that are based in the united states and have the majority of their operations in north america we dont need to have the added risks associated with nonus companies in order to generate a stable return the wall street transcript is a unique service for investors and industry researchers  providing fresh commentary and
