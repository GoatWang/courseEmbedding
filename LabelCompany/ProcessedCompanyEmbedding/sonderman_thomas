college job details emmaus parish has grown dramatically in the past eight years from  families when our church was dedicated in january  to nearly  families today this growth has brought us many blessings including the enrichment of our spiritual lives through flourishing ministries that now count over  our growth also brings challenge and change we have struggled for years to meet critical space needs at emmaus demographic studies indicate tremendous ongoing growth in the south lake travis area and this growth means an increasing catholic population and growing demands on emmaus catholic parish and our flourishing ministries we are at a defining moment in the history of emmaus as we move forward we must take the steps necessary to better serve our current  families and ensure that we will be able to serve all who come to us in the future we are called upon to build a parish activity center pac to meet the needs of a vibrant growing and increasingly diverse parish population our dedication to our catholic faith our ministries and to future generations calls for nothing less than this critical investment the good news is that we are almost there with detailed plans leading us to enjoying a beautiful new  sq ft facility by the fall of  a detailed building design and construction budget of  million are in place the result of many years of hard work by the building committee and consensus building through the involvement of hundreds of parishioners some twothirds of the necessary funding is already in place first our building fund has grown to over  million is still growing and will provide over onethird of the necessary capital second the diocese of austin has approved a loan that will provide a little under onethird of the goal finally we are embarking on a capital campaign to provide the last piece of needed funding this undertaking will require the participation of all emmaus families this is central to the call to christian stewardship as members of gods faithful people all of us must participate through the sharing of time talent and resources in sharing in christs work of making the kingdom of god more present to us in this life that is the mission given to us by christ himself together we will is a major step in fulfilling our mission in christ and should be recognized by each of us as the single most profound way we can influence the future of emmaus catholic parish those who came before us  some of whom are with us today  had the faith and courage to plan with confidence for the beautiful church we enjoy today however the work of creating faith community is not limited to those who were here at the beginning we all share in the ongoing call to be part of the building up of our faith community and the church as a whole our call now in this time in the history of our parish is to build upon their faith and dedication to embrace the future there is a place for every family to become involved in our campaign effort and we need every family to participate please pray about what emmaus catholic parish means to you and your family i am confident that each of you grateful for the gifts you have received from god and others will do all that is in your power to make this endeavor a success only together will we build the kind of facility that will empower our growing and dynamic community of faith to foster
