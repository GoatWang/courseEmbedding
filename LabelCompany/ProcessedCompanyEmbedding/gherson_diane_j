search  advanced search comment period begins for ot rule bring change to mind biggest hcm deal for infor hr disrupted ibms chro shares her view of the next agenda for delivering value by diane j gherson monday june   the following is a selected essay appearing in the rise of hr wisdom from  thought leaders it isnt often that a group of professionals can say with confidence that they stand at an important moment in history this is one such moment for hr if that sounds like overreach step back and consider the moment in which we find ourselves today over the past decade we have seen the convergence of three historic shifts that are reshaping business and technology  data  the volume velocity and variety of data and analytics provide more granular and customized information about not just past patterns and trends but inferences from the big data created by the internet revolution and predictions about the future analytics change how we do work and make decisions predictive analytics have led to prescriptive analytics and have reshaped entire industries as netflix has done in home entertainment  cloud  this is not just a source of greater productivity but the basis for fundamentally new business models information movies highschool term papers etc can now be managed and stored as a service without the need for onpremise servers and licensed applications now people outside the it department can access sophisticated tools and applications on a payasyougo basis this allows for much more flexibility mobility and agility in managing information  social engagement on mobile platforms  individuals are now interacting with institutions in new ways reframing their relationships physical locations matter less than social connections facebooktype technologies inside the enterprise have allowed people to share and build on one anothers ideas data and work products creating a richer dialogue and workspace than ever before and certainly a step change from email and because of the feedback loops created by mobile platforms users have become collaborators any one of these forces would have been enough to usher in a new era of technology together they are redefining the agenda of global business and these technology trends are reshaping hr for example we can now buy hr software and hris as a service on the cloud instead of investing in costly and inflexible onpremise systems we now make peoplerelated decisions and compensation or training investments through advanced analytics rather than standardized processes or benchmarking we now serve up more and more of our programs  from learning to healthcare enrollment  on mobile devices we use social chat features to enhance management development or respond to issues and we find ourselves managing a litany of new business controls to ensure protection of personal and confidential data at the same time these trends are radically reshaping expectations of what hr can and should deliver  both in terms of hr services and in terms of strategic impact what will hr services look like when we focus on user experience in the era of cloud analytics mobile social and security technologies certainly the recruitment function is leading the way with a shift to passive recruiting using google instagram xing europe wechat china weibo china renren china and youtube  as well as through online contests video interviews and integrating the candidate experience on smartphones but while advancements in recruiting offer a glimpse into the future by and large the rest of hr services still feel less like zappos and more like the internal revenue service so how can we modernize our approach i believe there are two main areas that will have a disproportionate influence on the future of our profession  analytics and engagement importance of hr analytics there was a time when hr advice relied heavily on benchmarking we would ask what do mostother successful companies do today with analytics we can mine huge amounts of data and offer more granular customized solutions including more flexible responses using outcome data such as revenues productivity hiring yield individual performance or employee engagement we can help our leaders understand the probability of success of certain decisions for years we have struggled with sales incentives and tried to create norms and rules for how incentives would change peoples behaviors with modern analytics we can define more accurately which incentives work with each employee and for which assignment we can also define the extent to which goals should be stretch versus doable and we can change goals depending on the situation at ibm analytics now enable us to predict an employees propensity to leave in fact several of our hr employees have obtained a us patent for our proactive retention algorithms each year we run proactive retention programs whereby we increase the salaries of employees with a high propensity to leave this program has resulted in net savings of  million with savings measured as the avoided cost of hiring a replacement net of the investment to retain the employees using control groups we have validated the propensity to leave calculation within less than one point of attrition with the availability of social engagement and analytics hr programs have moved from annual events to ongoing works in progress for example at ibm we recently rolled out a recognition program in which  percent of recipients were very satisfied or satisfied our vendor informed us this compared favorably to the industry average of  percent in the first year of implementation  but is this really acceptable we were able to quickly ask those who were not satisfied how we might modify the recognition program to better meet their needs we now have a granular understanding of what kind of recognition has the highest impact on different populations social analytics also give us advance warnings of what might be happening among our employees we monitor blog posts about the company by employees and others while respecting privacy we can gauge positive neutral or negative trends from social media in some emerging markets we have been able to anticipate labor unrest and respond before the external activists interactions resulted in disruptive actions another strategic use of analytics is workforce management whereby headcount management has given way to skills management skills  including depth of skill  have become an important currency in flatter more fluid organizations and there is an increasing need for realtime assessment of skills gaps and redundancies analytics can be used to infer employee expertise from the vast data sources inside companies  blogs publications resumes projects and so on because skills are changing so rapidly in technology skills inventories are hard and complex to keep up to date at ibm we developed an app to find employees with specific expertise anywhere in the world the search returns each experts areas of expertise organizational chart common connections and smartphone contact information this is now being used at an enterprise level for workforce planning such as to identify gaps in hot skills for recruitment and training investments it is also used with inference analytics to match redundant or underemployed employees with job openings and projects that could use their skills hr professionals need to develop analytics capabilities hard as it is to imagine there was a time only  years ago when professionals believed that typing proficiency was not a necessary skill i believe we are now in the same situation with analytics hr professionals have rich data at their fingertips and tools to undertake predictive and prescriptive analytics it wont be long before analytics departments go the way of typing pools hr process to employee experiences and all this is happening at a time when our employees are experiencing a revolution in their consumer experience outside of work with the move to mobile access and social technology employees experience organizations differently than in the past and their bar is much higher their experience on retail platforms has taught them to expect a high level of personalization feedback transparency and adaptation in real time they want all systems to know them they want to participate in the design and improvement of programs that affect them and they want to be able to give feedback or ask questions in the moment and get a response within  minutes newsletter signup benefits hr technology talent management hr leadership inside hr tech hrenow special offers email address privacy policy how do our hr systems and programs do against these expectations for the past two decades hr has been all about process efficiency  standardization outsourcing globalization and manager selfservice  all so hr professionals could focus on more strategic issues the unhappy byproduct of this era is the employee experience while each of our processes   compensation recognition global mobility benefits internal transfers and so on  became more streamlined and more efficient we outsourced the coordination across these silos to the manager and the employee while we may be more efficient than ever before the experience we deliver comes up short compared to what our employees experience every day on retail platforms for example a new employee needs to get a laptop from it a badge from security office space from administrative services benefits and payroll paperwork from compensation onboarding from learning and a welcome from her manager we need to offer employees a customized and integrated onboarding experience including a chance to socialize with other new hires and share questions and answers the same can be said of employee separations which often generate a painfully complex array of disparate tasks for the manager and this brings us to the real potential of combining analytics and employee experience we will be able to anticipate what employees may need using agile methods hr professionals will operate less as subjectmatter experts and more as custodians of the employee and manager experience no matter how you come at this the answer isnt to extend existing hr practices its completely reimagining how our work is done how processes run and how we integrate the core of the enterprise with the capabilities of individual professionals when we do these things in hr we can create a workplace that is more effective for our people and one where they feel like they matter  and have a say in the things that matter to them i am an optimist about the future of our profession for years or even decades hr has sought to make an impact technological advances are once again enabling hr to shift to higher ground just as we shifted from personnel to human resources years ago today its about how we capture the incredible wealth of data and insight about talent that will shape a companys future talent is the center of everything we do to compete in new industries we have to create an environment that builds talent  with people who can learn adapt lead and innovate in a workplace that is interactive and transparent hr with a focus on analytics and employee engagement becomes the transformative force to shape the future of the enterprise diane gherson is senior vice president of human resources at ibm a role she has held since  send questions or comments about this feature to hreletterslrpcom selected essays from the rise of hr effective hr professionals have unique opportunities to add enormous value to business success through insights on talent leadership and organization to comprehend and create hrs future the hr certification institute in washington used the wisdom of crowds logic and invited hr thought leaders to share their answers to a relatively simple question what do hr professionals need to know or do to be effective in todays and tomorrows business world the result of this quest is an unprecedented book edited by dave ulrich william schiemann and libby sartain the rise of hr in which  hr thought leaders from industry academia consulting associations and government put aside commercial and competitive interests to offer global collaborative and innovate
