advertising and microtransactions these microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase ingame booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels additional lives and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days in june  the company opted to remove all ingame advertising from their games relying solely on microtransactions the company stated that due to their focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of kings overall strategy advertising revenue had only made up  of the companys earnings in  and only  within  the company in its ipo files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue while king relies heavily on ingame purchases it is estimated that only singledigit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles in q  king had  million monthly unique users with  million of them spending money the  that pay spent an average of  a month within the games king stated that their model is aimed to continue

primarily through games developed by zynga kingcom saw a significant drop in players on their portal games as a result and started to develop their own facebookbased games using the games already developed on the kingcom portal with their first such game released in  kingcom used their web portal as a testing grounds for new game ideas and determine which ones to bring to facebook as well as determining how to implement various microtransactions for tournamentstyle play into the facebook games their first crossplatform web portalfacebook game miner speed which allowed sharing of player information between platforms was released in  and was a simple match tile game inspired by bejeweled following this model in october  the company released bubble witch saga to both platforms bubble witch saga introduced the nature of a saga game that instead of playing the same gameboard for as long as the player could continue to match matches that instead the game offered individual levels that would challenge the player to complete certain goals in a limited number of turns these saga elements allowed for the basics of social gameplay but did not require the time investment that thenpopular titles like zyngas farmville required players could play just for a few minutes each day through the saga model the formula proved extremely successful and january  bubble witch saga had over  million players and was one of the mostplayed facebook games by april  kingcom had the second largest player count around  million unique users second only to zynga on the facebook platform facebooks director of games partnerships sean ryan described kingcoms growth on the platform as they were not a flash in the pan  theyve been around seven years but they came out of no where in an area that was unexpected kingcom next released candy crush saga in april  based on the popularity of its candy crush webportal game and following the saga model from bubble witch saga the game attracted more than  million players within a few weeks the popularity of bubble witch saga and candy crush saga led kingcom to start a new strategy into developing for the growing mobile game market in a manner that would allow players to synchronize with the facebook platform zacconi said that as consumers and the industry focus more on games for mobile devices launching a truly crossplatform facebook game has been a top priority for kingcom a mobile version for ios device of bubble witch saga was released in july  while the ios mobile version of candy crush saga was released in october  both games saw boosts in the number of unique players with the mobile introduction kingcom saw that previouslydeclining player counts for bubble witch saga become steady with the mobile versions

operating officer thomas hartwig – chief technology officer colin daly – chief people officer revenue modeledit kings games prior to june  made revenue for the company through a combination of ingame advertising and microtransactions these microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase ingame booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels additional lives and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days in june  the company opted to remove all ingame advertising from their games relying solely on microtransactions the company stated that due to their focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of kings overall strategy advertising revenue had only made up  of the companys earnings in  and only  within  the company in its ipo files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue while king relies heavily on ingame purchases it is estimated that only singledigit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles in q  king had  million monthly unique users with  million of them spending money the  that pay spent an average of  a month within the games king stated that their model is aimed to continue to draw existing and new players to all of their games if the cost to acquire players is greater than the revenue we generate over time from those players and if we cannot successfully migrate our current players to new games and new platforms as we have historically done so our business and operating results will be harmed gamesedit king games offer synchronized play enabling users to connect
