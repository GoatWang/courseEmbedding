similar or better investment options without interruption and at no additional cost to them contract owners with subaccount balances invested through the accounts in shares of the replacement funds will have the same or lower total expense ratios taking into account fund expenses including rule b fees if any with respect to all of the proposed substitutions the combined management fee and rule b fees paid by the replacement fund are the same or lower than those of the corresponding existing fund the application sets forth the fees and expenses of each existing fund and its corresponding replacement fund in greater detail  applicants represent that as of the effective date of the substitutions “effective date” shares of the existing funds will be redeemed for cash the companies on behalf of each existing fund subaccount of each relevant account will simultaneously place a redemption request with each existing fund and a purchase order with the corresponding replacement fund so that the purchase of replacement fund shares will be for the exact amount of the redemption proceeds thus contract values will remain fully invested at all times  the substitutions will take place at relative net asset value in accordance with rule c under the  act with no change in the amount of any affected contract owners contract value cash value accumulation value account value or death benefit or in dollar value of his or her investment in the applicable accounts no brokerage commissions or other fees will be paid by either the existing funds or the replacement funds or by the affected contract owners in connection with the substitutions  the affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the substitutions nor will their rights or the companies obligations under the contracts be altered in any way the companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses the substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by affected contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the substitutions moreover the substitutions will not impose any tax liability on affected contract owners  as described in the application after notification of the substitution and for  days after the effective date affected contract owners may reallocate the subaccount value of an existing fund to any other investment option available under their contract without incurring any transfer chargesstart printed page   all contract owners affected by the substitutions will be notified of this application by means of supplements to the contract prospectuses at least  days prior to the effective date the notice will advise contract owners that from the date of the notice until the effective date owners are permitted to make one transfer of contract value out of the existing fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge among other information the notice will inform affected contract owners that the companies will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the effective date  if affected contract owners reallocate account value during this  day period there will be no charge for the reallocation of accumulated value from the existing fund subaccounts and the reallocation will

confirmation that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified a restatement of the information set forth in the presubstitution notice and values of the contract owners position in the existing fund before the substitution and the replacement fund after the substitution applicants legal analysis  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the substitutions section c requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust section c requires the commission to issue such an order if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  applicants submit that the terms and conditions of the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and assert that the replacement of an existing fund with the corresponding replacement fund is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act as described in the application for a period of two years following the effective date the companies or their affiliates will reimburse any contract owner affected by the proposed substitutions involving transamerica series trust replacement funds and whose subaccount invests in the replacement fund to the extent a replacement funds net annual operating expenses exceeds the net annual operating expenses of the corresponding existing fund applicants further assert that each replacement fund has similar investment objectives and investment strategies as the corresponding existing fund or each replacement funds underlying portfolio construction and investment results are similar to those of the corresponding existing fund accordingly applicants believe that the fundamental investment objectives risk and performance expectations of the contract owners will continue to be met after the substitutions  applicants also maintain that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for its corresponding existing fund applicants anticipate that the substitution of an existing fund with the corresponding replacement fund will result in a contract that is administered and managed more efficiently and one that is more competitive with other variable products the rights of affected contract owners and the obligations of the companies under the contracts will not be altered by the substitutions affected contract owners will not incur any additional tax liability or any additional fees and expenses as a result of the substitutions  each of the prospectuses for the contracts discloses that the issuing company reserves the right subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another registered openend management investment company for shares of an openend management investment company held by a subaccount of an account  applicants also assert that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike a traditional unit investment trust where a depositor could only substitute an investment security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer account values into other subaccounts moreover the contracts will offer affected contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts into any of the remaining subaccounts without cost or other disadvantage the substitution therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemptions that section c was designed to prevent applicants also maintain that the substitutions are unlike the type of substitutions which section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract contract owners select much more than a particular registered management openend investment company in which to invest their account values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the companies under their contracts as well as other rights and privileges set forth in the contracts applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the proposed substitutions will not be effected unless the companies determine that a the contracts allow the substitution of shares of

will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the contract owners to effect the substitutions  the proposed substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  the proposed substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for affected contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the rights or obligations of the companies under the contracts of start printed page affected contract owners will not be altered in any way  affected contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in the existing fund before the effective date or the replacement fund after the effective date to any other available investment option under the contract without charge for a period beginning at least  days before the effective date through at least  days following the effective date except as described in any market timingshortterm trading provisions of the relevant prospectus the company will not exercise any right it may have under the contract to impose restrictions on

below the limit any adjustments will be made at least on a quarterly basis in addition the companies will not increase the contract fees and charges including asset based charges such as mortality expense risk charges deducted from the subaccounts that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the contracts for a period of at least two years following the effective date start signature for

transamerica series trust changed its name from aegontransamerica series trust back to citation   applicants state that because the substitutions will occur at relative net asset value and the fees and charges under the contracts will not change as a result of the substitutions the benefits offered by the guarantees under the contracts will be the same immediately before and after the substitutions applicants also state that what effect the substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the contract guarantees would depend among other things on the relative future performance of the existing funds and replacement funds which applicants cannot predict nevertheless applicants note that at the time of the substitutions the contracts will offer a comparable variety
