ordinary doctor can be with watson as an assistant first even before the patient enters the room it can analyze their personal medical history which often runs to hundreds of pages then it can compare the case history with the  academic papers published every year as well as potentially millions of other patient records all of this is of course beyond the capabilities of human doctors who typically only get a few minutes to prepare for each examination so being able to consult with watson will be enormously helpful the real value is offering watson as a service by providing its api so that

of truth in it i wanted to check with a former madd volunteer but the email address wobbled and then fell against a light pole the title was arresting “ibm watson bottles ‘holiday spirit’ with new rum created using artificial intelligence” the source the “real” news outfit the uk mirror the write up explained that watson allegedly “produces beverage based on social media posts” i learned “holiday spirit” is claimed to be the world’s very first datadistilled rum and was created using ibm watson the supercomputer analyzed data from social media posts in order to produce a bespoke rum “that tastes like a holiday” “in just six hours watson was able to read  million posts on facebook instagram and twitter relating to holidays – and find the predominant emotions and concepts in those posts” explained joe harrods big data analyst and ai expert who works closely with watson the idea was that watson guzzled  rum reviews then watson demonstrated that it was in control of its faculties by “matching emotions from the reviews with ingredients” finally walked a straight line to a master blender who concocted liquor hooch booze or nectar that has a subtle vanilla flavor medium sweetness hints of coconut and is naturally caressed with cinnamon and allspice so what here’s the results of the breathalyzer test “there’s no reason that this ‘taste sensation’ couldn’t be recreated for all kinds of experiences and emotions we’ve already seen robot bartenders that can mix custom cocktails for every different punter based on their personality… i am delighted that i have never had a drink of alcohol i wonder if the same might be said of watson or possibly the marketer who blended this knock out punch for artificial intelligence what was that question oh right i remember “watson when

revenue january   to ibm’s credit since the “weather” changed ibm’s watson marketing has been less fun for me i did enjoy reading “elementary my dear ibm when will watson make money” i prefer the concept of substantial sustainable revenue which generates profits for stakeholders but the write up’s title is pretty good after asking this important question the write up states ibm watson has taken heat from wall street for not adding to big blue’s revenue as the company reported a th successive quarter of decline that’s quite a track record nineteen of anything in a row is difficult to pull off way to go ibm i highlighted this passage as well but quizzing executives following ibm’s financial report on the fourth quarter of  morgan stanley’s katy huberty noted that although watson was getting a “pretty significant share of the press” – to put it mildly – unlike the other businesses that it was cited alongside watson was “not contributing to revenue” huberty probed when watson would start bringing in money ibm admitted to shaving spent a combined bn on rd and acquisitions during  including buying  companies such as the bn acquisition of truven health analytics i put a big blue exclamation point next to this passage ibm’s cfo commented about watson’s payoff this way revenue would come through watson serving ibm’s strategic imperatives and cognitive software watson is the “silver thread” running though watson health and financial services ibm’s iot and security he said “watson is firmly firmly established as the silver thread that runs through those cognitive

watson marketing i get a kick out of the firm’s saga of declining quarterly revenue will ibm make it  quarters in a row i am breathless i read “ibm’s rometty lays out ai considerations ethical principals” the main idea as i understand it is artificial intelligence should be used to advance and augment humans not replace them transparency of ai development is also necessary since smart software is dependent upon numerical recipes i am not sure that the many outfits involved in fiddling with procedures systems and methods are going to make clear what their wizards are doing furthermore ibm in my opinion is a bit of a buggy whip outfit the idea that a buggy whip can control a bright  year old monitoring a drone swarm relying on artificial intelligence to complete a mission maybe ibm will equip watson with telepathy the write up explains commonly referred to as artificial intelligence this new generation of technology and the cognitive systems it helps power will soon touch every facet of work and life – with the potential to radically transform them for the better…as with every prior worldchanging technology this technology carries major implications many of the questions it raises are unanswerable today and will require time research and open discussion to answer okay what’s deepmind up to what about those folks at facebook baidu microsoft mit and most of the upscale french universities doing are the insights of researchers in beijing finding their way into the media channel well ibm is going to take action if the information in the “real” journalistic write up is on the money here’s what big blue is going to do in its continuing effort to become a plus for stakeholders ibm’s systems will augment human intelligence sounds good but the direction of some smart software is to make it easy for humans to get a pizza the digital divide delivers convenience to lots of folks and big paydays to those in the top tier who find a way to sell stuff alexa i need paper towels transparency right that’s a great idea but how it plays out in the real world is going to be a bit hit and miss actually more miss than hit the big money folks want to move to “winner take all” plays amazon alexa has partners amazon keeps some money as it continues it march to global digital walmartism skills yep the smart software movers and shakers buy promising outfits even the allegedly independent folks in montréal are finding microsoft a pretty nifty place to work perhaps the folks doing smart software will meet and agree on some rules better yet the us government can legislate rules and then rely on the united nations or ngos to promulgate them wait there is a better way why not use a vulcan mind meld i understand the ibm has to take the high road

“earned a total of  us patents last year at a rate of  patents per day…” impressive i checked ibm’s financial performance and verified that the company has reported its th consecutive quarter of

planet bob stasio hosts the podcast we found what one of the guests tyler carbone had to say quite interesting the parts of the internet we’re particularly interested in is where stolen information is posted and traded what’s interesting is that that’s happening not through tor…for what we’re interested in a lot of stolen information is posted traded and sold on lite web sites — you can access them in internet explorer or chrome they’re just hosted in countries that aren’t particularly listed one of the most wellknown carding marketplaces…is hosted on a cm…that’s not hidden within tor at all the problem is that individuals are logging in in an anonymous way so we can’t follow up with the individuals the line between the surface web and the dark web may be blurring or blurred ultimately the internet is rooted in connection so it’s hard to imagine clear separation between actors and activities being relegated to one or the other we recommend giving this podcast a listen to ruminate on

changers artificial intelligence like ibm watson superhero vision via “hyperimaging” macroscopes medical labs on a chip smart sensors what i found interesting was this comment from the nutritionist

virtual machine the atm machine magnetic stripe cards and the universal bar code their employees have won five nobel prizes six turing awards ten national medals of technology and five national medals

arnold  beyond search beyond search home about writers landscape wizards index honk   subscribe browse  home  ibm watson news  ibm watson predicting the future ibm watson predicting the future july   i enjoy ibm’s visions of the future one exception the company’s revenue estimates for the watson product line is an exception i read “ibm declares ai the key to making unstructured data useful” for me the “facts” in the write up are a bit like a payday candy bar some nuts squished into a squishy core of questionable nutritional value i noted this factoid  percent of company data is unstructured including freeform documents images and voice recordings i have been interested in the application of the  rule to certain types of estimates the problem is that the ‘principle of factor sparsity” gets disconnected from the underlying data generalizations are just so darned fun and easy the problem is that the mathematical rigor necessary to validate the generalization is just too darned much work the “hey i’ve got a meeting” or the more common “i need to check my mobile” get in the way of figuring out if the  statement makes sense my admittedly inept encounters with data suggest that the volume of unstructured data is high higher that the  percent in the rule the problem is that today’s systems struggle to make sense of massive streams of unstructured data from outfits like youtube clear text and encrypted text messages and the information blasted about on social media identify the important items of content directly germane to a particular matter figure out how to convert content processing into useful elements like named entities and relate those entities to code words and synonyms perform cost effective indexing of content streams in near real time at this time systems designed to extract actionable information from relatively small chunks of content are improving but these systems typically break down when the volume exceeds the budget and computing resources available to those trying to “make sense” of the data in a finite amount of time this type of problem is difficult due to constraints on the systems these constraints are financial as in “who has the money available right now to process these streams” these constraints are problematic when someone asks “what do we do with the data in this dialect from northern afghanistan” and there are other questions my problem with the ibm approach is that the realities of volume interrelating structured and semi structured data and multi lingual content is that these bumps in the information super highway watson seems to speed along are absorbed by marketing fluffiness i loved this passage chatterjee highlighted macy’s as an example of an ibm customer that’s using the company’s tools to better personalize customers’ shopping experiences using ai the macy’s on call feature lets customers get information about what’s in stock and other key details about the contents of a retail store without a human sales associate present it uses watson’s natural language understanding capabilities to process user queries and provide answers right now that feature is available as part of a pilot in  macy’s stores yep i bet that macy’s is going to hit a home run against the fast ball pitching of jeff bezos’ amazon prime team let’s ask watson on the other hand let’s ask alexa stephen e arnold
