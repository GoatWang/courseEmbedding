waters and in mineral deposits of certain springs and lake brines the richest and most commonly found source of soda ash is trona a mix of sodium carbonate sodium bicarbonate and water although trona can be found in many places the world’s purest largest and most accessible deposit is in wyoming’s green river basin a leading global producer of natural soda ash at ciner wyoming’s  million ton

industries and applications including glass manufacturing dry powder detergents eg laundry auto dish etc pulp processing ph control specialty chemicals manufacturing eg phosphates chromium etc food manufacturing eg yeast baking soda etc history of soda ash about  million years ago volcanic activity decaying plant matter and climate change caused the evaporation of a large lake leaving behind the world’s largest trona deposit located in green river wyoming ancient egyptians dug up dry lakebed deposits using soda ash to make glass ornaments and vessels romans used soda ash for baking bread making glass and medicinal purposes soda ash has been used in manufacturing for over  years up until the th century soda ash was extracted from the ashes of plants that grew in sodium rich soil the method was so common it is how the powder received the name ‘soda ash’ now mined from trona deposits soda ash is one of the world’s most abundant natural resources soda ash is one of the most widely used and important commodities in the us how is soda ash used when processed soda ash can vary in density size and shape this flexibility allows it to be used in a variety of everyday products from bathtubs and baked goods to office building windows and internet cables some common examples are listed below natural vs synthetic synthetic soda ash is made using either the solvay or hou process and contains a number of different chemicals both methods leave behind byproducts and require either seaside discharge or waste beds to catch leftover impurities these impurities have led to water pollution and overall deterioration of the surrounding environment unlike the synthetic solvay and hou processes ciner uses an allnatural mining system our soda ash is mined from the ground and refined with no additional chemicals the ciner method is environmentally friendly and produces a pure highquality product our allnatural approach keeps costs low allowing us to distribute ciner soda ash all over the world in a costeffective and competitive manner bulk soda ash we recommend epoxylined steel storage bins if the granular nature of the ash is intact after conveying and elevating there should be no problems with the material bridging or hanging up in storage ensuring the cone at the bottom is at a  degree angle from the horizontal is strongly advised storage bin capacity should be figured at  lb per cubic foot although ciner soda ash normally runs closer to  lb per cubic foot if the storage bin is designed with a sufficient bottom slope vibration should not be necessary what’s more vibration is undesirable as it promotes segregation and classification of the particle sizes soda ash solution these solutions are generally stored in a tank soda ash is inversely soluble above °f that is as the temperature falls more material goes into the solution solubility reaches a maximum of  soda ash by weight at this inflection point °f and then falls steeply with decreasing temperature since the presence of soda ash crystals is unacceptable in most processes the concentration of a substantial amount of solution will require an excessive tankage volume example adding  tons of soda ash to water to make a  solution by weight requires about  gallons of tankage soda ash slurry an alternative to large volume tankage is a slurry storage system that consists of a tank a device for slurrying the dry bulk soda ash and transferring it to the storage tank slurrifier and a method for reclaiming the solution from the common tank to slurry a ton hopper car of soda ash to a  solids slurry requires a tank about the same size as dry bulk storage slurries of up to  solids are easily stored bagged soda ash bagged soda ash that is stored in a warehouse environment free from excessive humidity or moisture should present no problems however if proper inventory management practices such as “fifo” first in first out are not applied or the product is exposed to high levels of humidity or moisture some caking of material is possible safety precautions for soda ash handling although not listed as a hazardous substance soda ash is primarily a skin irritant dusts or mists containing soda ash are moderately irritating to the mucous membranes of the nose and eyes the irritation is temporary however and symptoms usually disappear shortly after contact ends eyes and skin should be flushed with water if exposed a physician should treat prolonged irritation protective clothing goggles and respirators should be used if soda ash in the air exceeds nuisance dust levels dusty clothing should be washed before exposure to other compounds in extreme cases mixtures of soda ash and lime may produce caustic soda in the presence of perspiration which may be irritating workers in soda ash storage bins or soda ash silos should wear a properly roped safety belt to facilitate rescue in case of shifts or slides they also should maintain continuous communication with someone stationed outside the storage facility soda ash is nonexplosive nonflammable and is not regulated for shipping by the us department of transportation due to its nonhazardous status complete health and safety information is contained in our soda ash safety data sheets sds note all statements information and data given herein are believed to be accurate and

humidity or is allowed to get wet it will react with moisture and can become chunky for additional information on safety and handling please refer to our soda ash safety data sheetssds other important conveyance information when discharging soda ash from a hopper car it’s a good idea to provide canvas sleeve adapters between the car’s discharge gates and the hopper under the track this will help provide a constant feed into the hopper and make for a cleaner discharging process selecting the correct conveyance method is critical to proper soda ash handling for example when designing a system for unloading bulk soda ash from bottomdump hopper cars it’s important to first determine whether or not the soda ash must be protected during conveyance ciner soda ash is granular freeflowing and relatively dustless if it is carried by conveyor systems that abrade the product its granular nature may be altered this could result in adverse product performance in certain applications and create dust problems during handling and storage terminal locations buffalo new york rail to truck transfer ciner coordinates and manages the transportation of our soda ash products to our

resources mlp cinr is a limited partnership that owns a  stake in a trona mine in wyoming trona is the raw material that is processed into soda ash cinr recently reported on by double dividend is one of five us companies that mine trona cinr appears to have about  of the us market and roughly  to  of the world market for soda ash market data based on mineral commodity summaries produced by the us geological survey cinr data are from the k available on the cinr web site and from morningstar accessed through a proprietary internet database thanks to double dividend for their very detailed report pointing to this highyield opportunity this report will address some of the issues raised by double dividend and the responses to their report organizationownership structure the capital structure of a limited partnership is different from but analogous to a corporate structure partnership profits are taxed at the partner level reported to the partners along with other various deductions that passthrough to the partners on forms k so the lp entity does not pay or provide for income taxes ciner resources lp the operating company under discussion has two classes of limited partnership interest units common and subordinated which participate equally in per unit distributions after the floor distribution amount of  per unit is reached thus far in the life of the lp the  floor has been equaled or exceeded every quarter and the two classes have received equal distributions the socalled common lp units which have voting rights are owned approximately  by the public the remainder of the common units and all of the subordinated units which do not vote and the general partner  interest are all owned by various entities owned or controlled by turgay ciner a turkish national ciner resources lp holds a  interest in ciner wyoming llc which leases the ciner mining rights in sweetwater county wyoming in effect the public limited partner owners common unit holders own what can be thought of as tantamount to a ½ working interest in the ciner sweetwater wyoming aka the green river basin leases the lp owns  of the mining rights after the general partners  interest thus the common units own ½ of  of  of the mining rights and the public own ¼ of the common units ¼ x ½ x  x    risks ansac american natural soda ash corporation one of largest ciners competitors is also their largest customer accounting for over  of their soda ash sales ansac is a cooperative operated for the benefit of three of the five major us soda ash producers including cinr which controls cinrs international sales outside of canada and the european union this arrangement could be construed as potentially violating various domestic and international antitrust statutes presenting at the least a significant litigation risk the trona deposits in wyoming represent over  of the worlds supply of trona the trona mines in wyoming are leased from the us government and others on longterm leases requiring royalty payments as product is mined royalty payments are made to the us bureau of land management the state of wyoming and rock springs royalty company a local royalty owner leases with rock springs royalty do not expire on their face leases with the blm generally have  year terms with current leases expiring at various times from  through  cinr has preferential renewal rights with blm there is no contractual right to renew the state of wyoming leases all the leases began in the s and have been renewed numerous times cinr estimates their leases cover proven reserves that at current production levels would supply trona for  years the mining method used by cinr is underground pillar and room mining they use large machines to extract the raw trona from strips or veins a few hundred feet underground when it is brought to the surface it processed in the refinery in a nutshell the process of refining involves crushing the trona ore and dissolving it in water at about ° fahrenheit the water is then filtered and evaporated leaving the soda ash or the slurry can be centrifuged to separate the precipitate soda ash calcium carbonate and other alkali products residue which is then loaded on rail cars for shipment to customers other mining methods and other refining methods may appear which could put cinr at a competitive disadvantage cinr operates from a single mining and refining facility presenting a geographic concentration of risk related to potential natural disasters such as earthquake flood and manmade disasters such as fire and explosion and so on additionally cinr sells a single product subjecting investors to substantial exposure to obsolescence or technological change that could reduce the utility of the product advantages according to isonex chemical engineering consultants the cost to build a new soda ash refinery could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars thus there is a steep bar to entry into the business limiting the growth in number of competitors cinr produces natural soda ash by processing trona their processes are simple and do not appear to release significant environmentally hazardous materials their costs give cinr a competitive advantage of producers of synthetic soda ash synthetic soda ash is produced by chemical processes from limestone and salt but the process is significantly more expensive than processing soda ash from natural trona and it results in the production of some environmental wastes cinr management estimates their trona refining process costs  to  less per ton than the cost to produce a ton of synthetic soda ash growth potential although ciner resources lp is new the underlying assets in the hands of the previous owners have produced trona and refined and sold soda ash for over  years for the last three years cinrs shares of the us and world markets for refined soda ash have remained steady at  and  respectively over the  years ending in  world soda ash sales grew at a steady average rate of  the average price per long ton gradually increased about  per annum over the last  years but in the most recent three that price inflation rate appears to have slowed to about  management believes that by reprocessing reclaimed briny waste water from the refining process deca rehydration they can reduce waste material and marginally increase production cinr appears to be able to sell all they can make and refine and opportunities for significant expansion of production appear limited given these factors annual sales can be expected to approach  million by  profitability income statements for the last six years through  and including income statements from the predecessor entity show the company averaged a  return on sales improving to  average return on sales for the last two years given the forecast growth in world soda ash production and cinrs market share cinr sales for  can be estimated at about  million and with indicated distributable net income in the range of  and  million per year during the five years including  at similar levels of income cinr throws off about  million cash from operating activities and free cash flow operating cash less capital expenditures available for financing activities such as debt reduction and distributions to unit holders of about  million per year given the number of common and subordinated units issued and outstanding and the units held by the general partner free cash of about  million per year is required to maintain the distribution payments at the current levels of about  per unit so the distribution at the  level seems safe conclusions is cinr too good to be true perhaps ciner resources lp nysecinr represents a minority interest in a major player in the capital intensive extractive mining and refining alkali industry providing basic materials to manufacturers and other users of soda ash risks analogous to real estate investments in single tenant buildings arise from the single product single location nature of the business from the small number of competitors and the significance of ansac as a dominant customer the general economic risks from investing subject to basic commodity price fluctuations and world economic activity levels also are significant but understandable operations are profitable and the current distribution level appears safe for the longterm holder growth prospects are limited as are opportunities for significant change in profitability levels so the shares are not expected to appreciate significantly in the next five or so years with

our  outlook the capital investments we have been making enabled us to increase our sales volume  for the year helping to offset the impact from lower global soda ash prices fourth quarter results were adversely impacted by a number of unique operational issues that drove production levels well below our expectations extreme weather conditions led to lower onstream time for our production units and we lost a significant amount of ore production for a day period due to temporary operational modifications we were required to make by msha looking into  weve made good strides to lower our cost of goods sold and improve the efficiency and productivity of our green river operations both of those should more than offset the headwinds we will experience from lower net prices in north and south america we also have encouraging signs of market strength in asia and anticipate higher prices at least through the first half of the year  outlook we expect our soda ash total volume sold to increase

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we also present the nongaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus net interest expense income tax depreciation depletion and amortization and certain other expenses that are noncash charges or that we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations distributable cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda less net cash paid for interest maintenance capital expenditures and income taxes each as attributable to ciner resources lp distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances we define distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of distributable cash flow as of the end of the period to cash distributions payable with respect to such period adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are nongaap supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in our industry without regard to historical cost basis or in the case of adjusted ebitda financing methods the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities our nongaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio should not be considered as alternatives to gaap net income operating income net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities investors should not consider adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may be defined differently by other companies including those in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility the table below presents a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow to the
