financial stocks in global developed markets outside north america that offer economic value utilizing the croci® strategy as one factor among other factors under the croci® strategy economic value is measured using various metrics such as the croci® economic price earnings ratio this ratio is a proprietary measure of company valuation using the same relationships between valuation and return as an accounting pe ratio ie price book value divided by return on equity croci® is a proprietary valuation methodology which dates back to  when it was developed by deutsche bank and attempts to understand the real value of a company portfolio management has the discretion from time to time to utilize forward foreign currency contracts to hedge against changes in value of the non−us currency exposure of the fund’s investments the amount of the hedge if any is within management’s discretion depending on its outlook for currency marketsthe fund will be managed using the croci® investment process which is based on portfolio management’s belief that over time stocks which display more favorable financial metrics for example the croci® economic pe ratio as generated by this process may outperform stocks which display less favorable metrics this premise may not prove to be correct and prospective investors should evaluate this assumption prior to investing in the fund the fund’s use of forward currency contracts may not be successful in hedging currency exchange rates changes and could eliminate some or all of the benefit of an increase in the value of a foreign currency versus the us

global growth funds the fund invests at least  of its total assets in us and foreign equities equities issued by us and foreignbased companies most of the funds equities are common stocks although the fund can invest in companies of any size and from any country it generally focuses on established companies in countries with developed economies the fund does not invest in securities issued by tobaccoproducing companies in choosing stocks the portfolio managers use a combination of three analytical disciplines bottomup research the managers look for companies that are industry leaders have strong finances and management and appear able to make the most of local regional and global opportunities growth orientation the managers primarily invest in companies that offer the potential for sustainable aboveaverage earnings growth and whose market value appears reasonable in light of their business prospects analysis of global themes the managers consider global economic outlooks seeking to identify industries and companies that are likely to benefit from social political and economic changes the managers intend to keep the funds holdings diversified across industries and geographical areas although depending on their outlook they may increase or reduce the funds exposure to a given industry or area  other investments although the fund is permitted to use various types of

pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the managers use analytical tools to actively monitor the risk profile of the portfolio as compared to comparable funds and appropriate benchmarks and peer groups the managers use several strategies in seeking to reduce downside risk including i diversifying broadly among companies industries countries and regions ii focusing on high quality companies with reasonable valuations and iii generally focusing on countries with developed economies the fund will normally sell a stock when the managers believe its price is unlikely to go much higher its fundamentals have deteriorated other investments offer better opportunities or in the course of adjusting the funds emphasis on a given country the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or make the fund perform less well than other investments as with most stock funds the most important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform both in the us and abroad when stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well foreign stocks tend to be more volatile than their us counterparts for reasons ranging from political and economic uncertainties to a higher risk that essential information may be incomplete or wrong these risks tend to be greater in emerging markets so to the extent that the fund invests in emerging markets such as latin america and most pacific basin countries it takes on greater risks because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies a second major factor is currency exchange rates when the dollar value of a foreign currency falls so does the value of any investments the fund owns that are denominated in that currency this is separate from market risk and may add to market losses or reduce market gains the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs this fund is designed for longterm investors interested in a broadly diversified approach to global investing  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th other factors that could affect performance include o the managers could be wrong in their analysis of companies sectors economic trends the relative attractiveness of different sizes of stocks or other matters o derivatives could produce disproportionate losses o the funds risk management strategies could make longterm performance

particularly when there appears to be a pattern of market timing or other frequent purchases and sales we may also reject or limit purchase orders for these or other reasons when you want to sell more than  worth of shares youll usually need to place your order in writing and include a signature guarantee the only exception is if you want money wired to a bank account that is already on file with us in that case you dont need a signature guarantee also you dont need a signature guarantee for an exchange although we may require one in certain other circumstances a signature guarantee is simply a certification of your signature  a valuable safeguard against fraud you can get a signature guarantee from most brokers banks savings institutions and credit unions note that you cant get a signature guarantee from a notary public when you sell shares that have a cdsc we calculate the cdsc as a percentage of what you paid for the shares or what you are selling them for  whichever results in the lowest charge to you in processing orders to sell shares we turn to the shares with the lowest cdsc first exchanges from one fund into another dont affect cdscs for each investment you make the

shares is also the nav although for class b and class c investors a cdsc may be taken out of the proceeds see choosing a share class we typically use market prices to value securities however when a market price isnt available or when we have reason to believe it doesnt represent market realities we may use fair value methods approved by a funds board in such a case a funds value for a security is likely to be different from the last quoted market prices to the extent that a fund invests in securities that are traded primarily in foreign markets the value of its holdings could change at a time when you arent able to buy or sell fund shares this is because some foreign markets are open on days or at times when a fund doesnt price its shares  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st

provide a correct social security or other tax id number if the account has already been opened we may give you  days notice to provide the correct number o charge you  each calendar quarter if your account balance is below  for the entire quarter this policy doesnt apply to most retirement accounts or if you have an automatic investment plan or in any case where a fall in share price created the

in us and foreign equities equities issued by us and foreignbased companies most of the funds equities are common stocks although the fund can invest in companies of any size and from any country it generally focuses on established companies in countries with developed economies the fund does not invest in securities issued by tobaccoproducing companies in choosing stocks the portfolio managers

local regional and global opportunities growth orientation the managers primarily invest in companies that offer the potential for sustainable aboveaverage earnings growth and whose market value appears reasonable in light of their business prospects analysis of global themes the managers consider global economic outlooks seeking to identify industries and companies that are likely to benefit

developed economies the fund will normally sell a stock when the managers believe its price is unlikely to go much higher its fundamentals have deteriorated other investments offer better opportunities or in the course of adjusting the funds emphasis on a given country the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or make the fund perform less well than other investments as with most stock funds the most important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform both in the us and abroad when stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well foreign stocks tend to be more volatile than their us counterparts for reasons ranging from political and economic uncertainties to a higher risk that essential information may be incomplete or wrong these risks tend to be greater in emerging markets so to the extent that the fund invests in emerging markets such as latin america and most pacific basin countries it takes on greater risks because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies a second major factor is currency exchange rates when the dollar value of a foreign currency falls so does the value of any investments the fund owns that are denominated in that currency this is separate from market risk and may add to market losses or reduce market gains the following sidebar text appears

share class of each fund uses the following equation total assets  total liabilities   nav total number of shares outstanding we typically use market prices to value securities however when a market price isnt available or when we have reason to believe it doesnt represent market realities we may use fair value methods approved by a funds board in such a case the funds value for a security is likely to be different from the last quoted market prices the price at which you sell shares of each fund is also that funds nav minus a  redemptionexchange fee on class s shares of scudder

accounts may also be eligible for this waiver if your employersponsored retirement plan is through a thirdparty investment provider or if you are investing through an ira or other individual retirement account the fee will apply to the extent that a fund invests in securities that are traded primarily in foreign markets the value of their holdings could change at a time when you arent

we will give you  days notice  days for retirement accounts so you can either increase your balance or close your account these policies dont apply to investors with  or more in scudder fund shares or

opened we may give you  days notice to provide the correct number o pay you for shares you sell by redeeming in kind that is by giving you marketable securities which typically will involve brokerage costs for you to liquidate rather than cash the funds generally wont make a redemption in kind unless your requests over a day period total more than  or  of the value of the funds net assets

december and if necessary may do so at other times as well you can choose how to receive your dividends and distributions you can have them all automatically reinvested in fund shares all deposited directly to your bank account or all sent to you by check have one type reinvested and the other sent to you by check or have them invested in a different fund tell us your preference on your application if you dont indicate a preference your dividends and distributions will all be reinvested for retirement plans reinvestment is the only option buying and selling fund shares will usually

the funds main investment strategy the fund seeks longterm growth of capital by investing at least  of its total assets in foreign equities equities issued by foreignbased companies and listed on foreign exchanges although the fund can invest in companies of any size and from any country it invests mainly in common stocks of established companies in countries with developed economies other than the united states in choosing common stocks the portfolio managers use a combination of three analytical disciplines bottomup research the managers look for individual companies that have financial strength good business prospects competitive positioning and earnings growth that is aboveaverage for their market segment among other factors topdown analysis the managers consider the economic outlooks for various countries and geographical regions favoring countries that they believe have sound economic conditions and open markets analysis of global themes the managers look for significant changes in the business environment seeking to identify industries that may benefit from these changes the managers intend to divide the funds holdings across industries and geographical areas although depending on their outlook they may increase or reduce the funds exposure to a given industry or area  other investments the fund may invest up to  of net assets in foreign debt securities including convertible bonds although the fund is permitted to use various types of derivatives contracts whose value is based on for example indices commodities currencies or securities the managers dont intend to use them as principal investments and may not use them at all  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd the fund will normally sell a stock when the managers believe its price is unlikely to go much higher its fundamentals have deteriorated other investments offer better opportunities or in the course of adjusting the funds emphasis on a given country the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or make the fund perform less well than other investments as with most stock funds the most important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform  in this case foreign markets when foreign stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well foreign stocks also tend to be more volatile than their us counterparts for reasons ranging from political and economic uncertainties to a higher risk that essential information may be incomplete or wrong while developed foreign markets may be less risky than emerging markets increasing globalization can make any market vulnerable to events elsewhere in the world a second major factor is currency exchange rates when the dollar value of a foreign currency falls so does the value of any investments the fund owns that are denominated in that currency this is separate from market risk and may add to market losses or reduce market gains because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies other factors that could affect performance include o the managers could be wrong in their analysis of industries companies economic trends geographical areas or other matters o derivatives could produce disproportionate losses o at times market conditions might make it hard to value some investments or to get an attractive price for them

approval o as a temporary defensive measure the fund could shift up to  of its assets into investments such as us or canadian money market securities this could help prevent losses but would mean that the fund was not pursuing its goal o the fund may trade securities actively this could raise transaction costs thus lowering return and could mean higher taxable distributions euro conversion funds

nav a share class of the fund uses the following equation taking figures for barrett international shares only total assets  total liabilities   nav total number of shares outstanding we typically use market prices to value securities however when a market price isnt available or when we have reason to believe it doesnt represent market realities we may use fair value methods approved by the funds board in such a case the funds value for a security is likely to be different from quoted market prices to the extent that the fund invests in securities that are traded primarily in foreign markets the value of its holdings could change at a time when you arent able to buy or sell fund shares this is because some foreign markets are open on days or at times when the fund doesnt price its shares

intended purposes in all markets certain practices techniques or instruments may not be principal activities of a fund but to the extent employed could from time to time have a material impact on that funds performance scudder global fund the fund seeks longterm growth while actively seeking to reduce downside risk as compared with other global growth funds the fund will not invest in securities issued by tobaccoproducing companies although the fund can  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd invest in companies of any size it generally focuses on established companies whose stocks are listed on a recognized exchange while most of the funds equities are common stocks some may be other types of equities such as convertible stocks preferred stocks and depository receipts the fund may also buy investment grade debt securities when it believes they may perform at least as well as equities the management of the fund believes that there is substantial opportunity for longterm capital growth from a professionally managed portfolio of securities selected from the us and foreign equity markets through this global investment framework management seeks to take advantage of the investment opportunities created by the global economy the world has become highly integrated in economic industrial and financial terms companies increasingly operate globally as they purchase raw materials produce and sell their products and raise capital as a result international trends such as movements in currency and trading relationships are becoming more important to many industries than purely domestic influences to understand a companys business it is frequently more important to understand how it is linked to the world economy than whether or not it is for example a us french or swiss company just as a company takes a global perspective in deciding where to operate so too may an investor benefit from looking globally in deciding which industries are growing which producers are efficient and which companies shares are undervalued the fund affords the investor access to potential opportunities wherever they arise without being constrained by the location of a companys headquarters or the trading market for its shares the fund invests in companies that the advisor believes will benefit from global economic trends promising technologies or products and specific country opportunities resulting from changing geopolitical currency or economic considerations it is expected that investments will be spread broadly around the world the fund will be invested usually in securities of issuers located in at least three countries one of which may be the us the fund may be invested  in nonus issues and for temporary defensive purposes may be invested  in us issues although under normal circumstances it is expected that both foreign and us investments will be represented in the funds portfolio it is expected that investments will include companies of varying sizes as measured by assets sales or capitalization the fund generally invests in equity securities of established companies listed on us or foreign securities exchanges but also may invest in securities traded overthecounter it also may invest in debt securities convertible into common stock and convertible and nonconvertible preferred stock and fixedincome securities of governments governmental agencies supranational agencies and companies when the advisor believes the potential for appreciation will equal or exceed that available from investments in equity securities in addition for temporary defensive purposes the fund may vary from its investment policies during periods when the advisor determines that it is advisable to do so because of conditions in the securities markets or other economic or political conditions during such periods the fund may hold without limit cash and cash equivalents it is impossible to accurately predict for how long such alternative strategies may be utilized the fund may not invest more than  of its total assets in debt securities that are rated baa or below by moodys investors service inc moodys or bbb or below by standard and poors ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc sp or deemed by the advisor to be of comparable quality commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds more information about these investment techniques is provided under investments and investment techniques the managers use analytical tools to monitor actively the risk profile of the portfolio as compared to comparable funds and appropriate benchmarks and peer groups the managers use several strategies in seeking to reduce downside risk including i diversifying broadly among companies industries countries and regions ii focusing on highquality companies with reasonable valuations and iii generally focusing on countries with developed economies the portfolio managers attempts to manage downside risk may also reduce performance in a strong market the fund is intended to provide individual and institutional investors with an opportunity to invest a portion of their assets in a globally oriented portfolio and is designed for longterm investors who can accept global investment risk the advisor believes that allocation of assets on a global basis decreases the degree to which events in any one country including the us will affect an investors entire investment holdings in the period since world war ii many leading foreign economies have grown more rapidly than the us economy thus providing investment opportunities although there can be no assurance that this will be true in the future as with any longterm investment the value of the funds shares when sold may be higher or lower than when purchased investors should recognize that investing in foreign securities involves certain special considerations including those set forth below which are not typically associated with investing in us securities and which may favorably or unfavorably affect the funds performance as foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform standards  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th practices and requirements with respect to accounting auditing and financial reporting as are domestic companies there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than about a domestic company many foreign securities markets while growing in volume of trading activity have substantially less volume than the us market and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of domestic issuers similarly volume and liquidity in most foreign bond markets is less than in the us and at times volatility of price can be greater than in the us further foreign markets have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions making it difficult to conduct such transactions delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when assets of the fund are uninvested and no return is earned thereon the inability of the fund to make intended security purchases due to settlement problems could cause the fund to miss attractive investment opportunities inability to dispose of portfolio securities due to settlement problems either could result in losses to the fund due to subsequent declines in value of the portfolio security or if the fund has entered into a contract to sell the security could result in possible liability to the purchaser fixed commissions on some foreign securities exchanges and bid to asked spreads in foreign bond markets are generally higher than negotiated commissions on us exchanges and bid to asked spreads in the us bond market although the fund will endeavor to achieve the most favorable net results on their portfolio transactions further the fund may encounter difficulties or be unable to pursue legal remedies and obtain judgments in foreign courts there is generally less governmental supervision and regulation of business and industry practices securities exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the us it may be more difficult for the funds agents to keep currently informed about corporate actions such as stock dividends or other matters which may affect the prices of portfolio securities communications between the us and foreign countries may be less reliable than within the us thus increasing the risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for portfolio securities payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect us investments in those countries investments in foreign securities may also entail certain risks such as possible currency blockages or transfer restrictions and the difficulty of enforcing rights in other countries moreover individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position the management of the fund seeks to mitigate the risks associated with the foregoing considerations through continuous professional management these considerations generally are more of a concern in developing countries for example the possibility of revolution and the dependence on foreign economic assistance may be greater in these countries than in developed countries investments in companies domiciled in developing countries may be subject to potentially greater risks than investments in developed countries investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries because of the considerations discussed above the value of the assets of the fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer the fund will conduct their foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into strategic transactions involving currencies see strategic transactions and derivatives because the fund may be invested in both us and foreign securities markets changes in the funds share price may have a low correlation with movements in the us markets the funds share price will reflect the movements of both the different stock and bond markets in which it is invested and of the currencies in which the investments are denominated the strength or weakness of the us dollar against foreign currencies may account for part of the funds investment performance foreign securities such as those purchased by the fund may be subject to foreign governmental taxes which could reduce the yield on such securities although a shareholder of the fund may subject to certain limitations be entitled to claim a credit or deduction for us federal income tax purposes for his or her proportionate share of such foreign taxes paid by the fund us and foreign securities markets do not always move  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th in step with each other and the total returns from different markets may vary significantly the fund invests in many securities markets around the world in an attempt to take advantage of opportunities wherever they may arise because of the funds investment considerations discussed above and the investment policies investment in shares of a fund is not intended to provide a complete investment program for an investor the fund cannot guarantee a gain or eliminate the risk of loss the net asset value of the funds shares will increase or decrease with changes in the market price of the funds investments and there is no assurance that the funds objectives will be achieved scudder international fund the fund seeks longterm growth of capital by investing at least  of its total assets in foreign equities equities issued by foreignbased companies and listed on foreign exchanges these securities are selected primarily to permit the fund to participate in nonus companies and economies that are believed to have prospects for growth the fund invests in companies wherever organized which do business primarily outside the united states the fund generally invests in equity securities of established companies listed on foreign exchanges although the fund may also invest in securities traded over the counter which the advisor believes have favorable characteristics the funds equity investments include common stock convertible and nonconvertible preferred stock sponsored and unsponsored depository receipts and warrants when the advisor believes that it is appropriate to do so in order to achieve the funds investment objective of longterm capital growth the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities such debt securities include debt securities of governments governmental agencies supranational organizations and private issuers including bonds denominated in the european currency unit the euro portfolio debt investments will be selected on the basis of among other things yield credit quality and the fundamental outlooks for currency and interest rate trends in different parts of the globe taking into account the ability to hedge a degree of currency or local bond price risk the value of fixedincome investments will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and bond market conditions tending to rise as interest rates decline and decline as interest rates rise the fund will predominantly purchase investmentgrade bonds which are those rated aaa aa a or baa by moodys or aaa aa a or bbb by sp or if unrated judged by the advisor to be of equivalent quality the fund may also invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade see risk factors the fund intends to diversify investments among several countries and normally to have investments in securities of at least three different countries other than the us the fund will invest primarily in securities of issuers in the  developed foreign countries included in the morgan stanley capital international msci europe australia far east eafe and canada index but may invest in emerging markets the fund considers emerging markets to include any country that is defined as an emerging or developing economy by any of the international bank of reconstruction and development ie the world bank the international finance corporation or the united nations or its authorities it is expected that the funds investments will include companies of varying size as measured by assets sales or market capitalization the major portion of the funds assets consists of equity securities of established companies listed on recognized exchanges the advisor expects this condition to continue although the fund may invest in other securities in selecting securities for the funds portfolio the advisor applies a disciplined multipart investment approach for selecting stocks for the fund in analyzing companies for investment the advisor ordinarily looks for one or more of the following characteristics strong competitive positioning aboveaverage earnings growth per share high return on invested capital healthy balance sheets and overall financial strength strength of management and general operating characteristics which will enable the companies to compete successfully in the marketplace the advisor will further seek to have broad country representation favoring those countries that it believes have sound economic conditions and open markets the advisor will also look for opportunities on a macroeconomic level seeking to identify major changes in the business environment and companies that are poised to benefit from these changes investment decisions are made without regard to arbitrary criteria as to minimum asset size debtequity ratios or dividend history of portfolio companies the advisor will typically sell an investment when certain criteria are met including but not limited to the price of the security reaches the advisors assessment of its fair value the  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th underlying investment theme is judged by the advisor to have matured or if the original reason for investing in the security no longer applies or is no longer valid in applying the disciplined multipart investment approach for selecting stocks for the fund the advisor first analyzes the pool of foreign dividendpaying securities primarily from the worlds more mature markets and targeting stocks that have high relative yields compared to the average for their markets in the advisors opinion this group of higheryielding stocks offers the potential for returns that is greater than or equal to the average market return with price volatility that is lower than the overall market volatility the advisor believes that these potentially favorable risk and return characteristics exist because the higher dividends offered by these stocks act as a cushion when markets are volatile and because the stocks with higher yields tend to have more attractive valuations eg lower pricetoearning ratios and lower pricetobook ratios the second stage of portfolio construction involves a fundamental analysis of each companys financial strength profitability projected earnings competitive positioning and ability of management during this step the advisors research team identifies what it believes are the most promising stocks for the funds portfolio the third stage of the investment process involves diversifying the portfolio among different industry sectors the key element of this stage is evaluating how the stocks in different sectors react to economic factors such as interest rates inflation gross domestic product and consumer spending and then attaining a proper balance of stocks in these sectors based on the advisors economic forecast the fourth and final stage of this ongoing process is diversifying the portfolio among different countries the advisor will seek to have broad country representation favoring those countries that it believes have sound economic conditions and open markets the funds strategy is to manage risk and create opportunity at each of the four stages in its investment process starting with the focus on stocks with high relative yields the fund may hold up to  of its net assets in us and foreign fixed income securities for temporary defensive purposes when the advisor believes that market conditions so warrant the fund may invest up to  of its net assets under normal conditions and without limit for temporary defensive purposes in cash or cash equivalents including domestic and foreign money market instruments shortterm government and corporate obligations and repurchase agreements when the advisor deems such a position advisable in light of economic or market conditions it is impossible to predict how long alternative strategies may be utilized in addition the fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements illiquid securities and strategic transactions which may include derivatives foreign securities such as those purchased by the fund may be subject to foreign governmental taxes which could reduce the yield on such securities although a shareholder of the fund may subject to certain limitations be entitled to claim a credit or deduction for us federal income tax purposes for

benefit a fund after taking into account considerations such as the costs of the borrowing each fund does not expect to borrow for investment purposes to increase return or leverage the portfolio borrowing by a fund will involve special risk considerations although the principal of a funds borrowings will be fixed a funds assets may change in value during the time that a borrowing is outstanding thus increasing exposure to capital risk common stocks under normal circumstances each fund invests primarily in common stocks common stock is issued by companies to raise cash for business purposes and represents a proportionate interest in the issuing companies therefore the fund participates in the success or failure of any company in which it holds stock the market values of common stock can fluctuate significantly reflecting the business performance of the issuing company investor perception and general economic or financial market movements smaller companies are especially sensitive to these factors and may even become valueless despite the risk of price volatility however common stock also offers greater potential for longterm gain on investment compared to other classes of financial assets such as bonds or cash equivalents convertible securities each fund may invest in convertible securities that is bonds notes debentures preferred stocks and other securities which are convertible into common stock investments in convertible securities can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation andor income through interest and dividend payments by virtue of their conversion or exchange features the convertible securities in which a fund may invest are either fixed income or zero coupon debt securities which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying shares of common stock the exchange ratio for any particular convertible security may be adjusted from time to time due to stock splits dividends spinoffs other corporate distributions or scheduled changes in the exchange ratio convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stocks until converted have general characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities although to a lesser extent than with debt securities generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely tends to increase as interest rates decline in addition because of the conversion or exchange feature the market value of convertible securities typically changes as the market value of the underlying common stocks changes and therefore also tends to follow movements in the general market for equity securities a unique feature of convertible securities is that as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the prices of the convertible securities tend to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock although typically not as much as the underlying common stock while no securities investments are without risk investments in convertible securities generally entail less risk than investments in common stock of the same issuer as debt securities convertible securities are investments which provide for a stream of income or in the case of zero coupon securities accretion of income with generally higher yields than common stocks of course like all debt securities there can be no assurance of income or principal payments because the issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations convertible securities generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality because of their conversion or exchange features convertible securities generally are subordinated to other similar but nonconvertible securities of the same issuer although convertible bonds as corporate debt obligations enjoy seniority in right of payment to all equity securities and convertible preferred stock is senior to common stock of the same issuer however because of the subordination feature convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock typically have lower ratings than similar nonconvertible securities convertible securities may be issued as fixed income obligations that pay current income or as zero coupon notes and bonds including liquid yield option notes lyonstm currency transactions

currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the

options options on futures and swaps generally will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except as described below transaction hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of the funds which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of their portfolio securities or the receipt of income therefrom position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency a fund generally will not enter into a transaction to hedge currency exposure to an extent greater after netting all transactions intended wholly or partially to offset other transactions than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the transaction of the securities held in its portfolio that are denominated or generally quoted in or currently convertible into such currency other than with respect to proxy hedging or cross hedging as described below the funds may also crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which the funds have or in which the funds expect to have portfolio exposure to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of portfolio securities the funds may also engage in proxy hedging proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which a funds portfolio is exposed is difficult to hedge or to hedge against the dollar proxy hedging entails entering into a commitment or option to sell a currency whose changes in value are generally considered to be correlated to a currency or currencies in which some or all of a funds portfolio securities are or are expected to be denominated in exchange for us dollars the amount of the commitment or option would not exceed the value of a funds securities denominated in correlated currencies for example if the advisor considers that the austrian schilling is correlated to the german deutschemark the dmark the funds holds securities denominated in schillings and the advisor believes that the value of schillings will decline against the us dollar the advisor may enter into a commitment or option to sell dmarks and buy dollars currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments currency transactions can result in losses to the funds if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further there is the risk that the perceived correlation between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time that the funds are engaging in proxy hedging if the funds enter into a currency hedging transaction the funds will comply with the asset segregation requirements described below risks of currency transactions currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses to a fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs buyers and sellers of currency futures are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures is

of unsponsored depository receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the united states and therefore there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depository receipts adrs are depository receipts which are bought and sold in the united states and are typically issued by a us bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities by a foreign corporation gdrs idrs and other types of depository receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they may also be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation generally depository receipts in registered form are designed for use in the united states securities markets and depository receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities markets outside the united states for purposes of each funds investment policies the funds investments in adrs gdrs and other types of depository receipts will be deemed to be investments in the underlying securities depository receipts other than those denominated in us dollars will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk however by investing in adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock the fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period in general there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs however certain depository receipts may not be listed on an exchange and therefore may be illiquid securities dollar roll transactions dollar roll transactions consist of the sale by a fund to a bank or brokerdealers the counterparty of gnma certificates or other mortgagebacked securities together with a commitment to purchase from the counterparty similar but not identical securities at a future date at the same price the counterparty receives all principal and interest payments including prepayments made on the security while it is the holder a fund receives a fee from the counterparty as consideration for entering into the commitment to purchase dollar rolls may be renewed over a period of several months with a different purchase and repurchase price fixed and a cash settlement made at each renewal without a physical delivery of securities moreover the transaction may be preceded by a firm commitment agreement pursuant to which the fund agrees to buy a security on a later date a fund will segregate cash us government securities or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to meet their purchase obligations under the transactions the fund will also maintain asset coverage of at least  for all outstanding firm commitments dollar rolls and other borrowings dollar rolls may be treated for purposes of the  act as borrowings of a fund because they involve the sale of a security coupled with an agreement to repurchase a dollar roll involves costs to a fund for example while a fund receives a fee as consideration for agreeing to repurchase the security a fund forgoes the right to receive all principal and interest payments while the counterparty holds the security these payments to the counterparty may exceed the fee received by a fund thereby effectively charging a fund interest on its borrowing further although a fund can estimate the amount of expected principal prepayment over the term of the dollar roll a variation in the actual amount of prepayment could increase or decrease the cost of a funds borrowing the entry into dollar rolls involves potential risks of loss that are different from those related to the securities underlying the transactions for example if the counterparty becomes insolvent a funds right to purchase from the counterparty might be restricted additionally the value of such securities may change adversely before a fund is able to purchase them similarly a fund may be required to purchase securities in connection with a dollar roll at a higher price than may otherwise be available on the open market since as noted above the counterparty is required to deliver a similar but not identical security to a fund the security that a fund is required to buy under the dollar roll may be worth less than an identical security finally there can be no assurance that a funds use of the cash that it receives from a dollar roll will provide a return that exceeds borrowing costs eurodollar instruments the funds may make investments in eurodollar instruments eurodollar instruments are us dollardenominated futures contracts or

futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in libor to which many interest rate swaps and fixed income instruments are linked foreign currencies because investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries and because the funds may hold foreign currencies and forward contracts futures contracts and options on foreign currencies and foreign currency futures contracts the value of the assets of the fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs and experience conversion difficulties and uncertainties in connection with conversions between various currencies in particular the funds foreign investments are generally denominated in foreign currencies the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies is responsible for part of the funds investment performance if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen for example the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall in addition many foreign currencies have experienced significant devaluation relative to the dollar although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer a fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into options or forward or futures contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies foreign investment risk while the funds offer the potential for substantial appreciation over time they also involve aboveaverage investment risk in comparison to a mutual fund investing in a broad range of us equity securities each fund is designed as a longterm investment and not for shortterm trading purposes none of the funds nor the funds together should be considered a complete investment program although each could serve as a core international holding for an individuals portfolio each funds net asset value or price can fluctuate significantly with changes in stock market levels political developments movements in currencies global investment flows and other factors foreign securities investing in foreign securities involves certain special considerations including those set forth below which are not typically associated with investing in us securities and which may favorably or unfavorably affect the funds performance as foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic companies there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than about a domestic company many foreign securities markets while growing in volume of trading activity have substantially less volume than the us market and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of domestic issuers similarly volume and liquidity in most foreign bond markets is less than in the us and at times volatility of price can be greater than in the us fixed commissions on some foreign securities exchanges and bid to asked spreads in foreign bond markets are generally higher than commissions or bid to asked spreads on us markets although the advisor will endeavor to achieve the most favorable net results on its portfolio transactions there is generally less governmental supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed companies in foreign countries than in the us it may be more difficult for a funds agents to keep currently informed about corporate actions in foreign countries which may affect the prices of portfolio securities communications between the us and foreign countries may be less reliable than within the us thus increasing the risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for portfolio securities payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect us investments in those countries moreover individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position the management of each fund seeks to mitigate the risks associated with the

possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk of principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the

more than  of its total assets in securities rated bb or lower by moodys or ba by sp and may invest in securities which are rated d by sp securities rated d may be in default with respect to payment of principal or interest see the appendix to this statement of additional information for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations and their respective characteristics high yield highrisk securities are especially subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions to changes in the financial condition of their issuers and to price fluctuations in response to changes in interest rates an economic downturn could disrupt the high yield market impair the ability of issuers to repay principal and interest and increase an issuers risk of default also an increase in interest rates would have a greater adverse impact on the value of such obligations than on higher quality debt securities during an economic downturn or period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issues may experience financial stress which would adversely affect their ability to service their principal and interest payment obligations prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates the trading market for high yield securities may be thin to the extent that there is no established retail secondary market or because of a decline in the value of such securities a thin trading market may limit the ability of a fund to accurately value high yield securities in its portfolio and to dispose of those securities adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recentlyissued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of a funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of a fund to retain or dispose of such security prices for below investmentgrade securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments for example new federal rules require savings and loan institutions to gradually reduce their holdings of this type of security congress has from time to time considered legislation which would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in these securities and regulate corporate restructurings such legislation may significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type illiquid securities and restricted securities a fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i only to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers or iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid each corporations board of directors has approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is illiquid among the factors the investment manager may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirement that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities a fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses a fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the  act when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event a fund may be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading a fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them a fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between a funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which a fund is permitted or able to sell such security a fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell this investment practice therefore could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity of a fund interfund borrowing and lending program each fund has received exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission the sec that permits each fund to participate in an interfund borrowing and lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent a fund is actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund borrowing and lending program a fund as a matter of nonfundamental policy may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that a fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose investing in emerging markets the funds investments in foreign securities may be in developed countries or in countries considered by the funds advisor to have developing or emerging markets which involves exposure to economic structures that are generally less diverse and mature than in the united states and to political systems that may be less stable a developing or emerging market country can be considered to be a country that is in the initial stages of its industrialization cycle currently emerging markets generally include every country in the world other than the united states canada japan australia new zealand hong kong singapore and most western european countries currently investing in many emerging markets

higher rates of return to investors the advisor believes that these characteristics may be expected to continue in the future most emerging securities markets may have substantially less volume and are subject to less governmental supervision than us securities markets securities of many issuers in emerging markets may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers in addition there is less regulation of securities exchanges securities dealers and listed and unlisted companies in emerging markets than in the us  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have not kept pace with the volume of securities transactions delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when a portion of the assets of a fund is uninvested and no cash is earned thereon the inability of a fund to make intended security purchases due to settlement problems could cause a fund to miss attractive investment opportunities inability to dispose of portfolio securities due to settlement problems could result either in losses to a fund due to subsequent declines in value of the portfolio security or if a fund has entered into a contract to sell the security could result in possible liability to the purchaser costs associated with transactions in foreign securities are generally higher than costs associated with transactions in us securities such transactions also involve additional costs for the purchase or sale of foreign currency foreign investment in certain emerging market debt obligations is restricted or controlled to varying degrees these restrictions or controls may at times limit or preclude foreign investment in certain emerging markets debt obligations and increase the costs and expenses of a fund certain emerging markets require prior governmental approval of investments by foreign persons limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular company limit the investment by foreign persons only to a specific class of securities of a company that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domiciliaries of the countries andor impose additional taxes on foreign investors certain emerging markets may also restrict investment opportunities in issuers in industries deemed important to national interest certain emerging markets may require governmental approval for the repatriation of investment income capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors in addition if a deterioration occurs in an emerging markets balance of payments or for other reasons a country could impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances a fund could be adversely affected by delays in or a refusal to grant any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital as well as by the application to the fund of any restrictions on investments in the course of investment in emerging markets a fund will be exposed to the direct or indirect consequences of political social and economic changes in one or more emerging markets political changes in emerging market countries may affect the willingness of an emerging market countrys governmental issuer to make or provide for timely payments of its obligations the countrys economic status and reflected in among other things its inflation rate the amount of its external debt and its gross domestic product also affects its ability to honor its obligations while a fund will manage its assets in a manner that will seek to minimize the exposure to such risks there can be no assurance that adverse political social or economic changes will not cause a fund to suffer a loss of value in respect of the securities in that funds portfolio the risk also exists that an emergency situation may arise in one or more emerging markets as a result of which trading of securities may cease or may be substantially curtailed and prices for a funds securities in such markets may not be readily available the corporation may suspend redemption of its shares for any period during which an emergency exists as determined by the sec accordingly if a fund believes that appropriate circumstances exist it will promptly apply to the sec for a determination that an emergency is present during the period commencing from a funds identification of such condition until the date of the

judgment may be limited legal recourse is therefore somewhat diminished bankruptcy moratorium and other similar laws applicable to private issuers of debt obligations may be substantially different from those of other countries the political context expressed as an emerging market governmental issuers willingness to meet the terms of the debt obligation for example is of considerable importance in addition no assurance can be given that the holders of commercial bank debt may not contest payments to the holders of debt obligations in the event of default under commercial bank loan agreements income from securities held by a fund could be reduced by a withholding tax at the source or other taxes imposed by the emerging market countries in which that fund makes its investments a funds net asset value may also be affected by changes in the rates or methods of taxation applicable to that fund or to entities in which that fund has invested the advisor will consider the cost of any taxes in determining whether to acquire any particular investments but can provide no assurance that the taxes will not be subject to change many emerging markets have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation for many years inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries in an attempt to control inflation wage and price controls have been imposed in certain countries of these countries some in recent years have begun to control inflation through prudent economic policies emerging market governmental issuers are among the largest debtors to commercial banks foreign governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions certain emerging market governmental issuers have not been able to make payments of interest on or principal of debt obligations as those payments have come due obligations

continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector through the ownership or control of many companies including some of the largest in any given country as a result governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in emerging markets which in turn may adversely affect companies in the private sector general market conditions and prices and yields of certain of the securities in a funds portfolio expropriation confiscatory taxation nationalization political economic or social instability or other similar developments have occurred frequently over the history of certain emerging markets and could adversely affect the funds assets should these conditions recur the ability of emerging market country governmental issuers to make timely payments on their obligations is likely to be influenced strongly by the issuers balance of payments including export performance and its access to international credits and investments an emerging market whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities could be vulnerable to a decline in the international prices of one or more of those commodities increased protectionism on the part of an emerging markets trading partners could also adversely affect the countrys exports and diminish its trade account surplus if any to the extent that emerging markets receive payment for their exports in currencies other than dollars or nonemerging market currencies their ability to make debt payments denominated in dollars or nonemerging market currencies could be affected another factor bearing on the ability of emerging market countries to repay debt obligations is the level of international reserves of the country fluctuations in the level of these reserves affect the amount of foreign exchange readily available for external debt payments and thus could have a bearing on the capacity of emerging market countries to make payments on these debt obligations to the extent that an emerging market country cannot generate a trade surplus it must depend on continuing loans from foreign governments multilateral organizations or private commercial banks aid payments from foreign governments and inflows of foreign investment the access of emerging markets to these forms of external funding may not be certain and a withdrawal of external funding could adversely affect the capacity of emerging market country governmental issuers to make payments on their obligations in addition the cost of servicing emerging market debt obligations can be affected by a change in international interest rates since the majority of these obligations carry interest rates that are adjusted periodically based upon international rates

investment in the central funds does not exceed  of its total assets purchase and sales of shares of central funds are made at net asset value lending of portfolio securities each fund may seek to increase its income by lending portfolio securities such loans may be made to registered brokerdealers and are required to be secured continuously by collateral in cash us government securities and liquid high grade debt obligations maintained on a current basis at an amount at least equal to the market value and accrued interest of the securities loaned each fund has the right to call a loan and obtain the securities loaned on no more than five days notice or in connection with securities trading on foreign markets within such longer period of time which coincides with the normal settlement period for purchases and sales of such securities in such foreign markets during the existence of a loan a fund will continue to receive the equivalent of any distributions paid by the issuer on the securities loaned and will also receive compensation based on investment of the collateral as with other extensions of credit there are risks of delay in recovery or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially however the loans will be made only to firms deemed by the advisor to be in good standing the value of the securities loaned will not exceed  of the value of a funds total assets at the time any loan is made real estate investment trusts reits global fund may invest in reits reits are sometimes informally characterized as equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits investment in reits may subject the fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate such as decreases in real estate values overbuilding increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions increases in operating costs and property taxes changes in zoning laws casualty or condemnation losses possible environmental liabilities regulatory limitations on rent and fluctuations in rental income equity reits generally experience these risks directly through fee or leasehold interests whereas mortgage reits generally experience these risks indirectly through mortgage interests unless the mortgage reit forecloses on the underlying real estate changes in interest rates may also affect the value of the funds investment in reits for instance during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those reits certain reits have relatively small market capitalizations which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of their securities furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills have limited diversification and are therefore subject to risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and to maintain exemption from the registration requirements of the  act by investing in reits indirectly through the fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the funds but also indirectly similar expenses of the reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders repurchase agreements each fund may invest in repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement the fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer some repurchase commitment transactions may not provide a fund with collateral markedtomarket during the term of the commitment  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th a repurchase agreement provides a means for a fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie a fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and the value of such securities kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to a fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to the fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case the income to a fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by a fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by a fund or as being collateral for a loan by a fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement a fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation a fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor a fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt instrument purchased for a fund the advisor seeks to reduce the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case a fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to the fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value including interestof the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest a fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price it is possible that a fund will be unsuccessful in seeking to enforce the sellers contractual obligation to deliver additional securities reverse repurchase agreements each fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which a fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase such securities at an agreed upon time and price each fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements each fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of a funds assets and its yield trust preferred securities each fund may invest in trust preferred securities which are hybrid instruments issued by a special purpose trust the special trust the entire equity interest of which is owned by a single issuer the proceeds of the issuance to a fund of trust preferred securities are typically used to purchase a junior subordinated debenture and distributions from the special trust are funded by the payments of principal and interest on the subordinated debenture if payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures held by the special trust are deferred by the debenture issuer the debentures would be treated as original issue discount oid obligations for the remainder of their term as a result holders of trust preferred securities such as a fund would be required to accrue daily for federal income tax purposes their share of the stated interest and the de minimis oid on the debentures regardless of whether a fund receives any cash distributions from the special trust and the value of trust preferred securities would likely be negatively affected interest payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures typically may only be deferred if dividends are suspended on both common and preferred stock of the issuer the underlying junior subordinated debentures generally rank slightly higher in terms of payment priority than both common and preferred securities of the issuer but rank below other subordinated debentures and debt securities trust preferred securities may be subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances the market values of trust preferred securities may be more volatile than those of conventional debt securities trust preferred securities may be issued in reliance on rule a under the  act and unless and until registered are restricted securities there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of trust preferred securities and the ability of holders of trust preferred securities such as a fund to sell their holdings warrants international fund may invest in warrants up to  of the value of its net assets the holder of a warrant has the right until the warrant expires to purchase a given number of shares of a particular issuer at a specified  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th price such investments can provide a greater potential for profit or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security prices of warrants do not necessarily move in tandem with the prices of the underlying securities however and are therefore considered to be speculative investments warrants pay no dividends and confer no rights other than a purchase option thus if a warrant held by the fund were not exercised by the date of its expiration the fund would lose the entire purchase price of the warrant whenissued and forward delivery securities each fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the whenissued or forward delivery securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by a fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to a fund to the extent that assets of a fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities a fund would earn no income however it is each funds intention to be fully invested to the extent practicable and subject to the policies stated above while whenissued or forward delivery securities may be sold prior to the settlement date each fund intends to purchase such securities with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time a fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on a whenissued or forward delivery basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value at the time of the settlement the market value of the whenissued or forward delivery securities may be more or less than the purchase price each fund does not believe that its net asset value or income will be adversely affected by its purchase of securities on a whenissued or forward delivery basis zero coupon securities global fund may invest in zero coupon securities which pay no cash income and are sold at substantial discounts from their value at maturity when held to maturity their entire income which consists of accretion of discount comes from the difference between the issue price and their value at maturity zero coupon securities are subject to greater market value fluctuations from changing interest rates than debt obligations of comparable maturities which make current distributions of interest cash zero coupon securities which are convertible into common stock offer the opportunity for capital appreciation as increases or decreases in market value of such securities closely follows the movements in the market value of the underlying common stock zero coupon convertible securities generally are expected to be less volatile than the underlying common stocks as they usually are issued with maturities of  years or less and are issued with options andor redemption features exercisable by the holder of the obligation entitling the holder to redeem the obligation and receive a defined cash payment zero coupon securities include securities issued directly by the us treasury and us treasury bonds or notes and their unmatured interest coupons and receipts for their underlying principal coupons which have been separated by their holder typically a custodian bank or investment brokerage firm a holder will separate the interest coupons from the underlying principal the corpus of the us treasury security a number of securities firms and banks have stripped the interest coupons and receipts and then resold them in custodial receipt programs with a number of different names including treasury income growth receipts tigrstm and certificate of accrual on treasuries catstm the underlying us treasury bonds and notes themselves are held in bookentry form at the federal reserve bank or in the case of bearer securities ie unregistered securities which are owned ostensibly by the bearer or holder thereof in trust on behalf of the owners thereof counsel to the underwriters of these certificates or other evidences of ownership of the us treasury securities have stated that for federal tax and securities purposes in their opinion purchasers of such certificates such as the fund most likely will be deemed the beneficial holder of the underlying us government securities the fund understands that the staff of the division of investment management of the sec no longer considers such privately stripped obligations to be us government securities as defined in the  act therefore the fund intends to adhere to this staff position and will not treat such privately stripped obligations to be us government securities for the purpose of determining if the global fund is diversified under the  act the us treasury has facilitated transfers of ownership of zero coupon securities by accounting separately for the beneficial ownership of particular interest coupon and corpus payments on treasury securities through the federal reserve bookentry record keeping system the federal reserve program as established by the treasury department is known as strips or separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities under the strips program the fund will be able to have its beneficial ownership of zero coupon securities recorded directly in the bookentry recordkeeping system in lieu of having to hold certificates or other evidences of ownership of the underlying us treasury securities  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th when us treasury obligations have been stripped of their unmatured interest coupons by the holder the principal or corpus is sold at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a future fixed payment on the security and does not receive any rights to periodic interest cash payments once stripped or separated the corpus and coupons may be sold separately typically the coupons are sold separately or grouped with other coupons with like maturity dates and sold bundled in such form purchasers of stripped obligations acquire in effect discount obligations that are economically identical to the zero coupon securities that the treasury sells itself strategic transactions and derivatives each fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of fixedincome securities in a funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies the fund may purchase and sell exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity and fixedincome indices and other instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors collars currency forward contracts currency futures contracts currency swaps or options on currencies or currency futures and various other currency transactions collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include new techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit subject to certain limitations imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for a funds portfolio resulting from securities markets or currency exchange rate fluctuations to protect a funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of fixedincome securities in a funds portfolio or to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain though no more than  of a funds assets will be committed to strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of the fund to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the funds will comply with applicable regulatory requirements when implementing these strategies techniques and instruments strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of the funds and the funds will segregate assets or as provided by applicable regulations enter into certain offsetting positions to cover its obligations under options futures and swaps to limit leveraging of the funds strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation a fund can realize on its investments or cause the fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in the funds incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of a funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets a fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchases of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of futures the funds may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate currency or equity market changes and for  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the funds as seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position a funds use of futures and options thereon will in all cases be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and in particular the rules and regulations of the commodity futures trading commission and will be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires a fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the mark to market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of the funds if the funds exercise an option on a futures contract they will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as they would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur a fund will not enter into a futures contract or related option except for closing transactions if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of its initial margin and premiums on open futures contracts and options thereon would exceed  of a funds total assets taken at current value however in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of the purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation the segregation requirements with respect to futures contracts and options thereon are described below general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance a funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving the funds the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price a funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto the funds are authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties the funds will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting the funds to require the counterparty to sell the option back to the funds at a formula price within seven days the funds expect generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although they are not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with the funds or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option the funds will lose any premium they paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied the funds will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or in the case of otc currency transactions are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by the funds and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if the funds sell a call option the premium that they receive may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in their portfolio or will increase a funds income the sale of put options can also provide income the funds may purchase and sell call options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts all calls sold by the funds must be covered ie the funds must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though the funds will receive the option premium to help protect them against loss a call sold by the funds exposes the funds during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require the funds to hold a security or instrument which they might otherwise have sold the funds may purchase and sell put options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments whether or not they hold the above securities in their portfolios and on  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd securities indices currencies and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities the funds will not sell put options if as a result more than  of a funds assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that the funds may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price options on securities indices and other financial indices the funds also may purchase and sell call and put options on securities indices and other financial indices and in so doing can achieve many of the same objectives it would achieve through the sale or purchase of options on individual securities or other instruments options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option on an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making up the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities risks of strategic transactions outside the us when conducted outside the us strategic transactions may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in a funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity combined transactions the funds may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single strategic transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the advisor it is in the best interests of the funds to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisors judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which the funds may enter are interest rate currency index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars the funds expect to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of securities the funds anticipate purchasing at a later date the funds will not sell interest rate caps or floors where they do not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the funds may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the funds with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values the funds will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with the funds receiving or paying as the case  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd may be only the net amount of the two payments inasmuch as the funds will segregate assets or enter into offsetting positions to cover their obligations under swaps the advisor and the funds believe such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the  act and accordingly will not treat them as being subject to their borrowing restrictions the funds will not enter into any swap cap floor or collar transaction unless at the time of entering into such transaction the unsecured longterm debt of the counterparty combined with any credit enhancements is rated at least a by sp or moodys or has an equivalent rating from a

documentation as a result the swap market has become relatively liquid caps floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully developed and accordingly they are less liquid than swaps use of segregated and other special accounts many strategic transactions in addition to other requirements require that a fund segregate cash or liquid assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by the funds to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid assets at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by the funds will require the funds to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by the funds on an index will require the funds to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by the funds requires the funds to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price except when the funds enter into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency which requires no segregation a currency contract which obligates the funds to buy or sell currency will generally require the funds to hold an amount of that currency or liquid assets denominated in that currency equal to the funds obligations or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the amount of a funds obligation otc options entered into by the funds including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when the fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by the funds or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when the fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price the fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by the funds other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and the fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon the fund must deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition to segregating cash or liquid assets sufficient to meet their obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such liquid assets may consist of cash cash equivalents liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps the fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of their obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars

with applicable regulatory policies a fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and strategic transactions for example the fund could purchase a put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by the fund moreover if a fund held a futures or forward contract instead of segregating cash or liquid assets it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held other strategic transactions may also be offset in combinations if the offsetting transaction terminates at the time of or after the primary transaction no segregation is required but if it terminates prior to such time cash or liquid assets equal to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated each funds activities involving strategic

corporate bonds ratings of corporate bonds sp debt rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by sp capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong debt rated aa has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differs from the highest rated issues only in small degree debt rated a has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories debt rated bbb is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories debt rated bb b ccc cc and c is regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such debt will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions debt rated bb has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments the bb rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bbb rating debt rated b has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to pay interest and repay principal the b rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bb or bb rating debt rated ccc has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions it is not likely to have the capacity to pay interest and repay principal the ccc rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied b or b rating the rating cc typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied ccc rating the rating c typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt which is assigned an actual or implied ccc debt rating the c rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed but debt service payments are continued the rating c is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being paid debt rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period had not expired unless sp believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are jeopardized moodys bonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well bonds which are rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class bonds which are rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small bonds which are rated caa are of poor standing such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest bonds which are rated ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings bonds which are rated c are the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st statement of additional

seeking to reduce downside risk as compared with other global growth funds the fund will not invest in securities issued by tobaccoproducing companies although the fund can invest in companies of any size it generally focuses on established companies whose stocks are listed on a recognized exchange while most of the funds equities are common stocks some may be other types of equities such as convertible stocks  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th preferred stocks and depository receipts the fund may also buy investment grade debt securities when it believes they may perform at least as well as equities the management of the fund believes that there is substantial opportunity for longterm capital growth from a professionally managed portfolio of securities selected from the us and foreign equity markets through this global investment framework management seeks to take advantage of the investment opportunities created by the global economy the world has become highly integrated in economic industrial and financial terms companies increasingly operate globally as they purchase raw materials produce and sell their products and raise capital as a result international trends such as movements in currency and trading relationships are becoming more important to many industries than purely domestic influences to understand a companys business it is frequently more important to understand how it is linked to the world economy than whether or not it is for example a us french or swiss company just as a company takes a global perspective in deciding where to operate so too may an investor benefit from looking globally in deciding which industries are growing which producers are efficient and which companies shares are undervalued the fund affords the investor access to potential opportunities wherever they arise without being constrained by the location of a companys headquarters or the trading market for its shares the fund invests in companies that the advisor believes will benefit from global economic trends promising technologies or products and specific country opportunities resulting from changing geopolitical currency or economic considerations it is expected that investments will be spread broadly around the world the fund will be invested usually in securities of issuers located in at least three countries one of which may be the us the fund may be invested  in nonus issues and for temporary defensive purposes may be invested  in us issues although under normal circumstances it is expected that both foreign and us investments will be represented in the funds portfolio it is expected that investments will include companies of varying sizes as measured by assets sales or capitalization the fund generally invests in equity securities of established companies listed on us or foreign securities exchanges but also may invest in securities traded overthecounter it also may invest in debt securities convertible into common stock and convertible and nonconvertible preferred stock and fixedincome securities of governments governmental agencies supranational agencies and companies when the advisor believes the potential for appreciation will equal or exceed that available from investments in equity securities in addition for temporary defensive purposes the fund may vary from its investment policies during periods when the advisor determines that it is advisable to do so because of conditions in the securities markets or other economic or political conditions during such periods the fund may hold without limit cash and cash equivalents it is impossible to accurately predict for how long such alternative strategies may be utilized the fund may not invest more than  of its total assets in debt securities that are rated baa or below by moodys investors service inc moodys or bbb or below by standard and poors ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc sp or deemed by the advisor to be of comparable quality commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds more information about these investment techniques is provided under investments and investment techniques the managers use analytical tools to monitor actively the risk profile of the portfolio as compared to comparable funds and appropriate benchmarks and peer groups the managers use several strategies in seeking to reduce downside risk including i diversifying broadly among companies industries countries and regions ii focusing on highquality companies with reasonable valuations and iii generally focusing on countries with developed economies the portfolio managers attempts to manage downside risk may also reduce performance in a strong market the fund is intended to provide individual and institutional investors with an opportunity to invest a portion of their assets in a globally oriented portfolio and is designed for longterm investors who can accept global investment risk the advisor believes that allocation of assets on a global basis decreases the degree to which events in any one country including the us will affect an investors entire investment holdings in the period since world war ii many leading foreign economies have grown more rapidly than the us economy thus providing investment opportunities although there can be no assurance that this will be true in the future as with any longterm investment the value of the funds shares when sold may be higher or lower than when purchased investors should recognize that investing in foreign securities involves certain special considerations including those set forth below which are not typically associated with investing in us securities and which may favorably or unfavorably affect the funds performance as foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform standards practices and requirements with respect to accounting auditing and financial reporting as are domestic companies there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than about a domestic company many foreign securities markets while growing in volume of trading activity have substantially less volume than the us market and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of domestic issuers similarly volume and liquidity in most foreign bond markets is less than in the us and at times volatility of price can be greater than in the  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th us further foreign markets have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions making it difficult to conduct such transactions delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when assets of the fund are uninvested and no return is earned thereon the inability of the fund to make intended security purchases due to settlement problems could cause the fund to miss attractive investment opportunities inability to dispose of portfolio securities due to settlement problems either could result in losses to the fund due to subsequent declines in value of the portfolio security or if the fund has entered into a contract to sell the security could result in possible liability to the purchaser fixed commissions on some foreign securities exchanges and bid to asked spreads in foreign bond markets are generally higher than negotiated commissions on us exchanges and bid to asked spreads in the us bond market although the fund will endeavor to achieve the most favorable net results on their portfolio transactions further the fund may encounter difficulties or be unable to pursue legal remedies and obtain judgments in foreign courts there is generally less governmental supervision and regulation of business and industry practices securities exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the us it may be more difficult for the funds agents to keep currently informed about corporate actions such as stock dividends or other matters which may affect the prices of portfolio securities communications between the us and foreign countries may be less reliable than within the us thus increasing the risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for portfolio securities payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect us investments in those countries investments in foreign securities may also entail certain risks such as possible currency blockages or transfer restrictions and the difficulty of enforcing rights in other countries moreover individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position the management of the fund seeks to mitigate the risks associated with the foregoing considerations through continuous professional management these considerations generally are more of a concern in developing countries for example the possibility of revolution and the dependence on foreign economic assistance may be greater in these countries than in developed countries investments in companies domiciled in developing countries may be subject to potentially greater risks than investments in developed countries investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries because of the considerations discussed above the value of the assets of the fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer the fund will conduct their foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into strategic transactions involving currencies see strategic transactions and derivatives because the fund may be invested in both us and foreign securities markets changes in the funds share price may have a low correlation with movements in the us markets the funds share price will reflect the movements of both the different stock and bond markets in which it is invested and of the currencies in which the investments are denominated the strength or weakness of the us dollar against foreign currencies may account for part of the funds investment performance foreign securities such as those purchased by the fund may be subject to foreign governmental taxes which could reduce the yield on such securities although a shareholder of the fund may subject to certain limitations be entitled to claim a credit or deduction for us federal income tax purposes for his or her proportionate share of such foreign taxes paid by the fund us and foreign securities markets do not always move in step with each other and the total returns from different markets may vary significantly the fund invests in many securities markets around the world in an attempt to take advantage of opportunities wherever they may arise because of the funds investment considerations discussed above and the investment policies investment in shares of the fund is not intended to provide a complete investment program for an investor  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the fund cannot guarantee a gain or eliminate the risk of loss the net asset value of the funds shares will increase or decrease with changes in the market price of the funds investments and there is no assurance that the funds objectives will be achieved scudder international fund the fund seeks longterm growth of capital by investing at least  of its total assets in foreign equities equities issued by foreignbased companies and listed on foreign exchanges these securities are selected primarily to permit the fund to participate in nonus companies and economies that are believed to have prospects for growth the fund invests in companies wherever organized which do business primarily outside the united states the fund generally invests in equity securities of established companies listed on foreign exchanges although the fund may also invest in securities traded over the counter which the advisor believes have favorable characteristics the funds equity investments include common stock convertible and nonconvertible preferred stock sponsored and unsponsored depository receipts and warrants when the advisor believes that it is appropriate to do so in order to achieve the funds investment objective of longterm capital growth the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities such debt securities include debt securities of governments governmental agencies supranational organizations and private issuers including bonds denominated in the european currency unit the euro portfolio debt investments will be selected on the basis of among other things yield credit quality and the fundamental outlooks for currency and interest rate trends in different parts of the globe taking into account the ability to hedge a degree of currency or local bond price risk the value of fixedincome investments will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and bond market conditions tending to rise as interest rates decline and decline as interest rates rise the fund will predominantly purchase investmentgrade bonds which are those rated aaa aa a or baa by moodys investors service inc or aaa aa a or bbb by standard  poors ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc or if unrated judged by the advisor to be of equivalent quality the fund may also invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade see risk factors the fund intends to diversify investments among several countries and normally to have investments in securities of at least three different countries other than the us the fund will invest primarily in securities of issuers in the  developed foreign countries included in the morgan stanley capital international msci europe australia far east eafe and canada index but may invest in emerging markets the fund considers emerging markets to include any country that is defined as an emerging or developing economy by any of the international bank of reconstruction and development ie the world bank the international finance corporation or the united nations or its authorities it is expected that the funds investments will include companies of varying size as measured by assets sales or market capitalization the major portion of the funds assets consists of equity securities of established companies listed on recognized exchanges the advisor expects this condition to continue although the fund may invest in other securities in selecting securities for the funds portfolio the advisor applies a disciplined multipart investment approach for selecting stocks for the fund in analyzing companies for investment the advisor ordinarily looks for one or more of the following characteristics strong competitive positioning aboveaverage earnings growth per share high return on invested capital healthy balance sheets and overall financial strength strength of management and general operating characteristics which will enable the companies to compete successfully in the marketplace the advisor will further seek to have broad country representation favoring those countries that it believes have sound economic conditions and open markets the advisor will also look for opportunities on a macroeconomic level seeking to identify major changes in the business environment and companies that are poised to benefit from these changes investment decisions are made without regard to arbitrary criteria as to minimum asset size debtequity ratios or dividend history of portfolio companies the advisor will typically sell an investment when certain criteria are met including but not limited to the price of the security reaches the advisors assessment of its fair value the underlying investment theme is judged by the advisor to have matured or if the original reason for investing in the security no longer applies or is no longer valid in applying the disciplined multipart investment approach for selecting stocks for the fund the advisor first analyzes the pool of foreign dividendpaying securities primarily from the worlds more mature markets and targeting stocks that have high relative yields compared to the average for their markets in the advisors opinion this group of higheryielding stocks offers the potential for returns that is greater than or equal to the average market return with price volatility that is lower than the overall market volatility the advisor believes that these potentially favorable risk and  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th return characteristics exist because the higher dividends offered by these stocks act as a cushion when markets are volatile and because the stocks with higher yields tend to have more attractive valuations eg lower pricetoearning ratios and lower pricetobook ratios the second stage of portfolio construction involves a fundamental analysis of each companys financial strength profitability projected earnings competitive positioning and ability of management during this step the advisors research team identifies what it believes are the most promising stocks for the funds portfolio the third stage of the investment process involves diversifying the portfolio among different industry sectors the key element of this stage is evaluating how the stocks in different sectors react to economic factors such as interest rates inflation gross domestic product and consumer spending and then attaining a proper balance of stocks in these sectors based on the advisors economic forecast the fourth and final stage of this ongoing process is diversifying the portfolio among different countries the advisor will seek to have broad country representation favoring those countries that it believes have sound economic conditions and open markets the funds strategy is to manage risk and create opportunity at each of the four stages in its investment process starting with the focus on stocks with high relative yields the fund may hold up to  of its net assets in us and foreign fixed income securities for temporary defensive purposes when the advisor believes that market conditions so warrant the fund may invest up to  of its net assets under normal conditions and without limit for temporary defensive purposes in cash or cash equivalents including domestic and foreign money market instruments shortterm government and corporate obligations and repurchase agreements when the advisor deems such a position advisable in light of economic or market conditions it is impossible to predict how long alternative strategies may be utilized in addition the fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements illiquid securities and strategic transactions which may include derivatives foreign securities such as those purchased by the fund may be subject to foreign governmental taxes which could reduce the yield on such securities although a shareholder of the fund may subject to certain limitations be entitled to claim a credit or deduction for us federal income tax purposes for his or her proportionate share of such foreign taxes paid by the fund from time to time the fund may be a purchaser of illiquid securities such as restricted debt or equity securities ie securities which may require registration under the securities act of  as amended the  act or an exemption therefrom in order to be sold in the ordinary course of business in a private placement see illiquid securities and restricted securities  the fund cannot guarantee a gain or eliminate the risk of loss the net asset value of the funds shares will increase or decrease with changes in the market price of the funds investments and there is no assurance that the funds objectives will be achieved masterfeeder structure the boards of directors has the discretion to retain the current distribution arrangements for the funds while investing in a master fund in a masterfeeder fund structure as described below a masterfeeder fund structure is one in which a fund a feeder fund instead of investing directly in a portfolio of securities invests most or all of its investment assets in a separate registered investment company the master fund with substantially the same investment objective and policies as the feeder fund such a structure permits the pooling of assets of two or more feeder funds preserving separate identities or distribution channels at the feeder fund level based on the premise that certain of the expenses of operating an investment portfolio are relatively fixed a larger investment portfolio may eventually achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average net assets an existing investment company is able to convert to a feeder fund by selling all of its investments which involves brokerage and other transaction costs and realization of a taxable gain or loss or by contributing its assets to the master fund and avoiding transaction costs and if proper procedures are followed the realization of taxable gain or loss borrowing each fund may not borrow money except as permitted under federal law each fund will borrow only when the advisor believes that borrowing will benefit the fund after taking into account considerations such as the costs of the borrowing each fund does not expect to borrow for investment purposes to increase return or leverage the portfolio borrowing by a fund will involve special risk considerations although the principal of each funds borrowings will be fixed the funds assets may change in value during the time a borrowing is outstanding thus increasing exposure to capital risk common stocks under normal circumstances each fund invests primarily in common stocks common stock is issued by each company to raise cash for business purposes and represents a proportionate interest in the issuing companies therefore each fund participates in the success or failure of any company in which it holds stock the  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th market values of common stock can fluctuate significantly reflecting the business performance of the issuing company investor perception and general economic or financial market movements smaller companies are especially sensitive to these factors and may even become valueless despite the risk of price volatility however common stock also offers greater potential for longterm gain on investment compared to other classes of financial assets such as bonds or cash equivalents convertible securities each fund may invest in convertible securities that is bonds notes debentures preferred stocks and other securities which are convertible into common stock investments in convertible securities can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation andor income through interest and dividend payments by virtue of their conversion or exchange features the convertible securities in which the funds may invest are either fixed income or zero coupon debt securities which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying shares of common stock the exchange ratio for any particular convertible security may be adjusted from time to time due to stock splits dividends spinoffs other corporate distributions or scheduled changes in the exchange ratio convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stocks until converted have general characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities although to a lesser extent than with debt securities generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely tends to increase as interest rates decline in addition because of the conversion or exchange feature the market value of convertible securities typically changes as the market value of the underlying common stocks changes and therefore also tends to follow movements in the general market for equity securities a unique feature of convertible securities is that as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the prices of the convertible securities tend to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock although typically not as much as the underlying common stock while no securities investments are without risk investments in convertible securities generally entail less risk than investments in common stock of the same issuer as debt securities convertible securities are investments which provide for a stream of income or in the case of zero coupon securities accretion of income with generally higher yields than common stocks of course like all debt securities there can be no assurance of income or principal payments because the issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations convertible securities generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality because of their conversion or exchange features convertible securities generally are subordinated to other similar but nonconvertible securities of the same issuer although convertible bonds as corporate debt obligations enjoy seniority in right of payment to all equity securities and convertible preferred stock is senior to common stock of the same issuer however because of the subordination feature convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock typically have lower ratings than similar nonconvertible securities convertible securities may be issued as fixed income obligations that pay current income or as zero coupon notes and bonds including liquid yield option notes lyonstm currency transactions each fund may engage in currency transactions with counterparties primarily in order to hedge or manage the risk of the value of portfolio holdings denominated in particular currencies against fluctuations in relative value currency transactions include forward currency contracts exchange listed currency futures exchange listed and otc options on currencies and currency swaps a forward currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows based on the notional difference among two or more currencies and operates similarly to an interest rate swap which is described below the fund may enter into currency transactions with counterparties which have received or the guarantors of the obligations which have received a credit rating of a or p by sp or moodys respectively or that have an equivalent rating from a nrsro or except for otc currency options are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor each funds dealings in forward currency contracts and other currency transactions such as futures options options on futures and swaps generally will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except as described below transaction hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of each fund which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of their portfolio securities or the receipt of income therefrom position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the funds generally will not enter into a transaction to hedge currency exposure to an extent greater after netting all transactions intended wholly or partially to offset other transactions than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the transaction of the securities held in its portfolio that are denominated or generally quoted in or currently convertible into such currency other than with respect to proxy hedging or cross hedging as described below the funds may also crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which a fund has or in which a fund expects to have portfolio exposure to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of portfolio securities the funds may also engage in proxy hedging proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which a funds portfolio is exposed is difficult to hedge or to hedge against the dollar proxy hedging entails entering into a commitment or option to sell a currency whose changes in value are generally considered to be correlated to a currency or currencies in which some or all of each funds portfolio securities are or are expected to be denominated in exchange for us dollars the amount of the commitment or option would not exceed the value of the funds securities denominated in correlated currencies for example if the advisor considers that the austrian schilling is correlated to the german deutschemark the dmark the fund holds securities denominated in schillings and the advisor believes that the value of schillings will decline against the us dollar the advisor may enter into a commitment or option to sell dmarks and buy dollars currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments currency transactions can result in losses to a fund if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further there is the risk that the perceived correlation between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time that a fund is engaging in proxy hedging if a fund enters into a currency hedging transaction the fund will comply with the asset segregation requirements described below risks of currency transactions currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses to a fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs buyers and sellers of currency futures are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures is relatively new and the ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid market which may not always be available currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that countrys economy debt securities global fund may not invest more than  of its total assets in debt securities that are rated baa or below by moodys or bbb or below by sp or deemed by the advisor to be of comparable quality when the advisor believes that it is appropriate to do so in order to achieve international funds objective of longterm capital growth the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities including bonds of foreign governments supranational organizations and private issuers including bonds denominated in the euro portfolio debt investments will be selected on the basis of among other things yield credit quality and the fundamental outlooks for currency economic and interest rate trends in different parts of the globe taking into account the ability to hedge a degree of currency or local bond price risk depository receipts international fund may invest sponsored or unsponsored american depository receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depository receipts gdrs international depository receipts idrs and other types of depository receipts which together with adrs gdrs and idrs are hereinafter referred to as depository receipts depositary receipts provide indirect investment in securities of foreign issuers prices of unsponsored depository receipts may be more volatile than if the issuer of the underlying securities sponsored them depository receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which they may be converted in addition the issuers of the stock of unsponsored depository receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the united states and therefore there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depository receipts adrs are depository receipts which are bought and sold in the united states and are typically issued by a us bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities by a foreign corporation gdrs idrs and other types of depository receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they may also be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation generally depository  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st receipts in registered form are designed for use in the united states securities markets and depository receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities markets outside the united states for purposes of the funds investment policies the funds investments in adrs gdrs and other types of depository receipts will be deemed to be investments in the underlying securities depository receipts including those denominated in us dollars will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk however by investing in us dollardenominated adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock the fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period in general there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs however certain depository receipts may not be listed on an exchange and therefore may be illiquid securities dollar roll transactions dollar roll transactions consist of the sale by a fund to a bank or brokerdealer the counterparty of gnma certificates or other mortgagebacked securities together with a commitment to purchase from the counterparty similar but not identical securities at a future date at the same price the counterparty receives all principal and interest payments including prepayments made on the security while it is the holder a fund receives a fee from the counterparty as consideration for entering into the commitment to purchase dollar rolls may be renewed over a period of several months with a different purchase and repurchase price fixed and a cash settlement made at each renewal without physical delivery of securities moreover the transaction may be preceded by a firm commitment agreement pursuant to which a fund agrees to buy a security on a future date each fund will segregate cash us government securities or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to meet their purchase obligations under the transactions the funds will also maintain asset coverage of at least  for all outstanding firm commitments dollar rolls and other borrowings dollar rolls may be treated for purposes of the of  act as amended as borrowings of each fund because they involve the sale of a security coupled with an agreement to repurchase a dollar roll involves costs to the fund for example while a fund receives a fee as consideration for agreeing to repurchase the security the fund forgoes the right to receive all principal and interest payments while the counterparty holds the security these payments to the counterparty may exceed the fee received by the fund thereby effectively charging the fund interest on its borrowing further although a fund can estimate the amount of expected principal prepayment over the term of the dollar roll a variation in the actual amount of prepayment could increase or decrease the cost of the funds borrowing the entry into dollar rolls involves potential risks of loss that are different from those related to the securities underlying the transactions for example if the counterparty becomes insolvent a funds right to purchase from the counterparty might be restricted additionally the value of such securities may change adversely before a fund is able to purchase them similarly a fund may be required to purchase securities in connection with a dollar roll at a higher price than may otherwise be available on the open market since as noted above the counterparty is required to deliver a similar but not identical security to a fund the security that the fund is required to buy under the dollar roll may be worth less than an identical security finally there can be no assurance that each funds use of the cash that it receives from a dollar roll will provide a return that exceeds borrowing costs eurodollar instruments the funds may make investments in eurodollar instruments eurodollar instruments are us dollardenominated futures contracts or options thereon which are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor although foreign currencydenominated instruments are available from time to time eurodollar futures contracts enable purchasers to obtain a fixed rate for the lending of funds and sellers to obtain a fixed rate for borrowings the fund might use eurodollar futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in libor to which many interest rate swaps and fixed income instruments are linked foreign currencies because investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries and because the funds may hold foreign currencies and forward contracts futures contracts and options on foreign currencies and foreign currency futures contracts the value of the assets of the funds as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the funds may incur costs and experience conversion difficulties and uncertainties in connection with conversions between various currencies in particular each funds foreign investments are generally denominated in foreign currencies the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies is responsible for part of each funds investment performance if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen for example the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall in addition many foreign currencies have experienced significant devaluation relative to the dollar although each fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to each fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer each fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into options or forward or futures contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies foreign investment risk while each fund offers the potential for substantial appreciation over time it also involves aboveaverage investment risk in comparison to a mutual fund investing in a broad range of us equity securities each fund is designed as a longterm investment and not for shortterm trading purposes each fund together should be considered a complete investment program although each could serve as a core international holding for an individuals portfolio each funds net asset value or price can fluctuate significantly with changes in stock market levels political developments movements in currencies global investment flows and other factors foreign securities investing in foreign securities involves certain special considerations including those set forth below which are not typically associated with investing in us securities and which may favorably or unfavorably affect the funds performance as foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic companies there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than about a domestic company many foreign securities markets while growing in volume of trading activity have substantially less volume than the us market and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of domestic issuers similarly volume and liquidity in most foreign bond markets is less than in the us and at times volatility of price can be greater than in the us fixed commissions on some foreign securities exchanges and bid to asked spreads in foreign bond markets are generally higher than commissions or bid to asked spreads on us markets although the advisor will endeavor to achieve the most favorable net results on its portfolio transactions there is generally less governmental supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed companies in foreign countries than in the us it may be more difficult for the funds agents to keep currently informed about corporate actions in foreign countries which may affect the prices of portfolio securities communications between the us and foreign countries may be less reliable than within the us thus increasing the risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for portfolio securities payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect us investments in those countries moreover individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position the management of the funds seeks to mitigate the risks associated with the foregoing considerations through continuous professional management high yieldhigh risk bonds the funds may also purchase to a limited extent debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities which usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk of principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the higher rating categories the lower the ratings of such debt securities the greater their risks render them like equity securities international fund will invest no more than  of its total assets in securities rated bb or lower by moodys or ba by sp and may invest in securities which are rated d by sp see the appendix to this statement of additional information for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations and their respective characteristics high yield highrisk securities are especially subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions to changes in the financial condition of their issuers and to price fluctuations in response to changes in interest rates an economic downturn could disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers to repay principal and interest also an increase in interest rates would have a greater adverse impact on the value of such obligations than on higher quality debt securities during an economic downturn or period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issues may experience financial stress which would adversely affect their ability to service their principal and interest payment obligations prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd the trading market for high yield securities may be thin to the extent that there is no established retail secondary market a thin trading market may limit the ability of a fund to accurately value high yield securities in its portfolio and to dispose of those securities adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of a funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of the fund to retain or dispose of such security prices for below investmentgrade securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments for example new federal rules require savings and loan institutions to gradually reduce their holdings of this type of security congress has from time to time considered legislation which would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in these securities and regulate corporate restructurings such legislation may significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type illiquid securities and restricted securities each fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i only to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid each funds board has approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirement that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities each fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses each fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the securities act of  as amended when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event each fund may be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading each fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them each fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between each funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which each fund is permitted or able to sell such security each fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell this investment practice therefore could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity of each fund interfund borrowing and lending program the funds have received exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission the sec that permits the funds to participate in an interfund borrowing and lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent each fund is actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund borrowing and lending program the fund as a matter of nonfundamental policy may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that the fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose investing in emerging markets the funds investments in foreign securities may be in developed countries or in countries considered by the funds advisor to have developing or emerging markets which involves exposure to economic structures that are generally less diverse and mature than in the united states and to political systems that may be less stable a developing or emerging market country can be considered to be a country that is in the initial stages of its industrialization cycle currently emerging markets generally include every country in the world other than the united states canada japan australia new zealand hong kong singapore and most western european countries currently investing in many emerging markets may not be desirable or feasible because of the lack of adequate custody arrangements for the funds assets overly burdensome repatriation and similar restrictions the lack of organized and liquid securities markets unacceptable political risks or other reasons as opportunities to invest in securities in emerging markets develop the funds may expand and further broaden the group of emerging markets in which it invests in the past markets of developing or emerging market countries have been more volatile than the markets of developed countries however such markets often have provided higher rates of return to investors the advisor believes that these characteristics may be expected to continue in the future most emerging securities markets may have substantially less volume and are subject to less governmental supervision than us securities markets securities of many issuers in emerging markets may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers in addition there is less regulation of securities exchanges securities dealers and listed and unlisted companies in emerging markets than in the us emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have not kept pace with the volume of securities transactions delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when a portion of the assets of the fund is uninvested and no cash is earned thereon the inability of the fund to make intended security purchases due to settlement problems could cause the fund to miss attractive investment opportunities inability to dispose of portfolio securities due to settlement problems could result either in losses to the fund due to subsequent declines in value of the portfolio security or if the fund has entered into a contract to sell the security could result in possible liability to the purchaser costs associated with transactions in foreign securities are generally higher than costs associated with transactions in us securities such transactions also involve additional costs for the purchase or sale of foreign currency certain emerging markets require prior governmental approval of investments by foreign persons limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular company limit the investment by foreign persons only to a specific class of securities of a company that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domiciliaries of the countries andor impose additional taxes on foreign investors certain emerging markets may also restrict investment opportunities in issuers in industries deemed important to national interest certain emerging markets may require governmental approval for the repatriation of investment income capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors in addition if a deterioration occurs in an emerging markets balance of payments or for other reasons a country could impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances the fund could be adversely affected by delays in or a refusal to grant any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital as well as by the application to the fund of any restrictions on investments in the course of investment in emerging markets the fund will be exposed to the direct or indirect consequences of political social and economic changes in one or more emerging markets while the fund will manage its assets in a manner that will seek to minimize the exposure to such risks there can be no assurance that adverse political social or economic changes will not cause the fund to suffer a loss of value in respect of the securities in the funds portfolio  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the risk also exists that an emergency situation may arise in one or more emerging markets as a result of which trading of securities may cease or may be substantially curtailed and prices for the funds securities in such markets may not be readily available the corporation may suspend redemption of its shares for any period during which an emergency exists as determined by the sec accordingly if the fund believes that appropriate circumstances exist it will promptly apply to the sec for a determination that an emergency is present during the period commencing from the funds identification of such condition until the date of the sec action the funds securities in the affected markets will be valued at fair value determined in good faith by or under the direction of the corporations board of directors volume and liquidity in most foreign markets are less than in the us and securities of many foreign companies are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable us companies fixed commissions on foreign securities exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on us exchanges although the fund endeavors to achieve the most favorable net results on its portfolio transactions there is generally less governmental supervision and regulation of business and industry practices securities exchanges brokers dealers and listed companies than in the us mail service between the us and foreign countries may be slower or less reliable than within the us thus increasing the risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for certificated portfolio securities in addition with respect to certain emerging markets there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect the funds investments in those countries moreover individual emerging market economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position the fund may have limited legal recourse in the event of a default with respect to certain debt obligations it holds if the issuer of a fixedincome security owned by the fund defaults the fund may incur additional expenses to seek recovery debt obligations issued by emerging market country governments differ from debt obligations of private entities remedies from defaults on debt obligations issued by emerging market governments unlike those on private debt must be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party itself the funds ability to enforce its rights against private issuers may be limited the ability to attach assets to enforce a judgment may be limited legal recourse is therefore somewhat diminished bankruptcy moratorium and other similar laws applicable to private issuers of debt obligations may be substantially different from those of other countries the political context expressed as an emerging market governmental issuers willingness to meet the terms of the debt obligation for example is of considerable importance in addition no assurance can be given that the holders of commercial bank debt may not contest payments to the holders of debt obligations in the event of default under commercial bank loan agreements income from securities held by the fund could be reduced by a withholding tax at the source or other taxes imposed by the emerging market countries in which the fund makes its investments the funds net asset value may also be affected by changes in the rates or methods of taxation applicable to the fund or to entities in which the fund has invested the advisor will consider the cost of any taxes in determining whether to acquire any particular investments but can provide no assurance that the taxes will not be subject to change many emerging markets have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation for many years inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries in an attempt to control inflation wage and price controls have been imposed in certain countries of these countries some in recent years have begun to control inflation through prudent economic policies emerging market governmental issuers are among the largest debtors to commercial banks foreign governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions certain emerging market governmental issuers have not been able to make payments of interest on or principal of debt obligations as those payments have come due obligations arising from past restructuring agreements may affect the economic performance and political and social stability of those issuers governments of many emerging market countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector through the ownership or control of many companies including some of the largest in any given country as a result government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in emerging markets which in turn may adversely affect companies in the private sector general market conditions and prices and yields of certain of the securities in the funds portfolio expropriation confiscatory taxation nationalization political economic or social instability or other similar developments have occurred frequently over the history of certain emerging markets and could adversely affect the funds assets should these conditions recur  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the ability of emerging market country governmental issuers to make timely payments on their obligations is likely to be influenced strongly by the issuers balance of payments including export performance and its access to international credits and investments an emerging market whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities could be vulnerable to a decline in the international prices of one or more of those commodities increased protectionism on the part of an emerging markets trading partners could also adversely affect the countrys exports and diminish its trade account surplus if any to the extent that emerging markets receive payment for its exports in currencies other than dollars or nonemerging market currencies its ability to make debt payments denominated in dollars or nonemerging market currencies could be affected another factor bearing on the ability of emerging market countries to repay debt obligations is the level of international reserves of the country fluctuations in the level of these reserves affect the amount of foreign exchange readily available for external debt payments and thus could have a bearing on the capacity of emerging market countries to make payments on these debt obligations to the extent that an emerging market country cannot generate a trade surplus it must depend on continuing loans from foreign governments multilateral organizations or private commercial banks aid payments from foreign governments and inflows of foreign investment the access of emerging markets to these forms of external funding may not be certain and a withdrawal of external funding could adversely affect the capacity of emerging market country governmental issuers to make payments on their obligations in addition the cost of servicing emerging market debt obligations can be affected by a change in international interest rates since the majority of these obligations carry interest rates that are adjusted periodically based upon international rates investment company securities each fund may acquire securities of other investment companies to the extent consistent with its investment objective and subject to the limitations of the  act each fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees and other expenses paid by such other investment companies for example a fund may invest in a variety of investment companies which seek to track the composition and performance of specific indexes or a specific portion of an index these indexbased investments hold substantially all of their assets in securities representing their specific index accordingly the main risk of investing in indexbased investments is the same as investing in a portfolio of equity securities comprising the index the market prices of indexbased investments will fluctuate in accordance with both changes in the market value of their underlying portfolio securities and due to supply and demand for the instruments on the exchanges on which they are traded which may result in their trading at a discount or premium to their navs indexbased investments may not replicate exactly the performance of their specified index because of

the central funds in excess of the limitations of section d of the  act investment by the fund in shares of the central funds will be in accordance with the funds investment policies and restrictions as set forth in its registration statement certain of the central funds comply with rule a under the  act the other central funds are or will be shortterm bond funds that invest in fixedincome securities and maintain a dollar weighted average maturity of three years or less each of the central funds will be managed specifically to maintain a highly liquid portfolio and access to them will enhance the funds ability to manage uninvested cash each fund will invest uninvested cash in central funds only to the extent that each funds aggregate investment in the central funds does not exceed  of its total assets in shares of the central funds purchase and sales of shares of central funds are made at net asset value lending of portfolio securities each fund may seek to increase its income by lending portfolio securities such loans may be made to registered brokerdealers or other financial institutions and are required to be secured continuously by collateral in cash or liquid assets maintained on a current basis at an amount at least equal to the market value and accrued interest of the securities loaned each fund has the right to call a loan and obtain the securities loaned on five days notice or in connection with securities trading on foreign markets within such longer period of time which coincides with the normal settlement period for purchases and sales of such securities in such foreign markets during the existence of a loan each fund continues to receive the equivalent of any distributions paid by the issuer on the securities loaned and also receives compensation based on investment of the collateral the risks in lending securities as with other extensions of secured credit consist of a possible delay in recovery and a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially loans may be made only to firms deemed by the advisor to be of good standing and will not be made unless in the judgment of the advisor the consideration to be earned from such loans would justify the risk real estate investment trusts reits global fund may invest in reits reits are sometimes informally characterized as equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits investment in reits may subject the fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate such as decreases in real estate values overbuilding increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions increases in operating costs and property taxes changes in zoning laws casualty or condemnation losses possible environmental liabilities regulatory limitations on rent and fluctuations in rental income equity reits generally experience these risks directly through fee or leasehold interests whereas mortgage reits generally experience these risks indirectly through mortgage interests unless the  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th mortgage reit forecloses on the underlying real estate changes in interest rates may also affect the value of the funds investment in reits for instance during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those reits certain reits have relatively small market capitalizations which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of their securities furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills have limited diversification and are therefore subject to risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the internal revenue code of  as amended and to maintain exemption from the registration requirements of the  act by investing in reits indirectly through a fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the funds but also indirectly similar expenses of the reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders repurchase agreements each fund may invest in repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement a fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer some repurchase commitment transactions may not provide a fund with collateral markedtomarket during the term of the commitment a repurchase agreement provides a means for a fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie a fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and the value of such securities kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to a fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to the fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case the income to a fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by a fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by a fund or as being collateral for a loan by a fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement the fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation a fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor a fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt instrument purchased for a fund the advisor seeks to minimize the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case a fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to a fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value of the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest a fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price it is possible that the fund will be unsuccessful in seeking to enforce the sellers contractual obligation to deliver additional securities reverse repurchase agreements each fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which a fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase them at an agreed upon time and price each fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements are deemed to be borrowings subject to each funds investment restrictions applicable to that activity each fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuation in the market value of fund assets and their yields trust preferred securities each fund may invest in trust preferred securities which are hybrid instruments issued by a special purpose trust the special trust the entire equity interest of which is owned by a single issuer the proceeds of the issuance to a fund of trust preferred securities are typically used to purchase a junior subordinated debenture and distributions from the special trust are funded by the payments of principal and interest on the subordinated debenture  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th if payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures held by the special trust are deferred by the debenture issuer the debentures would be treated as original issue discount oid obligations for the remainder of their term as a result holders of trust preferred securities such as the fund would be required to accrue daily for federal income tax purposes their share of the stated interest and the de minimis oid on the debentures regardless of whether the fund receives any cash distributions from the special trust and the value of trust preferred securities would likely be negatively affected interest payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures typically may only be deferred if dividends are suspended on both common and preferred stock of the issuer the underlying junior subordinated debentures generally rank slightly higher in terms of payment priority than both common and preferred securities of the issuer but rank below other subordinated debentures and debt securities trust preferred securities may be subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances the market values of trust preferred securities may be more volatile than those of conventional debt securities trust preferred securities may be issued in reliance on rule a under the  act and unless and until registered are restricted securities there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of trust preferred securities and the ability of holders of trust preferred securities such as the fund to sell their holdings warrants international fund may invest in warrants up to  of the value of its net assets the holder of a warrant has the right until the warrant expires to purchase a given number of shares of a particular issuer at a specified price such investments can provide a greater potential for profit or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security prices of warrants do not necessarily move in tandem with the prices of the underlying securities however and are therefore considered speculative investments warrants pay no dividends and confer no rights other than a purchase option thus if a warrant held by the fund were not exercised by the date of its expiration the fund would lose the entire purchase price of the warrant whenissued securities each fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the whenissued or forward delivery securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund to the extent that assets of the fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities the fund would earn no income however it is each funds intention to be fully invested to the extent practicable and subject to the policies stated above while whenissued or forward delivery securities may be sold prior to the settlement date each fund intends to purchase such securities with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time a fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on a whenissued or forward delivery basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the whenissued or forward delivery securities may be more or less than the purchase price each fund does not believe that its net asset value or income will be adversely affected by its purchase of securities on a whenissued or forward delivery basis zero coupon securities global fund may invest in zero coupon securities which pay no cash income and are sold at substantial discounts from their value at maturity when held to maturity their entire income which consists of accretion of discount comes from the difference between the issue price and their value at maturity zero coupon securities are subject to greater market value fluctuations from changing interest rates than debt obligations of comparable maturities which make current distributions of interest cash zero coupon securities which are convertible into common stock offer the opportunity for capital appreciation as increases or decreases in market value of such securities closely follows the movements in the market value of the underlying common stock zero coupon convertible securities generally are expected to be less volatile than the underlying common stocks as they usually are issued with maturities of  years or less and are issued with options andor redemption features exercisable by the holder of the obligation entitling the holder to redeem the obligation and receive a defined cash payment zero coupon securities include securities issued directly by the us treasury and us treasury bonds or notes and their unmatured interest coupons and receipts for their underlying principal coupons which have been separated by their holder typically a custodian bank or investment brokerage firm a holder will separate the interest coupons from the underlying principal the corpus of the us treasury security a number of securities firms and banks have stripped the interest coupons and receipts and then resold them in custodial receipt programs with a number of different names including treasury income growth receipts tigrstm and certificate of accrual on treasuries catstm the underlying us treasury bonds and notes themselves are held in bookentry form at the federal reserve bank or in the case of bearer securities ie unregistered securities which are owned ostensibly by the bearer or holder thereof in trust on behalf of the owners thereof counsel to the underwriters of these certificates or other evidences of ownership of the us treasury securities have stated that for federal tax and securities purposes in their opinion purchasers of such certificates such as the fund most likely will be deemed the beneficial holder of the underlying us government  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th securities the fund understands that the staff of the division of investment management of the sec no longer considers such privately stripped obligations to be us government securities as defined in the  act therefore the fund intends to adhere to this staff position and will not treat such privately stripped obligations to be us government securities for the purpose of determining if the fund is diversified under the  act the us treasury has facilitated transfers of ownership of zero coupon securities by accounting separately for the beneficial ownership of particular interest coupon and corpus payments on treasury securities through the federal reserve bookentry record keeping system the federal reserve program as established by the treasury department is known as strips or separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities under the strips program the fund will be able to have its beneficial ownership of zero coupon securities recorded directly in the bookentry recordkeeping system in lieu of having to hold certificates or other evidences of ownership of the underlying us treasury securities when us treasury obligations have been stripped of their unmatured interest coupons by the holder the principal or corpus is sold at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a future fixed payment on the security and does not receive any rights to periodic interest cash payments once stripped or separated the corpus and coupons may be sold separately typically the coupons are sold separately or grouped with other coupons with like maturity dates and sold bundled in such form purchasers of stripped obligations acquire in effect discount obligations that are economically identical to the zero coupon securities that the treasury sells itself strategic transactions and derivatives each fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of fixedincome securities in each funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies the fund may purchase and sell exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity and fixedincome indices and other instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors collars currency forward contracts currency futures contracts currency swaps or options on currencies or currency futures and various other currency transactions collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include new techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit subject to certain limitations imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for a funds portfolio resulting from securities markets or currency exchange rate fluctuations to protect a funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of fixedincome securities in a funds portfolio or to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of a funds assets will be committed to strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of a fund to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured each fund will comply with applicable regulatory requirements when implementing these strategies techniques and instruments strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of a fund and the fund will segregate assets or as provided by applicable regulations enter into certain offsetting positions to cover its obligations under options futures and swaps to limit leveraging of a fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation a fund can realize on its investments or cause a fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in a fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of a funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st have no markets as a result in certain markets a fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchases of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance a funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving a fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price the funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect the fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto each fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties each fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting the fund to  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd require the counterparty to sell the option back to a fund at a formula price within seven days each fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although they are not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with a fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option a fund will lose any premium they paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied each fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or in the case of otc currency transactions are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by the fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to the funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if a fund sells a call option the premium that they receive may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in their portfolio or will increase the funds income the sale of put options can also provide income each fund may purchase and sell call options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts all calls sold by the fund must be covered ie the fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect them against loss a call sold by a fund exposes the fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require the fund to hold a security or instrument which they might otherwise have sold each fund may purchase and sell put options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments whether or not they hold the above securities in their portfolios and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities each fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of a funds assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that a fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures each fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate currency or equity market changes and for duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by a fund as seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position each funds use of futures and options thereon will in all cases be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and in particular the rules and regulations of the commodity futures trading commission and will be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires a fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the mark to  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of the fund if the fund exercises an option on a futures contract they will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as they would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur each fund will not enter into a futures contract or related option except for closing transactions if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of its initial margin and premiums on open futures contracts and options thereon would exceed  of a funds total assets taken at current value however in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of the purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation the segregation requirements with respect to futures contracts and options thereon are described below options on securities indices and other financial indices each fund also may purchase and sell call and put options on securities indices and other financial indices and in so doing can achieve many of the same objectives it would achieve through the sale or purchase of options on individual securities or other instruments options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option on an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making up the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities risks of strategic transactions outside the us when conducted outside the us strategic transactions may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in a funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity combined transactions each fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single strategic transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the advisor it is in the best interests of that fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisors judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which the funds may enter are interest rate currency index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars the fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of securities the funds anticipate purchasing at a later date the funds will not sell interest rate caps or floors where they do not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by a fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values a fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with the fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments inasmuch as a fund will segregate assets or enter into offsetting positions to cover their obligations under swaps the advisor and the fund believes such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the  act and accordingly will not treat them as being subject to their borrowing restrictions a fund will not enter into any swap cap floor or collar transaction unless at the time of entering into such transaction the unsecured longterm debt of the counterparty combined with any credit enhancements is rated at least a by sp or moodys or has an equivalent rating from a nrsro or is determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor if there is a default by the counterparty a fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction the swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation as a result the swap market has become relatively liquid caps floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully developed and accordingly they are less liquid than swaps use of segregated and other special accounts many strategic transactions in addition to other requirements require that a fund segregate cash or liquid assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by the fund to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid assets at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by a fund will require the fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by a fund on an index will require the fund to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by a fund requires the fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price except when a fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency which requires no segregation a currency contract which obligates a fund to buy or sell currency will generally require the fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid assets denominated in that currency equal to the funds obligations or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the amount of the funds obligation otc options entered into by a fund including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when a fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by a fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when a fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price a fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by a fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and the fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon a fund must deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition to segregating cash or liquid assets sufficient to meet their obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such liquid assets may consist of cash cash equivalents liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps a fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of their obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars require segregation of assets with a value equal to a funds net obligation if any  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies a fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and strategic transactions for example a fund could purchase a put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by a fund moreover instead of segregating cash or liquid assets if a fund held a futures or forward contract it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held other strategic transactions may also be offset in combinations if the offsetting transaction terminates at the time of or after the primary transaction no segregation is required but if it terminates prior to such time cash or liquid assets equal to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated each funds activities involving strategic transactions may be limited by the requirements of subchapter m of the internal

nevertheless be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above even though from an investment standpoint it may constitute a partial return of capital in particular investors should consider the tax implications of buying shares just prior to a distribution the price of shares purchased at that time includes the amount of the forthcoming distribution those

subsequently acquires shares in the fund or another regulated investment company and the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced under a reinvestment right received upon the initial purchase of

purchased by a fund will be subject to tax under section  of the code in general no loss will be recognized by a fund upon payment of a premium in connection with the purchase of a put or call option the character of any gain or loss recognized ie longterm or shortterm will generally depend in the case of a lapse or sale of the option on the funds holding period for the option and in the case of the exercise of a put option on the funds holding period for the underlying property the purchase of a put option may constitute a short sale for federal income tax purposes causing an adjustment in the holding period of any stock in a funds portfolio similar to the stocks on which the index is based if a fund writes an option no gain is recognized upon its receipt of a premium if the option lapses or is closed out any gain or loss is treated as shortterm capital gain or loss if a call option is exercised the character of the gain or loss depends on the holding period of the underlying stock positions of a fund which consist of at least one stock and at least one stock option or other position with respect to a related security which substantially diminishes the funds risk of loss with respect to such stock could be treated as a straddle which is governed by section  of the code the operation of which may cause deferral of losses adjustments in the holding periods of stocks or securities and conversion of shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses an exception to these straddle rules exists for certain qualified covered call options on stock written by a fund many futures and forward contracts entered into by a fund and listed nonequity options written or purchased by the fund including options on debt securities options on futures contracts options on securities indices and options on currencies will be governed by section  of the code absent a tax election to the contrary gain or loss attributable to the lapse exercise or closing out of any such

instruments a transaction during the tax year that would otherwise be a constructive sale may be disregarded if  the transaction is closed by the th day after the close of the tax year and  the taxpayer holds the appreciated financial position without reduction of risk of loss throughout the day period following the date of closing of the transaction similarly if a fund enters into a short

transactions with respect to property that becomes substantially worthless under the code gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates which occur between the time a fund accrues receivables or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time the fund actually collects such receivables or pays such liabilities generally are treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss

allocated to any taxable year of the fund other than the taxable year of the excess distribution or disposition would be taxed to the fund at the highest ordinary income rate in effect for such year and the tax would be further increased by an interest charge to reflect the value of the tax deferral deemed to have resulted from the ownership of the foreign companys stock any amount of distribution or gain allocated to the taxable year of the distribution or disposition would be included in the funds investment company taxable income and accordingly would not be taxable to the fund to the extent distributed by the fund as a dividend to its shareholders each fund may make an election to mark to market its shares of these foreign investment companies in lieu of being subject to us federal income taxation at the end of each taxable year to which the election applies the fund would report as ordinary income the amount by which the fair market value of the foreign companys stock exceeds the funds adjusted basis in these shares any marktomarket losses and any loss from an actual disposition of shares would be reported as ordinary loss to the extent of any net marktomarket gains included in income in prior years the effect of the election would be to treat excess distributions and gain on dispositions as ordinary income which is not subject to a fund level tax when distributed to shareholders as a dividend alternatively each fund may elect to include as income and gain its share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of certain foreign investment

prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd appendix the following is a description of the ratings given by moodys and sp to corporate bonds ratings of corporate bonds sp debt rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by sp capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong debt rated aa has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differs from the highest rated issues only in small degree debt rated a has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories debt rated bbb is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories debt rated bb b ccc cc and c is regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such debt will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions debt rated bb has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments the bb rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bbb rating debt rated b has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to pay interest and repay principal the b rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bb or bb rating debt rated ccc has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions it is not likely to have the capacity to pay interest and repay principal the ccc rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied b or b rating the rating cc typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied ccc rating the rating c typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt which is assigned an actual or implied ccc debt rating the c rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed but debt service payments are continued the rating c is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being paid debt rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period had not expired unless sp believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are jeopardized moodys bonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well bonds which are rated ba are judged to have  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class bonds which are rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small bonds which are rated caa are of poor standing such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest bonds which are rated ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings bonds which are rated c are the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor

outside the united states the fund generally invests in equity securities of established companies listed on foreign exchanges although the fund may invest in securities traded over the counter which the advisor believes have favorable characteristics the funds  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th equity investments include common stock convertible and nonconvertible preferred stock sponsored and unsponsored depository receipts and warrants when the advisor believes that it is appropriate to do so in order to achieve the funds investment objective of longterm capital growth the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities such debt securities include debt securities of governments governmental agencies supranational organizations and private issuers including bonds denominated in the european currency unit the euro portfolio debt investments will be selected on the basis of among other things yield credit quality and the fundamental outlooks for

fluctuate with changes in interest rates and bond market conditions tending to rise as interest rates decline and decline as interest rates rise the fund will predominantly purchase investmentgrade

judged by the advisor to be of equivalent quality the fund may also invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade see risk factors the fund intends to diversify investments among several countries and normally to have investments in securities of at least three different countries other than the us the fund will invest primarily in securities of issuers in the developed foreign countries included in the morgan stanley capital international msci europe australia far east eafe and canada index but may invest in emerging markets the fund considers emerging markets to include any country that is defined as an emerging or developing economy by any of the international bank of reconstruction and development ie the world bank the international finance corporation or the united nations or its authorities it is expected that the funds investments will include companies of varying size as measured by assets sales or market capitalization the major portion of the funds assets consists of equity securities of established companies listed on recognized exchanges the advisor expects this condition to continue although the fund may invest in other securities in selecting securities for the funds portfolio the advisor applies a disciplined multipart investment approach for selecting stocks for the fund in analyzing companies for investment the advisor ordinarily looks for one or more of the following characteristics strong competitive positioning aboveaverage earnings growth per share high return on invested capital healthy balance sheets and overall financial strength strength of management and general operating characteristics which will enable the companies to compete successfully in the marketplace the advisor will further seek to have broad country representation favoring those countries that it believes have sound economic conditions and open markets the advisor will also look for opportunities on a macroeconomic level seeking to identify major changes in the business environment and companies that are poised to benefit from these changes investment decisions are made without regard to arbitrary criteria as to minimum asset size debtequity ratios or dividend history of portfolio companies the advisor will typically sell an investment when certain criteria are met including but not limited to the price of the security reaches the advisors assessment of its fair value the underlying investment theme is judged by the advisor to have matured or if the original reason for investing in the security no longer applies or is no longer valid in applying the disciplined multipart investment approach for selecting stocks for the fund the advisor first analyzes the pool of foreign dividendpaying securities primarily from the worlds more mature markets and targeting stocks that have high relative yields compared to the average for their markets in the advisors opinion this group of higheryielding stocks offers the potential for returns that is greater than or equal to the average market return with price volatility that is lower than the overall market volatility the advisor believes that these potentially favorable risk and return characteristics exist because the higher dividends offered by these stocks act as a cushion when markets are volatile and because the stocks with higher yields tend to have more attractive valuations eg lower pricetoearning ratios and lower pricetobook ratios the second stage of portfolio construction involves a fundamental analysis of each companys financial strength profitability projected earnings competitive positioning and ability of management during this step the advisors research team identifies what it believes are the most promising stocks for the funds portfolio the third stage of the investment process involves diversifying the portfolio among different industry sectors the key element of this stage is evaluating how the stocks in different sectors react to economic factors such as interest rates inflation gross domestic product and consumer spending and then attaining a proper balance of stocks in these sectors based on the advisors economic forecast the fourth and final stage of this ongoing process is diversifying the portfolio among different countries the advisor will seek to have broad country representation favoring those countries that it believes have sound economic conditions and open markets the funds strategy is to manage risk and create opportunity at each of the four stages

temporary defensive purposes in cash or cash equivalents including domestic and foreign money market instruments shortterm government and corporate obligations and repurchase agreements when the advisor deems such a position advisable in light of economic or market conditions it is impossible to accurately predict how long such alternative strategies may be utilized in addition the fund may

illiquid securities and restricted securities the fund cannot guarantee a gain or eliminate the risk of loss the net asset value of the funds shares will increase or decrease with changes in the market price of the funds investments and there is no assurance that the funds objectives will be achieved masterfeeder structure the board of directors of the fund the board or the directors has the discretion to retain the current distribution arrangement for the fund while investing in a master fund in a masterfeeder fund structure as described below a masterfeeder fund structure is one in which a fund a feeder fund instead of investing directly in a portfolio of securities invests most or all of its investment assets in a separate registered investment company the master fund with substantially the same investment objective and policies as the feeder fund such a structure permits the pooling of assets of two or more feeder funds preserving separate identities or distribution channels at the feeder fund level based on the premise that certain of the expenses of operating an investment portfolio are relatively fixed a larger investment portfolio may eventually achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average net assets an existing investment company is able to convert to a feeder fund by selling all of its investments which involves brokerage and other transaction costs and realization of a taxable gain or loss or by contributing its assets to the master fund and avoiding transaction costs and if proper procedures are followed the realization of taxable gain or loss borrowing the fund will borrow only when the advisor believes that borrowing will benefit the fund after taking into account considerations such as the costs of the borrowing borrowing by the fund will involve special risk considerations although the principal of the funds borrowings will be fixed the funds assets may change in value during the time a borrowing is outstanding proportionately increasing exposure to capital risk common stocks common stock is issued by companies to raise cash for business purposes and represents a proportionate interest in the issuing companies therefore the fund participates in the success or failure of any company in which it holds stock the market values of common stock can fluctuate significantly reflecting the business performance of the issuing company investor perception and general economic and financial market movements despite the risk of price volatility however common stocks have historically offered a greater potential for longterm gain on investment compared to other classes of financial assets such as bonds or cash equivalents although there can be no assurance that this will be true in the future convertible securities the fund may invest in convertible securities that is bonds notes debentures preferred stocks and other securities which are convertible into common stock investments in convertible securities can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation andor income through interest and dividend payments by virtue of their conversion or exchange features the convertible securities in which the fund may invest are either fixed income or zero coupon debt securities which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying shares of common stock the exchange ratio for any particular convertible security may be adjusted from time to time due to stock splits dividends  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st spinoffs other corporate distributions or scheduled changes in the exchange ratio convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stocks until converted have general characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities although to a lesser extent than with debt securities generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely tends to increase as interest rates decline in addition because of the conversion or exchange feature the market value of convertible securities typically changes as the market value of the underlying common stocks changes and therefore also tends to follow movements in the general market for equity securities a unique feature of convertible securities is that as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the prices of the convertible securities tend to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock although typically not as much as the underlying common stock while no securities investments are without risk investments in convertible securities generally entail less risk than investments in common stock of the same issuer as debt securities convertible securities are investments which provide for a stream of income or in the case of zero coupon securities accretion of income with generally higher yields than common stocks convertible securities generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality because of their conversion or exchange features of course like all debt securities there can be no assurance of income or principal payments because the issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations convertible securities generally are subordinated to other similar but nonconvertible securities of the same issuer although convertible bonds as corporate debt obligations enjoy seniority in right of payment to all equity securities and convertible preferred stock is senior to common stock of the same issuer however because of the subordination feature convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock typically have lower ratings than similar nonconvertible securities convertible securities may be issued as fixed income obligations that pay current income or as zero coupon notes and bonds including liquid yield option notes lyonstm currency transactions the fund may engage in currency transactions with counterparties primarily in order to hedge or manage the risk of the value of portfolio holdings denominated in particular currencies against fluctuations in relative value currency transactions include forward currency contracts exchange listed currency futures exchange listed and otc options on currencies and currency swaps a forward currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows based on the notional difference among two or more currencies and operates similarly to an interest rate swap which is described below the fund may enter into currency transactions with counterparties which have received or the guarantors of the obligations which have received a credit rating of a or p by sp or moodys respectively or that have an equivalent rating from a nrsro or except for otc currency options are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the funds dealings in forward currency contracts and other currency transactions such as futures options options on futures and swaps generally will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except as described below transaction hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of the fund which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of income therefrom position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency the fund generally will not enter into a transaction to hedge currency exposure to an extent greater after netting all transactions intended wholly or partially to offset other transactions than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the transaction of the securities held in its portfolio that are denominated or generally quoted in or currently convertible into such currency other than with respect to proxy hedging or cross hedging as described below the fund may also crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which the fund has or in which the fund expects to have portfolio exposure  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of portfolio securities the fund may also engage in proxy hedging proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which the funds portfolio is exposed is difficult to hedge or to hedge against the dollar proxy hedging entails entering into a commitment or option to sell a currency whose changes in value are generally considered to be correlated to a currency or currencies in which some or all of the funds portfolio securities are or are expected to be denominated in exchange for us dollars the amount of the commitment or option would not exceed the value of the funds securities denominated in correlated currencies for example if the advisor considers that the austrian schilling is correlated to the german deutschemark the dmark the fund holds securities denominated in schillings and the advisor believes that the value of schillings will decline against the us dollar the advisor may enter into a commitment or option to sell dmarks and buy dollars currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments currency transactions can result in losses to the fund if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further there is the risk that the perceived correlation between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time that a fund is engaging in proxy hedging if a fund enters into a currency hedging transaction that fund will comply with the asset segregation requirements described below risks of currency transactions currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses to the fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs buyers and sellers of currency futures are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures is relatively new and the ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid market which may not always be available currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that countrys economy depositary receipts the fund may invest in sponsored or unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs international depositary receipts idrs and other types of depositary receipts which together with adrs gdrs and idrs are hereinafter referred to as depositary receipts depositary receipts provide indirect investment in securities of foreign issuers prices of unsponsored depositary receipts may be more volatile than if they were sponsored by the issuer of the underlying securities depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which they may be converted in addition the issuers of the stock of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the united states and therefore there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts adrs are depositary receipts which are bought and sold in the united states and are typically issued by a us bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities by a foreign corporation gdrs idrs and other types of depositary receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they may also be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation generally depositary receipts in registered form are designed for use in the united states securities markets and depositary receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities markets outside the united states for purposes of the funds investment policies the funds investments in adrs gdrs and other types of depositary receipts will be deemed to be investments in the underlying securities depositary receipts including those denominated in us dollars will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk however by investing in us dollardenominated adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock the fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period in general there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs however certain depositary receipts may not be listed on an exchange and therefore may be illiquid securities dollar roll transactions dollar roll transactions consist of the sale by the fund to a bank or brokerdealer the counterparty of gnma certificates or other mortgagebacked securities together with a commitment to purchase from the counterparty similar but not identical securities at a future date at the same price the counterparty receives all principal and interest payments including prepayments made on the security while it is the holder the fund receives a fee from the counterparty as consideration for entering into the commitment to purchase dollar rolls may be renewed over a period of several months with a different purchase and repurchase price fixed and a cash settlement made at each renewal without physical delivery of securities moreover the transaction may be preceded by a firm commitment agreement pursuant to which the fund agrees to buy a security on a future date  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd the fund will segregate cash us government securities or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to meet their purchase obligations under the transactions the fund will also maintain asset coverage of at least  for all outstanding firm commitments dollar rolls and other borrowings dollar rolls may be treated for purposes of the  act as borrowings of the fund because they involve the sale of a security coupled with an agreement to repurchase a dollar roll involves costs to the fund for example while the fund receives a fee as consideration for agreeing to repurchase the security the fund forgoes the right to receive all principal and interest payments while the counterparty holds the security these payments to the counterparty may exceed the fee received by the fund thereby effectively charging the fund interest on its borrowing further although the fund can estimate the amount of expected principal prepayment over the term of the dollar roll a variation in the actual amount of prepayment could increase or decrease the cost of the funds borrowing the entry into dollar rolls involves potential risks of loss that are different from those related to the securities underlying the transactions for example if the counterparty becomes insolvent the funds right to purchase from the counterparty might be restricted additionally the value of such securities may change adversely before the fund is able to purchase them similarly the fund may be required to purchase securities in connection with a dollar roll at a higher price than may otherwise be available on the open market since as noted above the counterparty is required to deliver a similar but not identical security to the fund the security that the fund is required to buy under the dollar roll may be worth less than an identical security finally there can be no assurance that the funds use of the cash that it receives from a dollar roll will provide a return that exceeds borrowing costs euro the implementation of the euro may result in uncertainties for european securities and the operation of the fund the euro was introduced on january   by eleven members countries of the european economic and monetary union emu implementation of the euro requires the redenomination of european debt and equity securities over a period of time which may result in various accounting differences andor tax treatments which would not otherwise occur additional questions are raised by the fact that certain other european community members including the united kingdom did not officially implement the euro on january   foreign currencies because investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries and because the fund may hold foreign currencies and forward contracts futures contracts and options on foreign currencies and foreign currency futures contracts the value of the assets of the fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs and experience conversion difficulties and uncertainties in connection with conversions between various currencies fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the earning power and asset value of the foreign entity issuing the security the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies is responsible for part of the funds investment performance if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen for example the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall many foreign currencies have experienced significant devaluation relative to the dollar although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer the fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into options or forward or futures contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies foreign investment risk while the fund offers the potential for substantial appreciation over time it also involves aboveaverage investment risk in comparison to a mutual fund investing in a broad range of us equity securities the fund is designed as a longterm investment and not for shortterm trading purposes the fund should not be considered a complete investment program although it could serve as a core international holding for an individuals portfolio the funds net asset value or price can fluctuate significantly with changes in stock market levels political developments movements in currencies global investment flows and other factors  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th foreign securities investing in foreign securities involves certain special considerations including those set forth below which are not typically associated with investing in us securities and which may favorably or unfavorably affect the funds performance as foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic companies there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than about a domestic company many foreign securities markets while growing in volume of trading activity have substantially less volume than the us market and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of domestic issuers similarly volume and liquidity in most foreign bond markets is less than in the us and at times volatility of price can be greater than in the us fixed commissions on some foreign securities exchanges and bid to asked spreads in foreign bond markets are generally higher than commissions or bid to asked spreads on us markets although the advisor will endeavor to achieve the most favorable net results on its portfolio transactions there is generally less governmental supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed companies in foreign countries than in the us it may be more difficult for the funds agents to keep currently informed about corporate actions in foreign countries which may affect the prices of portfolio securities communications between the us and foreign countries may be less reliable than within the us thus increasing the risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for portfolio securities payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect us investments in those countries moreover individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position the management of the fund seeks to mitigate the risks associated with the foregoing considerations through continuous professional management high yieldhigh risk bonds the fund may also purchase debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor these securities usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk to principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the higher rating categories the lower the ratings of such debt securities the more their risks render them like equity securities the fund will invest no more than  of its total assets in securities rated bb or lower by moodys or ba by sp and may invest in securities which are rated d by sp securities rated d may be in default with respect to payment of principal or interest see the appendix to this statement of additional information for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations and their respective characteristics issuers of such high yielding securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing therefore the risk associated with acquiring the securities of such issuers generally is greater than is the case with higher rated securities for example during an economic downturn or a sustained period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issuers of high yield securities may experience financial stress during such periods such issuers may not have sufficient revenues to meet their interest payment obligations the issuers ability to service its debt obligations may also be adversely affected by specific corporate developments or the issuers inability to meet specific projected business forecasts or the unavailability of additional financing the risk of loss from default by the issuer is significantly greater for the holders of high yield securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect the funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates the fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield high risk securities because they may have a thin trading market because not all dealers maintain markets in all high yield securities the fund anticipates that such securities could be sold only to a limited number of dealers or institutional investors the lack of a liquid secondary market may have an adverse effect on the market price and the funds ability to dispose of particular issues and may also make it more difficult for the fund to obtain accurate market quotations for purposes of valuing the funds assets market quotations generally are available on many high yield issues only from a limited number of dealers and may not necessarily represent firm bids of such dealers or prices for actual sales adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recentlyissued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is generally the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of the funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of the fund to retain or dispose of such security prices for below investmentgrade securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments also congress has from time to time considered legislation which would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in these securities and regulate corporate restructurings such legislation may significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type illiquid securities and restricted securities the fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i only to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid the funds board has approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirement that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities the fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses the fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the securities act of  as amended when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event the fund may be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading the fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them the fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between the funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which the fund is permitted or able to sell such security the fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell this investment practice therefore could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity of the fund interfund lending program the fund has received exemptive relief with the securities and exchange commission the sec that permits the fund to participate in an interfund lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the requested relief the interfund lending program would allow the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a fund would participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers

have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent the fund is actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund lending program the fund as a matter of nonfundamental policy may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that the fund may engage in reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose investment company securities the fund may acquire securities of other investment companies to the extent consistent with its investment objective and subject to the limitations of the  act the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees and other expenses paid by such other investment companies for example the fund may invest in a variety of investment companies which seek to track the composition and performance of specific indexes or a specific portion of an index these indexbased investments hold substantially all of their assets in securities representing their specific index accordingly the main risk of investing in indexbased investments is the same as investing in a portfolio of equity securities comprising the

developed countries or in countries considered by the funds advisor to have developing or emerging markets which involves exposure to economic structures that are generally less diverse and mature than in the united states and to political systems that may be less stable a developing or emerging market country can be considered to be a country that is in the initial stages of its industrialization cycle currently emerging markets generally include every country in the world other than the united states canada japan australia new zealand hong kong singapore and most western european countries currently investing in many emerging markets may not be desirable or feasible because of the lack of adequate custody arrangements for the funds assets overly burdensome

markets of developed countries however such markets often have provided higher rates of return to investors the advisor believes that these characteristics may be expected to continue in the future most emerging securities markets have substantially less volume and are subject to less governmental supervision than us securities markets securities of many issuers in emerging markets may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers in addition there is less regulation of securities exchanges securities dealers and listed and unlisted companies in emerging markets than in the us emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have not kept pace with the volume of securities transactions delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when a portion of the assets of the fund is uninvested and no return is earned thereon the inability of the fund to make intended security purchases due to settlement problems could cause the fund to miss attractive investment opportunities inability to dispose of portfolio securities due to settlement problems could result either in losses to the fund due to subsequent declines in value of the portfolio security or if the fund has entered into a contract to sell the security could result in possible liability to the purchaser costs associated with transactions in foreign securities are generally higher than costs associated with transactions in us securities such transactions also involve additional costs for the purchase or sale of foreign currency certain emerging markets require prior governmental approval of investments by foreign persons limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular company limit the investment by foreign persons only to a specific class  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th of securities of a company that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domiciliaries of the countries andor impose additional taxes on foreign investors certain emerging markets may also restrict investment opportunities in issuers in industries deemed important to national interest certain emerging markets may require governmental approval for the repatriation of investment income capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors in addition if a deterioration occurs in an emerging markets balance of payments or for other reasons a country could impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances the fund could be adversely affected by delays in or a refusal to grant any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital as well as by the application to the fund of any restrictions on investments in the course of investment in emerging markets the fund will be exposed to the direct or indirect consequences of political social and economic changes in one or more emerging markets while the fund will manage its assets in a manner that will seek to minimize the exposure to such risks there can be no assurance that adverse political social or economic changes will not cause the fund to suffer a loss of value in respect of the securities in the funds portfolio the risk also exists that an emergency situation may arise in one or more emerging markets as a result of which trading of securities may cease or may be substantially curtailed and prices for the funds securities in such markets may not be readily available the fund may suspend redemption of its shares for any period during which an emergency exists as determined by the securities and exchange commission accordingly if the fund believes that appropriate circumstances exist it will promptly apply to the securities and exchange commission for a determination that an emergency is present during the period commencing from the funds identification of such condition until the date of the securities and exchange commission action the funds securities in the affected markets will be valued at fair value determined in good faith by or under the direction of the funds board volume and liquidity in most

be slower or less reliable than within the us thus increasing the risk of delayed settlements of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for certificated portfolio securities in addition with respect to certain emerging markets there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect the funds investments in those countries moreover individual emerging market economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position the fund may have limited legal recourse in the event of a default with respect to certain debt obligations it holds if the issuer of a fixedincome security owned by the fund defaults the fund may incur additional expenses to seek recovery debt obligations issued by emerging market country governments differ from debt obligations of private entities remedies from defaults on debt obligations issued by emerging market governments unlike those on private debt must be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party itself the funds ability to enforce its rights against private issuers may be limited the ability to attach assets to enforce a judgment may be limited legal recourse is therefore somewhat diminished bankruptcy moratorium and other similar laws applicable to private issuers of debt obligations may be substantially different from those of other countries the political context expressed as an emerging market governmental issuers willingness to meet the terms of the debt obligation for example is of considerable importance in addition no assurance can be given that the holders of commercial bank debt may not contest payments to the holders of debt obligations in the event of default under commercial bank loan agreements income from securities held by the fund could be reduced by a withholding tax at the source or other taxes imposed by the emerging market countries in which the fund makes its investments the funds net asset value may also be affected by changes in the rates or methods of taxation applicable to the fund or to entities in which the fund has invested the advisor will consider the cost of any taxes in determining whether to acquire any particular investments but can provide no assurance that the taxes will not be subject to change many emerging markets have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation for many years inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries in an attempt to control inflation wage and price controls have  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th been imposed in certain countries of these countries some in recent years have begun to control inflation through prudent economic policies emerging market governmental issuers are among the largest debtors to commercial banks foreign governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions certain emerging market governmental issuers have not been able to make payments of interest on or principal of debt obligations as those payments have come due obligations arising from past restructuring agreements may affect the economic performance and political and social stability of those issuers governments of many emerging market countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector through the ownership or control of many companies including some of the largest in any given country as a result government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in emerging markets which in turn may adversely affect companies in the private sector general market conditions and prices and yields of certain of the securities in the funds portfolio expropriation confiscatory taxation nationalization political economic or social instability or other similar developments have occurred frequently over the history of certain emerging markets and could adversely affect the funds assets should these conditions recur the ability of emerging market country governmental issuers to make timely payments on their obligations is likely to be influenced strongly by the issuers balance of payments including export performance and its access to international credits and investments an emerging market whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities could be vulnerable to a decline in the international prices of one or more of those commodities increased protectionism on the part of an emerging markets trading partners could also adversely affect the countrys exports and diminish its trade account surplus if any to the extent that emerging markets receive payment for its exports in currencies other than dollars or nonemerging market currencies its ability to make debt payments denominated in dollars or nonemerging market currencies could be affected another factor bearing on the ability of emerging market countries to repay debt obligations is the level of international reserves of the country fluctuations in the level of these reserves affect the amount of foreign exchange readily available for external debt payments and thus could have a bearing on the capacity of emerging market countries to make payments on these debt obligations to the extent that an emerging market country cannot generate a trade surplus it must depend on continuing loans from foreign governments multilateral organizations or private commercial banks aid payments from foreign governments and inflows of foreign investment the access of emerging markets to these forms of external funding may not be certain and a withdrawal of external funding could adversely affect the capacity of emerging market country governmental issuers to make payments on their obligations in addition the cost of servicing emerging market debt obligations can be affected by a change in international interest rates since the majority of these obligations carry interest rates that are adjusted periodically based upon international rates lending of portfolio securities the fund may seek to increase its income by lending portfolio securities such loans may be made to registered brokerdealers or other financial institutions and are required to be secured continuously by collateral in cash or liquid assets maintained on a current basis at an amount at least equal to the market value and accrued interest of the securities loaned the fund has the right to call a loan and obtain the securities loaned on five days notice or in connection with securities trading on foreign markets within such longer period of time which coincides with the normal settlement period for purchases and sales of such securities in such foreign markets during the existence of a loan the fund continues to receive the equivalent of any distributions paid by the issuer on the securities loaned and also receives compensation based on investment of the collateral the risks in lending securities as with other extensions of secured credit consist of a possible delay in recovery and a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially loans may be made only to firms deemed by the advisor to be of good standing and will not be made unless in the judgment of the advisor the consideration to be earned from such loans would justify the risk repurchase agreements the fund may invest in repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement the fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer a repurchase agreement provides a means for the fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie the fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and as described in more detail below the value of such securities is kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to the fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to the fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case the income to the fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by the fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by the fund or as being collateral for a loan by the fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement the fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and the fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation the fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor the fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt obligation purchased for the fund the advisor seeks to reduce the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case the fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to the fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value including interest of the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest the fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value including interest of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price reverse repurchase agreements the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which the fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase such securities at an agreed time and price the fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and its yield trust preferred securities the fund may invest in trust preferred securities which are hybrid instruments issued by a special purpose trust the special trust the entire equity interest of which is owned by a single issuer the proceeds of the issuance to the fund of trust preferred securities are typically used to purchase a junior subordinated debenture and distributions from the special trust are funded by the payments of principal and interest on the subordinated debenture if payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures held by the special trust are deferred by the debenture issuer the debentures would be treated as original issue discount oid obligations for the remainder of their term as a result holders of trust preferred securities such as the fund would be required to accrue daily for federal income tax purposes their share of the stated interest and the de minimis oid on the debentures regardless of whether the fund receives any cash distributions from the special trust and the value of trust preferred securities would likely be negatively affected interest payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures typically may only be deferred if dividends are suspended on both common and preferred stock of the issuer the underlying junior subordinated debentures generally rank slightly higher in terms of payment priority than both common and preferred securities of the issuer but rank below other subordinated debentures and debt securities trust preferred securities may be subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances the market values of trust preferred securities may be more volatile than those of conventional debt securities trust preferred securities may be issued in reliance on rule a under the securities act of  and unless and until registered are restricted securities there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of trust preferred securities and the ability of holders of trust preferred securities such as the fund to sell their holdings warrants the fund may invest in warrants up to  of the value of its net assets the holder of a warrant has the right until the warrant expires to purchase a given number of shares of a particular issuer at a specified price such investments can provide a greater potential for profit or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security prices of warrants do not necessarily move however in tandem with the prices of the underlying securities and are therefore considered speculative investments warrants pay no dividends and confer no rights other than a purchase  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st option thus if a warrant held by the fund were not exercised by the date of its expiration the fund would lose the entire purchase price of the warrant whenissued securities the fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued delayed delivery or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund when the fund purchases such securities it immediately assumes the risks of ownership including the risk of price fluctuation failure to deliver a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment to the extent that assets of the fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities the fund would earn no income while such securities may be sold prior to the settlement date the fund intends to purchase them with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on this basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the securities may be more or less than the purchase price the fund will establish a segregated account in which it will maintain cash and liquid securities equal in value to commitments for such securities strategic transactions and derivatives the fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of fixedincome securities in the funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts such strategies are generally accepted as a part of modern portfolio management and are regularly utilized by many mutual funds and other institutional investors in the course of pursuing these investment strategies the fund may purchase and sell exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity and fixedincome indices and other instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors collars currency forward contracts currency futures contracts currency swaps or options on currencies or currency futures and various other currency transactions collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include new techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for the funds portfolio resulting from securities markets or currency exchange rate fluctuations to protect the funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of fixedincome securities in the funds portfolio or to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of the funds assets will be committed to strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of the fund to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the fund will comply with applicable regulatory requirements when implementing these strategies techniques and instruments strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of the fund and the fund will segregate assets or as provided by applicable regulations enter into certain offsetting positions to cover its obligations under options futures and swaps to limit leveraging of the fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to the fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on its investments or cause the fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in the fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of the fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd of the funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets the fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchases of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance the funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving the fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price the funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect the fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto the fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option the funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreements with the counterparties in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties the fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting the fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to the fund at a formula price within seven days the fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although it is not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with the fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option the fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied the fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or in the case of otc currency transactions are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by the fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of the funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to the funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if the fund sells a call option the premium that it receives may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in its portfolio or will increase the funds income the sale of put options can also provide income the fund may purchase and sell call options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts all calls sold by the fund must be covered ie the fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though the fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by the fund exposes the fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require the fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold the fund may purchase and sell put options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments whether or not it holds the above securities in its portfolio and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities the fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of the funds assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that the fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures the fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate currency or equity market changes and for duration management for risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the fund as seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position the funds use of futures and options thereon will in all cases be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and in particular the rules and regulations of the commodity futures trading commission and will be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio management and return enhancement  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires the fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the marked to market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of the fund if the fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur the fund will not enter into a futures contract or related option except for closing transactions if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of its initial margin and premiums on open futures contracts and options thereon would exceed  of the funds total assets taken at current value however in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of the purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation the segregation requirements with respect to futures contracts and options thereon are described below options on securities indices and other financial indices the fund also may purchase and sell call and put options on securities indices and other financial indices and in so doing can achieve many of the same objectives it would achieve through the sale or purchase of options on individual securities or other instruments options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option on an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making up the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities combined transactions the fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single strategic transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the advisor it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisors judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which the fund may enter are interest rate currency index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars the fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of securities the fund anticipates purchasing at a later date the fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with the fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments inasmuch as the fund will segregate assets or enter into any offsetting position to cover its obligations under swaps the advisor and the fund believe such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the  act and accordingly will not treat them as being subject to its borrowing restrictions the fund will not enter into any swap cap floor or collar transaction unless at the time of entering into such transaction the unsecured longterm debt of the counterparty combined with any credit enhancements is rated at least a by sp or moodys or has an equivalent rating from a nrsro or is determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor if there is a default by the counterparty the fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction the swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation as a result the swap market has become relatively liquid caps floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully developed and accordingly they are less liquid than swaps eurodollar instruments the fund may make investments in eurodollar instruments eurodollar instruments are us dollardenominated futures contracts or options thereon which are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor although foreign currencydenominated instruments are available from time to time eurodollar futures contracts enable purchasers to obtain a fixed rate for the lending of funds and sellers to obtain a fixed rate for borrowings the fund might use eurodollar futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in libor to which many interest rate swaps and fixed income instruments are linked risks of strategic transactions outside the us when conducted outside the us strategic transactions may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in the funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity use of segregated and other special accounts many strategic transactions in addition to other requirements require that the fund segregate cash or liquid assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by the fund to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid securities at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by the fund will require the fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid securities sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by the fund on an index will require the fund to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by the fund requires the fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price except when the fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency which requires no segregation a currency contract which obligates the fund to buy or sell currency will generally require the fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid securities denominated in that currency equal to the funds obligations or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the amount of the funds obligation otc options entered into by the fund including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when the fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by the fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when the fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price the fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by the fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and the fund will segregate an amount of assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon the fund must deposit initial margin and possibly daily variation margin in addition to segregating assets sufficient to meet its obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such assets may consist of cash cash equivalents shortterm debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps the fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of its obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars require segregation of assets with a value equal to the funds net obligation if any strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies the fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and strategic transactions for example the fund could purchase a put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by the fund moreover instead of segregating assets if

that becomes substantially worthless under the code gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates which occur between the time the fund accrues receivables or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time the fund actually collects such receivables or pays such liabilities generally are treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss similarly on disposition of debt

of the fund other than the taxable year of the excess distribution or disposition would be taxed to the fund at the highest ordinary income rate in effect for such year and the tax would be further increased by an interest charge to reflect the value of the tax deferral deemed to have resulted from the ownership of the foreign companys stock any amount of distribution or gain allocated to the

these shares any marktomarket losses and any loss from an actual disposition of shares would be reported as ordinary loss to the extent of any net marktomarket gains included in income in prior years the effect of the election would be to treat excess distributions and gain on dispositions as ordinary income which is not subject to a fund level tax when distributed to shareholders as a dividend

of the shares of each series and all income earnings profits and proceeds thereof subject only to the rights of creditors are specifically allocated to such series and constitute the underlying assets of such series the underlying assets of each series are segregated on the books of account and are to be charged with the liabilities in respect to such series and with such a share of the general

a change in investment policy for a series would be voted upon only by shareholders of the series involved additionally approval of the investment advisory agreement is a matter to be determined separately by each series approval by the shareholders of one series is effective as to that series whether or not enough votes are received from the shareholders of the other series to approve such

corporate bonds sp debt rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by sp capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong debt rated aa has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differs from the highest rated issues only in small degree debt rated a has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories debt rated bbb is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories debt rated bb b ccc cc and c is regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such debt will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions debt rated bb has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments the bb rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bbb rating debt rated b has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to pay interest and repay principal the b rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bb or bb rating debt rated ccc has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions it is not likely to have the capacity to pay interest and repay principal the ccc rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied b or b rating the rating cc typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied ccc rating the rating c typically is applied to debt subordinated to senior debt which is assigned an actual or implied ccc debt rating the c rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed but debt service payments are continued the rating c is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being paid debt rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period had not expired unless sp believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are jeopardized moodys bonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well bonds which are rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal  plast page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class bonds which are rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small bonds which are rated caa are of poor standing such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest bonds which are rated ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings bonds which are rated c are the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing  rdates referenced herein   and   documents incorporated by reference

assets in us and foreign equities equities issued by us and foreignbased companies most of the funds equities are common stocks although the fund can invest in companies of any size and from any country it invests mainly in common stocks of established companies in countries with developed economies the funds equity investments are mainly common stocks but may also include preferred stocks and other securities with equity characteristics such as convertible securities and warrants in choosing securities the portfolio manager uses a combination of three analytical disciplines bottomup research the manager looks for individual companies with a history of aboveaverage growth strong competitive positioning attractive prices relative to potential growth sound financial strength and effective management among other factors growth orientation the manager generally looks for companies that the manager believes have aboveaverage potential for sustainable growth of revenue or earnings and whose market value appears reasonable in light of their business prospects analysis of global themes the manager considers global economic outlooks seeking to identify industries and companies that are likely to benefit from social political and economic changes the manager uses analytical tools to actively monitor the risk profile of the portfolio as compared to comparable funds and appropriate benchmarks and peer groups   dws global thematic fund pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the manager may favor different types of securities from different industries and companies at different times while still maintaining variety in terms of the types of securities issuers and countries represented the manager will normally sell a stock when the manager believes its price is unlikely to go much higher its fundamentals have deteriorated other investments offer better opportunities or in the course of adjusting the funds exposure to a given country other investments the fund is permitted but not required to use various types of derivatives contracts whose value is based on for example indices currencies or securities derivatives may be used for hedging and for risk management or for nonhedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains the fund may use derivatives in circumstances where portfolio management believes they offer an economical means of gaining exposure to a particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions or other needs while maintaining exposure to the market securities lending the fund may lend its investment securities in an amount up to   of its total assets to approved institutional borrowers who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments stock market risk as with most stock funds an important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform  in this case us and foreign stock markets when us and foreign stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well compared to large company stocks small company stocks tend to be more volatile in part because these companies tend to be less established and the valuation of their stocks often depends on future expectations because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies in addition movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stocks the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs this fund is designed for longterm investors who are interested in a broadly diversified approach to global investing with an emphasis on longterm growth of capital dws global thematic fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th price regardless of how well the company performs the market as a whole may not favor the types of investments the fund makes and the fund may not be able to get attractive prices for them security selection risk a risk that pervades all investing is the risk that the securities in the funds portfolio may decline in value foreign investment risk foreign investments involve certain special risks including  political risk some foreign governments have limited the outflow of profits to investors abroad imposed restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency extended diplomatic disputes to include trade and financial relations seized foreign investment and imposed high taxes  information risk companies based in foreign markets are usually not subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as stringent as those in the us therefore their financial reports may present an incomplete untimely or misleading picture of a foreign company as compared to the financial reports of us companies  liquidity risk investments that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell than more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular investment as well as the size and liquidity of the entire local market on the whole foreign exchanges are smaller and less liquid than the us market this can make buying and selling certain investments more difficult and costly relatively small transactions in some instances can have a disproportionately large effect on the price and supply of securities in certain situations it may become virtually impossible to sell an investment in an orderly fashion at a price that approaches portfolio managements estimate of its value for the same reason it may at times be difficult to value the funds foreign investments  regulatory risk there is generally less government regulation of foreign markets companies and securities dealers than in the us   dws global thematic fund pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th  currency risk the fund invests in securities denominated in foreign currencies this creates the possibility that changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the us dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities  limited legal recourse risk legal remedies for investors may be more limited than the remedies available in the us  trading practice risk brokerage commissions and other fees are generally higher for foreign investments than for us investments the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody may also involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments  taxes foreign withholding and certain other taxes may reduce the amount of income available to distribute to shareholders of the fund in addition special us tax considerations may apply to the funds foreign investments emerging market risk all of the risks of investing in foreign securities are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets securities in addition profound social changes and business practices that depart from norms in developed countries economies have hindered the orderly growth of emerging economies and their markets in the past and have caused instability high levels of debt tend to make emerging economies heavily reliant on foreign capital and vulnerable to capital flight these countries are also more likely to experience high levels of inflation deflation or currency devaluation which could also hurt their economies and securities markets for these and other reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative pricing risk at times market conditions might make it hard to value some investments and the fund may use certain valuation methodologies for some of its investments such as fair value pricing given the subjective nature of such methodologies it is possible that the value determined for an investment may be different than the value realized upon such investments sale if the fund has valued its securities too highly you may end up paying too much for fund shares when you buy into the fund if the fund underestimates the price of its securities you may not receive the full market value for your fund shares when you sell dws global thematic fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th securities lending risk any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the fund that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by the fund and would adversely affect the funds performance also there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while the loan is outstanding however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by the funds delegate after a review of relevant facts and circumstances including the creditworthiness of the borrower derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements another factor that could affect performance is  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of industries companies economic trends the relative attractiveness of different securities or other matters   dws global thematic fund pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the funds performance history while a funds past performance before and after taxes isnt

emerging markets securities in addition profound social changes and business practices that depart from norms in developed countries economies have hindered the orderly growth of emerging economies and their markets in the past and have caused instability high levels of debt tend to make emerging economies heavily reliant on foreign capital and vulnerable to capital flight these countries are also more likely to experience high levels of inflation deflation or currency devaluation which could also hurt their economies and securities markets for these and other reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative pricing risk at times market conditions might make it hard to value some investments and the fund may use certain valuation methodologies for some of its investments such as fair value pricing given the subjective nature of such methodologies it is possible that the value determined for an investment may be different than the value realized upon such investments sale if the fund has valued its securities too highly you may end up paying too much for fund shares when you buy into the fund if the fund underestimates the price of its securities you may not receive the full market value for your fund shares when you sell securities lending risk any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the fund that occurs during the term of the

the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the

such as those that trade in foreign markets are illiquid or do not otherwise have readily available market quotations certain investors may seek to employ shortterm trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by a fund eg time zone arbitrage each fund discourages shortterm and excessive trading and has adopted policies and procedures that are intended to detect and deter shortterm and excessive trading pursuant to its policies each fund will impose a  redemption fee on fund shares held for less than a

shareholder or deems any other trading activity harmful or disruptive to a fund each fund through its advisor and transfer agent will measure shortterm and excessive trading by the number of roundtrip transactions within a shareholders account during a rolling month period a roundtrip transaction is defined as any combination of purchase and redemption activity including exchanges of the same funds shares each fund may take other trading activity into account if a fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be harmful to longterm shareholders or disruptive to portfolio management shareholders are limited to four roundtrip transactions in the same dws fund excluding money market funds over a rolling month period shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions

redemption fee policy see redemption fees described below the advisor may make exceptions to the roundtrip transaction policy for certain types of transactions if in its opinion the transactions do not represent shortterm or excessive trading or are not abusive or harmful to a fund such as but not limited to systematic transactions required minimum retirement distributions transactions initiated by a fund or administrator and transactions by certain qualified fundoffunds in certain circumstances where shareholders hold shares of a fund through a financial intermediary the fund may rely upon

are not in the best interests of a fund a financial intermediarys policy relating to shortterm or excessive trading policies you should know about   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th may be more or less restrictive than the dws funds policy may permit certain transactions not permitted by the dws funds policies or prohibit transactions not subject to the dws funds policies the advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial intermediary to enforce shortterm or excessive trading policies on behalf of a fund that provide a substantially similar level of protection for each fund against such transactions for example certain financial intermediaries may have contractual legal or operational restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if a fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign securities it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect the fund from time zone arbitrage with respect to its foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by a fund see how each fund calculates share price there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in limiting shortterm and excessive trading in all cases for example the advisor may not be able to effectively monitor detect or limit shortterm or excessive trading by underlying shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries the advisor reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor has reason to suspect that shortterm or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level the advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request underlying shareholder level activity depending on the amount of fund shares held in such omnibus accounts which may represent most of a funds shares shortterm andor excessive trading of fund shares could adversely affect longterm shareholders in a fund if shortterm or excessive trading is identified the advisor will take appropriate action each funds market timing policies and procedures may be modified or terminated at any time redemption fees each fund imposes a redemption fee of  of the total redemption amount calculated at net asset value without regard to the effect of any contingent deferred sales charge any contingent deferred sales charge is also assessed   policies you should know about pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st on the total redemption amount without regard to the assessment of the  redemption fee on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within  days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to each fund and is designed to encourage longterm investment and to offset transaction and other costs associated with shortterm or excessive trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with a fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not known to a fund for this reason each fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to collect and remit the proceeds to each fund however due to operational requirements the intermediaries methods for tracking and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects from each funds subject to approval by the advisor or each funds board intermediaries who transact business on an omnibus basis may implement the redemption fees according to their own operational guidelines which may be different than the funds policies and remit the fees to the funds the redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the following exchange or redemption transactions i transactions on behalf of participants in certain research wrap programs ii transactions on behalf of participants in certain group retirement plans and

companies and listed on foreign exchanges although the fund can invest in companies of any size and from any country it invests mainly in common stocks of established companies in countries with developed economies other than the united states the fund may invest up to  of net assets in foreign debt securities including convertible bonds the funds equity investments are mainly common stocks but may also include preferred stocks and other securities with equity characteristics such as convertible securities and warrants in choosing securities the portfolio manager uses a combination of two analytical disciplines bottomup research the manager look for individual companies with a history of above average growth strong competitive positioning attractive prices relative to potential growth sound financial strength and effective management among other factors topdown analysis the manager considers the economic outlooks for various sectors and industries while looking for those that may benefit from changes in the overall business environment the manager may favor different types of securities from different industries and companies at different times while still maintaining variety in terms of the types of securities issuers and countries represented the manager will normally sell a stock when the manager believes its price is unlikely to go much higher its fundamentals have deteriorated other investments offer better opportunities or in the course of adjusting the funds exposure to a given country   dws international fund pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd other investments the fund is permitted but not required to use various types of derivatives contracts whose value is based on for example indices currencies or securities derivatives may be used for hedging and for risk management or for nonhedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains the fund may use derivatives in circumstances where portfolio management believes they offer an economical means of gaining exposure to a particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions or other needs while maintaining exposure to the market securities lending the fund may lend its investment securities in an amount up to   of its total assets to approved institutional borrowers who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments stock market risk as with most stock funds an important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform  to the extent the fund invests in a particular geographic region the funds performance may be proportionately affected by that regions general performance when stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies in addition movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stocks price regardless of how well the company performs the market as a whole may not favor the types of investments the fund makes and the fund may not be able to get attractive prices for them security selection risk a risk that pervades all investing is the risk that the securities in the funds portfolio may decline in value foreign investment risk foreign investments involve certain special risks including the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs the fund is designed for investors who are interested in a broadly diversified nonus international investment with the emphasis squarely on longterm growth of capital dws international fund   prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd  political risk some foreign governments have limited the outflow of profits to investors abroad imposed restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency extended diplomatic disputes to include trade and financial relations seized foreign investment and imposed high taxes  information risk companies based in foreign markets are usually not subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as stringent as those in the us therefore their financial reports may present an incomplete untimely or misleading picture of a foreign company as compared to the financial reports of us companies  liquidity risk investments that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell than more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular investment as well as the size and liquidity of the entire local market on the whole foreign exchanges are smaller and less liquid than the us market this can make buying and selling certain investments more difficult and costly relatively small transactions in some instances can have a disproportionately large effect on the price and supply of securities in certain situations it may become virtually impossible to sell an investment in an orderly fashion at a price that approaches portfolio managements estimate of its value for the same reason it may at times be difficult to value the funds foreign investments  regulatory risk there is generally less government regulation of foreign markets companies and securities dealers than in the us  currency risk the fund invests in securities denominated in foreign currencies this creates the possibility that changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the us dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities  limited legal recourse risk legal remedies for investors may be more limited than the remedies available in the us   dws international fund pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th  trading practice risk brokerage commissions and other fees are generally higher for foreign investments than for us investments the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody may also involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments  taxes foreign withholding and certain other taxes may reduce the amount of income available to distribute to shareholders of the fund in addition special us tax considerations may apply to the funds foreign investments emerging market risk all of the risks of investing in foreign securities are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets securities in addition profound social changes and business practices that depart from norms in developed countries economies have hindered the orderly growth of emerging economies and their markets in the past and have caused instability high levels of debt tend to make emerging economies heavily reliant on foreign capital and vulnerable to capital flight these countries are also more likely to experience high levels of inflation deflation or currency devaluation which could also hurt their economies and securities markets for these and other reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative pricing risk at times market conditions might make it hard to value some investments and the fund may use certain valuation methodologies for some of its investments such as fair value pricing given the subjective nature of such methodologies it is possible that the value determined for an investment may be different than the value realized upon such investments sale if the fund has valued its securities too highly you may end up paying too much for fund shares when you buy into the fund if the fund underestimates the price of its securities you may not receive the full market value for your fund shares when you sell securities lending risk any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the fund that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by the fund and would adversely affect the funds performance also there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially dws international fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th while the loan is outstanding however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by the funds delegate after a review of relevant facts and circumstances including the creditworthiness of the borrower derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements another factor that could affect performance is  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of industries companies economic trends the relative attractiveness of different securities or other matters   dws international fund

shareholders including potential dilution in the value of fund shares interference with the efficient management of the funds portfolio including losses on the sale of investments taxable gains to remaining shareholders and increased brokerage and administrative costs these risks may be more pronounced if the fund invests in certain securities such as those that trade in foreign markets are illiquid or do not otherwise have readily available market quotations certain investors may seek to employ shortterm trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by the fund eg time zone arbitrage the fund discourages shortterm and excessive trading and has adopted policies and procedures that are intended to detect and deter shortterm and excessive trading pursuant to its policies the fund will impose a  redemption fee on fund shares held for less than a specified holding period subject to certain exceptions discussed below under redemption fees the fund also reserves the right to reject or cancel a purchase or exchange order for any reason without prior notice for example the fund may in its discretion reject or cancel a purchase or an exchange order even if the transaction is not subject to the specific roundtrip transaction limitation described below if the advisor believes that there appears to be a pattern of shortterm or excessive trading activity by a shareholder or deems any other trading activity harmful or disruptive to the fund the fund through its advisor and transfer agent will measure shortterm and excessive trading by the number of roundtrip transactions within a shareholders account during a rolling month period a roundtrip transaction is   policies you should know about pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th defined as any combination of purchase and redemption activity including exchanges of the same funds shares the fund may take other trading activity into

transactions in the same dws fund excluding money market funds over a rolling month period shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions in the same dws fund within a rolling month period generally will be blocked from making additional purchases of or exchanges into that dws fund the fund has sole discretion whether to remove a block from a shareholders account the rights of a shareholder to redeem shares of a dws fund are not affected by the four roundtrip transaction limitation but all redemptions remain subject to the funds redemption fee policy see redemption fees described below the advisor may make exceptions to the roundtrip transaction policy for certain types of transactions if in its opinion the transactions do not represent shortterm or excessive trading or are not abusive or harmful to the fund such as but not limited to systematic transactions required minimum retirement distributions transactions initiated by the fund or administrator and transactions by certain qualified fundoffunds in certain circumstances where shareholders hold shares of the fund through a financial intermediary the fund may rely upon the financial intermediarys policy to deter shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor believes that the financial intermediarys policy is reasonably designed to detect and deter transactions that are not in the best interests of the fund a financial intermediarys policy relating to shortterm or excessive trading may be more or less restrictive than the dws funds policy may permit certain transactions not permitted by the dws funds policies or prohibit transactions not subject to the dws funds policies the advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial intermediary to enforce shortterm or excessive trading policies on behalf of the fund that provide a substantially similar level of protection for the fund against such transactions for example certain financial intermediaries may have contractual legal or policies you should know about   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th operational restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if the fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign securities it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect the fund from time zone arbitrage with respect to its foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by the fund see how the fund calculates share price there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in limiting shortterm and excessive trading in all cases for example the advisor may not be able to effectively monitor detect or limit shortterm or excessive trading by underlying shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries the advisor reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor has reason to suspect that shortterm or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level the advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request underlying shareholder level activity depending on the amount of fund shares held in such omnibus accounts which may represent most of the funds shares shortterm andor excessive trading of fund shares could adversely affect longterm shareholders in the fund if shortterm or excessive trading is identified the advisor will take appropriate action the funds market timing policies and procedures may be modified or terminated at any time redemption fees the fund imposes a redemption fee of  of the total redemption amount calculated at net asset value on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within  days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to the fund and is designed to encourage longterm investment and to offset transaction and other costs associated with shortterm or excessive trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last   policies you should know about pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with the fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not known to the fund for this reason the fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to collect and remit the proceeds to the fund however due to operational requirements the intermediaries methods for tracking and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects from the funds the redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the following exchange or redemption transactions i transactions on behalf of

factors growth orientation the manager generally looks for companies that the manager believes have aboveaverage potential for sustainable growth of revenue or earnings and whose market value appears reasonable in light of their business prospects analysis of global themes the manager considers global economic outlooks seeking to identify industries and companies that are likely to benefit from

that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments stock market risk as with most stock funds an important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform  in this case us and foreign stock markets when us and foreign stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well compared to large company stocks small company stocks tend to be more volatile in part because these companies tend to be less established and the valuation of their stocks often depends on future expectations because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies in addition movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stocks the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs this fund is designed for longterm investors who

increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements another factor

available market quotations certain investors may seek to employ shortterm trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by

the number of roundtrip transactions within a shareholders account during a rolling month period a roundtrip transaction is defined as any combination of purchase and redemption activity including exchanges of the same funds shares each fund may take other trading activity into account if a fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be harmful to longterm shareholders or

shortterm or excessive trading may be more or less restrictive than the dws funds policy may permit certain transactions not permitted by the dws funds policies or prohibit transactions not subject to

similar level of protection for each fund against such transactions for example certain financial intermediaries may have contractual legal or operational restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if a fund invests some

fund seeks longterm capital appreciation with current income as a secondary objective under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its assets determined at the time of purchase in the stocks and other securities with equity characteristics of companies in developed countries outside the united states almost all the companies in which the fund invests are based in the developed foreign countries that make up the morgan stanley capital international europe australasia and far east index msci eafe reg tm index the fund may also invest a portion of its assets in companies based in the emerging markets of latin america the middle east europe asia and africa if the portfolio managers believe that their return potential more than compensates for the extra risks associated with these markets while the portfolio managers have invested in emerging markets in the past under normal market conditions they do not consider this a central element of the funds strategy typically the fund would not hold more than  of its net assets in emerging markets in implementing this overall strategy the fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate the funds equity investments are mainly common stocks but may also include other types of equities such as preferred stocks or convertible securities the fund may also invest up to  of its assets in cash equivalents us investmentgrade fixedincome securities and us stocks and other equities the fund invests for the long term the portfolio managers employ a value strategy and invest in companies that they believe are undervalued these are typically companies that have been historically sound but are temporarily out of favor the fund intends to invest primarily in companies whose market capitalizations fall within the normal range of the msci eafe reg tm index   dws international value opportunities fund pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the portfolio managers track several thousand companies to arrive at between  to  stocks the fund normally holds the managers use a variety of quantitative screens to compare a companys stock price to its book value cash flow and dividend yield and analyze individual companies to identify those that are financially sound and appear to have strong potential for longterm growth after narrowing the investment universe through the use of valuation screens the portfolio managers use of fundamental research tools lies at the heart of the investment process the portfolio managers process brings an added dimension to this fundamental research by drawing on the insight of experts from a range of financial disciplines  regional stock market specialists global industry specialists economists and quantitative analysts they challenge refine and amplify each others ideas their close collaboration is a critical element of the portfolio managers investment process other investments the fund is permitted but not required to use various types of derivatives contracts whose value is based on for example indices currencies or securities derivatives may be used for hedging and for risk management or for nonhedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains the fund may use derivatives in circumstances where portfolio management believes they offer an economical means of gaining exposure to a particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions or other needs while maintaining exposure to the market securities lending the fund may lend its investment securities in an amount up to   of its total assets to approved institutional borrowers who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments stock market risk as with most stock funds an important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform  to the extent the fund invests in a particular geographic region the funds performance may be proportionately affected by that regions general performance when stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well dws international value opportunities fund   pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies in addition movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stocks price regardless of how well the company performs the market as a whole may not favor the types of investments the fund makes and the fund may not be able to get attractive prices for them security selection risk a risk that pervades all investing is the risk that the securities in the funds portfolio may decline in value foreign investment risk foreign investments involve certain special risks including  political risk some foreign governments have limited the outflow of profits to investors abroad imposed restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency extended diplomatic disputes to include trade and financial relations seized foreign investment and imposed high taxes  information risk companies based in foreign markets are usually not subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as stringent as those in the us therefore their financial reports may present an incomplete untimely or misleading picture of a foreign company as compared to the financial reports of us companies  liquidity risk investments that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell than more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular investment as well as the size and liquidity of the entire local market on the whole foreign exchanges are smaller and less liquid than the us market this can make buying and selling certain investments more difficult and costly relatively small transactions in some instances can have a disproportionately large effect on the price and supply of securities in certain situations it may become virtually impossible to sell an investment in an orderly fashion at a price that approaches portfolio managements estimate of its value for the same reason it may at times be difficult to value the funds foreign investments the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs the fund is designed for investors who are seeking capital appreciation and are willing to accept the risks of investing in the stocks of foreign companies   dws international value opportunities fund pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd  regulatory risk there is generally less government regulation of foreign markets companies and securities dealers than in the us  currency risk the fund invests in securities denominated in foreign currencies this creates the possibility that changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the us dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities  limited legal recourse risk legal remedies for investors may be more limited than the remedies available in the us  trading practice risk brokerage commissions and other fees are generally higher for foreign investments than for us investments the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody may also involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments  taxes foreign withholding and certain other taxes may reduce the amount of income available to distribute to shareholders of the fund in addition special us tax considerations may apply to the funds foreign investments emerging market risk all of the risks of investing in foreign securities are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets securities in addition profound social changes and business practices that depart from norms in developed countries economies have hindered the orderly growth of emerging economies and their markets in the past and have caused instability high levels of debt tend to make emerging economies heavily reliant on foreign capital and vulnerable to capital flight these countries are also more likely to experience high levels of inflation deflation or currency devaluation which could also hurt their economies and securities markets for these and other reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could dws international value opportunities fund   prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements pricing risk at times market conditions might make it hard to value some investments and the fund may use certain valuation methodologies for some of its investments such as fair value pricing given the subjective nature of such methodologies it is possible that the value determined for an investment may be different than the value realized upon such investments sale if the fund has valued its securities too highly you may end up paying too much for fund shares when you buy into the fund if the fund underestimates the price of its securities you may not receive the full market value for your fund shares when you sell securities lending risk any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the fund that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by the fund and would adversely affect the funds performance also there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while the loan is outstanding however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by the funds delegate after a

such as those that trade in foreign markets are illiquid or do not otherwise have readily available market quotations certain investors may seek to employ shortterm trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by the fund eg time zone arbitrage the fund discourages shortterm and excessive trading and has adopted

fund will impose a  redemption fee on fund shares held for less than a specified holding period subject to certain exceptions discussed below under redemption fees the fund also reserves the right to reject or cancel a purchase or exchange order for any reason without prior notice for example the fund may in its discretion reject or cancel a purchase or an exchange order even if the transaction is not subject to the specific roundtrip transaction limitation described below if the advisor believes that there appears to be a pattern of shortterm or excessive trading activity by a shareholder or deems any other trading activity harmful or disruptive to the fund the fund through its advisor and transfer agent will measure shortterm and excessive trading by the number of roundtrip transactions within a shareholders account during a rolling month period a roundtrip transaction is defined as any combination of purchase and redemption activity including exchanges of the same funds shares the fund may take other trading activity into account if the fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be harmful to longterm shareholders or disruptive to portfolio management shareholders are limited to four roundtrip transactions in the same dws fund excluding money market funds over a rolling month period shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions in the same dws fund within a rolling month period generally will be blocked from making additional purchases of or exchanges into that dws fund the fund has sole discretion whether to remove a block from a shareholders account the rights of a shareholder to redeem shares of a dws fund are not affected by the four roundtrip transaction limitation but all redemptions remain subject to the funds redemption fee policy see redemption fees described below the advisor may make exceptions to the roundtrip transaction policy for certain types of transactions if in its opinion the transactions do not represent shortterm or excessive trading or are not abusive or harmful to the fund such as but not limited to systematic transactions required minimum retirement distributions transactions initiated by the fund

of the fund through a financial intermediary the fund may rely upon the financial intermediarys policy to deter shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor believes that the financial intermediarys policy is reasonably designed to detect and deter transactions that are not in the best interests of the fund a financial intermediarys policy relating to shortterm or excessive trading may be more or less restrictive than the dws funds policy may permit certain transactions not permitted by the dws funds policies or prohibit transactions not subject to the dws funds policies the advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial intermediary to enforce shortterm or excessive trading policies on behalf of the fund that provide a substantially similar level of protection for the fund against such transactions for example certain financial intermediaries may have contractual legal or operational restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if the fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign securities it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect the fund from time zone arbitrage with respect to its foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by the fund see how the fund calculates share price there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in limiting shortterm and excessive trading in all cases for example the advisor may not be able to effectively monitor detect or limit shortterm or excessive trading by underlying shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries the advisor reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor has reason to suspect that shortterm or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level the advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request underlying shareholder level activity depending on the amount of fund shares held in such omnibus accounts which may represent most of the funds shares shortterm andor excessive trading of fund shares could adversely affect longterm shareholders in the fund if shortterm or excessive trading is identified the advisor will take appropriate action   policies you should know about

amount without regard to the assessment of the  redemption fee on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within  days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to the fund and is designed to encourage longterm investment and to offset transaction and other costs associated with shortterm or excessive trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with the fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not known to the fund for this reason the fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to collect and remit the proceeds to the fund however due to operational requirements the intermediaries methods for tracking and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects from the funds subject to approval by the advisor or the funds board intermediaries who transact business on an omnibus basis may implement the redemption fees according to their own operational guidelines which may be different than the funds policies and remit the fees to the fund the redemption fee will

investment strategy the fund seeks longterm capital appreciation with current income as a secondary objective under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its assets determined at the time of purchase in the stocks and other securities with equity characteristics of companies in developed countries outside the united states almost all the companies in which the fund invests are based in the developed foreign countries that make up the morgan stanley capital international europe australasia and far east index msci eafe reg tm index the fund may also invest a portion of its assets in companies based in the emerging markets of latin america the middle east europe asia and africa if the portfolio managers believe that their return potential more than compensates for the extra risks associated with these markets while the portfolio managers have invested in emerging markets in the past under normal market conditions they do not consider this a central element of the funds strategy typically the fund would not hold more than  of its net assets in emerging markets in implementing this overall strategy the fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate the funds equity investments are mainly common stocks but may also include other types of equities such as preferred stocks or convertible securities the fund may also invest up to  of its assets in cash equivalents us investmentgrade fixedincome securities and us stocks and other equities the fund invests for the long term the portfolio managers employ a value strategy and invest in companies that they believe are undervalued these are typically companies that have been historically sound but are temporarily out of favor the fund intends to invest primarily in companies whose market capitalizations fall within the normal range of the msci eafe reg tm index   dws international value opportunities fund pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the portfolio managers track several thousand companies to arrive at between  to  stocks the fund normally holds the managers use a variety of quantitative screens to compare a companys stock price to its book value cash flow and dividend yield and analyze individual companies to identify those that are financially sound and appear to have strong potential for longterm growth after narrowing the investment universe through the use of valuation screens the portfolio managers use of fundamental research tools lies at the heart of the investment process the portfolio managers process brings an added dimension to this fundamental research by drawing on the insight of experts from a range of financial disciplines  regional stock market specialists global industry specialists economists and quantitative analysts they challenge refine and amplify each others ideas their close collaboration is a critical element of the portfolio managers investment process other investments the fund is permitted but not required to use various types of derivatives contracts whose value is based on for example indices currencies or securities derivatives may be used for hedging and for risk management or for nonhedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains the fund may use derivatives in circumstances where portfolio management believes they offer an economical means of gaining exposure to a particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions or other needs while maintaining exposure to the market securities lending the fund may lend its investment securities in an amount up to   of its total assets to approved institutional borrowers who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments stock market risk as with most stock funds an important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform  to the extent the fund invests in a particular geographic region the funds performance may be proportionately affected by that regions general performance when stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well dws international value opportunities fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies in addition movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stocks price regardless of how well the company performs the market as a whole may not favor the types of investments the fund makes and the fund may not be able to get attractive prices for them security selection risk a risk that pervades all investing is the risk that the securities in the funds portfolio may decline in value foreign investment risk foreign investments involve certain special risks including  political risk some foreign governments have limited the outflow of profits to investors abroad imposed restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency extended diplomatic disputes to include trade and financial relations seized foreign investment and imposed high taxes  information risk companies based in foreign markets are usually not subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as stringent as those in the us therefore their financial reports may present an incomplete untimely or misleading picture of a foreign company as compared to the financial reports of us companies  liquidity risk investments that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell than more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular investment as well as the size and liquidity of the entire local market on the whole foreign exchanges are smaller and less liquid than the us market this can make buying and selling certain investments more difficult and costly relatively small transactions in some instances can have a disproportionately large effect on the price and supply of securities in certain situations it may become virtually impossible to sell an investment in an orderly fashion at a price that approaches portfolio managements estimate of its value for the same reason it may at times be difficult to value the funds foreign investments the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs the fund is designed for investors who are seeking capital appreciation and are willing to accept the risks of investing in the stocks of foreign companies   dws international value opportunities fund pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th  regulatory risk there is generally less government regulation of foreign markets companies and securities dealers than in the us  currency risk the fund invests in securities denominated in foreign currencies this creates the possibility that changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the us dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities  limited legal recourse risk legal remedies for investors may be more limited than the remedies available in the us  trading practice risk brokerage commissions and other fees are generally higher for foreign investments than for us investments the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody may also involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments  taxes foreign withholding and certain other taxes may reduce the amount of income available to distribute to shareholders of the fund in addition special us tax considerations may apply to the funds foreign investments emerging market risk all of the risks of investing in foreign securities are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets securities in addition profound social changes and business practices that depart from norms in developed countries economies have hindered the orderly growth of emerging economies and their markets in the past and have caused instability high levels of debt tend to make emerging economies heavily reliant on foreign capital and vulnerable to capital flight these countries are also more likely to experience high levels of inflation deflation or currency devaluation which could also hurt their economies and securities markets for these and other reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could dws international value opportunities fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements pricing risk at times market conditions might make it hard to value some investments and the fund may use certain valuation methodologies for some of its investments such as fair value pricing given the subjective nature of such methodologies it is possible that the value determined for an investment may be different than the value realized upon such investments sale if the fund has valued its securities too highly you may end up paying too much for fund shares when you buy into the fund if the fund underestimates the price of its securities you may not receive the full market value for your fund shares when you sell securities lending risk any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the fund that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by the fund and would adversely affect the funds performance also there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while the loan is outstanding however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by the funds delegate after a

the main points of the funds strategy and risks there are a few other issues to know about  although major changes tend to be infrequent the funds board could change the funds investment objective without seeking shareholder approval however the board will provide shareholders with at least  days notice prior to making any changes to the funds  investment policy as described herein  as a temporary defensive measure the fund could shift up to  of assets into investments such as money market securities or other shortterm securities that offer comparable levels of risk this could prevent losses but while engaged in a temporary defensive position the fund will not be pursuing its investment goal however portfolio management may choose not to use these strategies for various reasons even in volatile market conditions  the fund may trade actively this could raise transaction costs thus lowering return and could mean higher taxable distributions secondary risks credit risk a fund

brokerage and administrative costs these risks may be more pronounced if the fund invests in certain securities such as those that trade in foreign markets are illiquid or do not otherwise have

the fund also reserves the right to reject or cancel a purchase or exchange order for any reason without prior notice for example the fund may in its discretion reject or cancel a purchase or an

through its advisor and transfer agent will measure shortterm and excessive trading by the number of roundtrip transactions within a shareholders account during a rolling month period a roundtrip transaction is defined as any combination of purchase and redemption activity including exchanges of the same funds shares the fund may take other trading activity into account if the fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be harmful to longterm shareholders or disruptive to portfolio management shareholders are limited to four roundtrip transactions in the same dws fund excluding money market funds over a rolling month period shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions in the same dws fund within a rolling month period generally will be blocked from making additional purchases of or exchanges into that dws fund the fund has sole discretion whether to remove a block from a shareholders account the rights of a shareholder to redeem shares of a dws fund are not affected by the four roundtrip transaction limitation but all redemptions remain subject to the funds redemption fee policy see redemption fees described below the advisor may make exceptions to the roundtrip transaction policy for certain types of transactions if in its opinion the transactions do not represent shortterm or excessive trading or are not abusive or harmful to the fund such as but not limited to systematic transactions required minimum retirement distributions transactions initiated by the fund or administrator and transactions by certain qualified fundoffunds in certain circumstances where shareholders hold shares of the fund through a financial intermediary the fund may rely upon the financial intermediarys policy to deter shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor believes that the financial intermediarys policy is reasonably designed to detect and deter transactions that are not in the best interests of the fund a financial intermediarys policy relating to shortterm or excessive trading may be more or less restrictive than the dws funds policy may permit certain transactions not permitted by the dws funds policies or prohibit transactions not subject to the dws funds policies   policies you should know about pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial intermediary to enforce shortterm or excessive trading policies on behalf of the fund that provide a substantially similar level of protection for the fund against such transactions for example certain financial intermediaries may have contractual legal or operational restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if the fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign securities it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect the fund from time zone arbitrage with respect to its foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by the fund see how the fund calculates share price there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in limiting shortterm and excessive trading in all cases for example the advisor may not be able to effectively monitor detect or limit shortterm or excessive trading by underlying shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries the advisor reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor has reason to suspect that shortterm or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level the advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request underlying shareholder level activity depending on the amount of fund shares held in such omnibus accounts which may represent most of the funds shares shortterm andor excessive trading of fund shares could adversely affect longterm shareholders in the fund if shortterm or excessive trading is identified the advisor will take appropriate action the funds market timing policies and procedures may be modified or terminated at any time redemption fees the fund imposes a redemption fee of  of the total redemption amount calculated at net asset value on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within  days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to the fund and is designed to encourage longterm investment and to offset transaction and other costs policies you should know about   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th associated with shortterm or excessive trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with the fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not known to the fund for this reason the fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to collect and remit the proceeds to the fund however due to operational requirements the intermediaries methods for tracking and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects from the funds the redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the following exchange or redemption transactions i transactions on behalf of participants in certain research

independent pricing service or market quotations where appropriate however we may use methods approved by the funds board such as a fair valuation model which are intended to reflect fair value when pricing service information or market quotations are not readily available or when a securitys value or a meaningful portion of the value of the funds portfolio is believed to have been materially affected by a significant event such as a natural disaster an economic event like a bankruptcy filing or a substantial fluctuation in domestic or foreign markets that has occurred between the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded for example a foreign exchange or market and the close of the new york stock exchange in such a case the funds value for a security is likely to be different from the last quoted market price or pricing service information in addition due to the subjective and variable nature of fair value pricing it is possible that the value determined for a particular asset may be materially different from the value realized upon such assets sale it is expected that the greater the percentage of fund assets that is invested in nonus

permitted but not required to use various types of derivatives contracts whose value is based on for example indices currencies or securities derivatives may be used for hedging and for risk

there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments stock market risk as with most stock funds an important factor with this fund is how stock markets perform  to the extent the fund invests in a particular geographic region the funds performance may be proportionately affected by that regions general performance when stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well dws international value opportunities fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th because a stock represents ownership in its issuer stock prices can be hurt by poor management shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies in addition movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stocks price regardless of how well the company performs the market as a whole may not favor the types of investments the fund makes and the fund may not be able to get attractive prices for them security selection risk a risk that pervades all investing is the risk that the securities in the funds portfolio may decline in value foreign investment risk foreign investments involve certain special risks including  political risk some foreign governments have limited the outflow of profits to investors abroad imposed restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency extended diplomatic disputes to include trade and financial relations seized foreign investment and imposed high taxes  information risk companies based in foreign markets are usually not subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as stringent as those in the us therefore their financial reports may present an incomplete untimely or misleading picture of a foreign company as compared to the financial reports of us companies  liquidity risk investments that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell than more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular investment as well as the size and liquidity of the entire local market on the whole foreign exchanges are smaller and less liquid than the us market this can make buying and selling certain investments more difficult and costly relatively small transactions in some instances can have a disproportionately large effect on the price and supply of securities in certain situations it may become virtually impossible to sell an investment in an orderly fashion at a price that approaches portfolio managements estimate of its value for the same reason it may at times be difficult to value the funds foreign investments the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs the fund is designed for investors who are seeking capital appreciation and are willing to accept the

regulation of foreign markets companies and securities dealers than in the us  currency risk the fund invests in securities denominated in foreign currencies this creates the possibility that changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the us dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities  limited legal recourse risk legal remedies for investors may be more limited than the remedies available in the us  trading practice risk brokerage commissions and other fees are generally higher for foreign investments than for us investments the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody may also involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments  taxes foreign withholding and certain other taxes may reduce the amount of income available to distribute to shareholders of the fund in addition special us tax considerations may apply to the funds foreign investments emerging market risk all of the risks of investing in foreign securities are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets securities in addition profound social changes and business practices that depart from norms in developed countries economies have hindered the orderly growth of emerging economies and their markets in the past and have caused instability high levels of debt tend to make emerging economies heavily reliant on foreign capital and vulnerable to capital flight these countries are also more likely to experience high levels of inflation deflation or currency devaluation which could also hurt their economies and securities markets for these and other reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could dws international value opportunities fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements pricing risk at times market conditions might make it hard to value some investments and the fund may use certain valuation methodologies for some of its investments such as fair value pricing given the subjective nature of such methodologies it is possible that the value determined for an investment may be different than the value realized upon such investments sale if the fund has valued its securities too highly you may end up paying too much for fund shares when you buy into the fund if the fund underestimates the price of its securities you may not receive the full market value for your fund shares when you sell securities lending risk any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the fund that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by the fund and would adversely affect the funds performance also there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while the loan is outstanding however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by the funds delegate after a review of relevant facts and circumstances including the creditworthiness of the borrower

excessive trading policies on behalf of the fund that provide a substantially similar level of protection for the fund against such transactions for example certain financial intermediaries may have contractual legal or operational restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if the fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign securities it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect the fund

days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to the fund and is designed to encourage longterm investment and to offset transaction and other costs associated with shortterm or excessive trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with the fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not

directly in a portfolio of securities invests most or all of its investment assets in a separate registered investment company the master fund with substantially the same investment objective and policies as the feeder fund such a structure permits the pooling of assets of two or more feeder funds preserving separate identities or distribution channels at the feeder fund level based on the premise that certain of the expenses of operating an investment portfolio are relatively fixed a larger investment portfolio may eventually achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average net assets an existing investment company is able to convert to a feeder fund by selling all of its investments which involves brokerage and other transaction costs and realization of a taxable gain or

funds applicable prospectus borrowing as a matter of fundamental policy a fund will not borrow money except as permitted under the  act and as interpreted or modified by regulatory authority having jurisdiction from time to time while each fund does not currently intend to borrow for investment leveraging purposes if such a strategy were implemented in the future it would increase the funds volatility and the risk of loss in a declining market borrowing by a fund will involve special risk considerations the funds assets may change in value during the time a borrowing is outstanding thus increasing exposure to capital risk common stocks common stock is issued by companies to raise cash for business purposes and represents a proportionate interest in the issuing companies therefore a fund participates in the success or failure of any  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th company in which it holds stock the market values of common stock can fluctuate significantly reflecting the business performance of the issuing company investor perception and general economic and financial market movements despite the risk of price volatility however common stocks have historically offered a greater potential for longterm gain on investment compared to other classes of financial assets such as bonds or cash equivalents although there can be no assurance that this will be true in the future convertible securities a fund may invest in convertible securities that is bonds notes debentures preferred stocks and other securities which are convertible into common stock investments in convertible securities can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation andor income through interest and dividend payments by virtue of their conversion or exchange features the convertible securities in which a fund may invest are either fixed income or zero coupon debt securities which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying shares of common stock the exchange ratio for any particular convertible security may be adjusted from time to time due to stock splits dividends spinoffs other corporate distributions or scheduled changes in the exchange ratio convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stocks until converted have general characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities although to a lesser extent than with debt securities generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely tends to increase as interest rates decline in addition because of the conversion or exchange feature the market value of convertible securities typically changes as the market value of the underlying common stocks changes and therefore also tends to follow movements in the general market for equity securities a unique feature of convertible securities is that as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the prices of the convertible securities tend to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock although typically not as much as the underlying common stock while no securities investments are without risk investments in convertible securities generally entail less risk than investments in common stock of the same issuer as debt securities convertible securities are investments which provide for a stream of income or in the case of zero coupon securities accretion of income with generally higher yields than common stocks convertible securities generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality because of their conversion or exchange features of course like all debt securities there can be no assurance of income or principal payments because the issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations convertible securities generally are subordinated to other similar but nonconvertible securities of the same issuer although convertible bonds as corporate debt obligations enjoy seniority in right of payment to all equity securities and convertible preferred stock is senior to common stock of the same issuer however because of the subordination feature convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock typically have lower ratings than similar nonconvertible securities convertible securities may be issued as fixed income obligations that pay current income or as zero coupon notes and bonds including liquid yield option notes lyonstm corporate obligations investment in corporate debt obligations involves credit and interest rate risk the value of fixedincome investments will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and bond market conditions tending to rise as interest rates decline and to decline as interest rates rise corporate debt obligations generally offer less current yield than securities of lower quality but lowerquality securities generally have less liquidity greater credit and market risk and as a result more price volatility longer term bonds are however generally more volatile than bonds with shorter maturities depositary receipts a fund may invest in sponsored or unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs international depositary receipts idrs and other types of depositary receipts which together with adrs gdrs and idrs are hereinafter referred to as depositary receipts depositary receipts provide indirect investment in securities of foreign issuers prices of unsponsored depositary receipts may be more volatile than if they were sponsored by the issuer of  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the underlying securities depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which they may be converted in addition the issuers of the stock of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the united states and therefore there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts adrs are depositary receipts which are bought and sold in the united states and are typically issued by a us bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities by a foreign corporation gdrs idrs and other types of depositary receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they may also be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation generally depositary receipts in registered form are designed for use in the united states securities markets and depositary receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities markets outside the united states for purposes of a funds investment policies a funds investments in adrs gdrs and other types of depositary receipts will be deemed to be investments in the underlying securities depositary receipts including those denominated in us dollars will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk however by investing in us dollardenominated adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock a fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period in general there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs however certain depositary receipts may not be listed on an exchange and therefore may be illiquid securities dollar roll transactions dollar roll transactions consist of the sale by a fund to a bank or brokerdealer the counterparty of gnma certificates or other mortgagebacked securities together with a commitment to purchase from the counterparty similar but not identical securities at a future date at the same price the counterparty receives all principal and interest payments including prepayments made on the security while it is the holder a fund receives a fee from the counterparty as consideration for entering into the commitment to purchase dollar rolls may be renewed over a period of several months with a different purchase and repurchase price fixed and a cash settlement made at each renewal without physical delivery of securities moreover the transaction may be preceded by a firm commitment agreement pursuant to which a fund agrees to buy a security on a future date a fund will segregate cash us government securities or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to meet their purchase obligations under the transactions a fund will also maintain asset coverage to the extent required by the  act dollar rolls may be treated for purposes of the  act as borrowings of a fund because they involve the sale of a security coupled with an agreement to repurchase a dollar roll involves costs to a fund for example while a fund receives a fee as consideration for agreeing to repurchase the security a fund forgoes the right to receive all principal and interest payments while the counterparty holds the security these payments to the counterparty may exceed the fee received by a fund thereby effectively charging a fund interest on its borrowing further although a fund can estimate the amount of expected principal prepayment over the term of the dollar roll a variation in the actual amount of prepayment could increase or decrease the cost of a funds borrowing the entry into dollar rolls involves potential risks of loss that are different from those related to the securities underlying the transactions for example if the counterparty becomes insolvent a funds right to purchase from the counterparty might be restricted additionally the value of such securities may change adversely before a fund is able to purchase them similarly a fund may be required to purchase securities in connection with a dollar roll at a higher price than may otherwise be available on the open market since as noted above the counterparty is required to deliver a similar but not identical security to a fund the security that a fund is required to buy under the dollar roll may be worth less than an identical security finally there can be no assurance that a funds use of the cash that it receives from a dollar roll will provide a return that exceeds borrowing costs euro the implementation of the euro may result in uncertainties for european securities and the operation of a fund the euro was introduced on january   by eleven members countries of the european economic and monetary union emu implementation of the euro requires the redenomination of european debt and equity securities over a period of time which may result in various accounting differences andor tax treatments which would not otherwise occur additional questions are raised by the fact that certain other european community members including the united kingdom did not officially implement the euro on january    pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st eurodollar instruments a fund may make investments in eurodollar instruments for hedging purposes or to enhance potential gain eurodollar instruments are us dollardenominated futures contracts or options thereon which are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor although foreign currencydenominated instruments are available from time to time eurodollar futures contracts enable purchasers to obtain a fixed rate for the lending of funds and sellers to obtain a fixed rate for borrowings a fund might use eurodollar futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in libor to which many interest rate swaps and fixed income instruments are linked or for any other purpose eurodollar obligations eurodollar bank obligations are us dollardenominated certificates of deposit and time deposits issued outside the us capital markets by foreign branches of us banks and us branches of foreign banks eurodollar obligations are subject to the same risks that pertain to domestic issues notably credit risk market risk and liquidity risk additionally eurodollar obligations are subject to certain sovereign risks foreign currencies because investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries and because a fund may hold foreign currencies and forward contracts futures contracts options on foreign currencies and foreign currency futures contracts and other currency related instruments the value of the assets of a fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and a fund may incur costs and experience conversion difficulties and uncertainties in connection with conversions between various currencies fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the earning power and asset value of the foreign entity issuing the security the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies is responsible for part of a funds investment performance if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen for example the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall many foreign currencies have experienced significant devaluation relative to the dollar although a fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to a fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should a fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer a fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into options or forward or futures contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies foreign fixed income securities since most foreign fixed income securities are not rated a fund will invest in foreign fixed income securities based on the advisors analysis without relying on published ratings since such investments will be based upon the advisors analysis rather than upon published ratings achievement of a funds goals may depend more upon the abilities of the advisor than would otherwise be the case the value of the foreign fixed income securities held by a fund and thus the net asset value of a funds shares generally will fluctuate with a changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the issuers of those securities b movements in interest rates and c changes in the relative values of the currencies in which a funds investments in fixed income securities are denominated with respect to the us dollar the extent of the fluctuation will depend on various factors such as the average maturity of a funds investments in foreign fixed income securities and the extent to which a fund hedges its interest rate credit and currency exchange rate risks a longer average maturity generally is associated with a higher level of volatility in the market value of such securities in response to changes in market conditions investments in sovereign debt including brady bonds brady bonds are debt securities issued under a plan implemented to allow debtor nations to restructure their outstanding commercial bank indebtedness involve special risks foreign governmental issuers of debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or pay interest when due in the event of default there may be limited or no legal recourse in that generally remedies for defaults must be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd political conditions especially a sovereign entitys willingness to meet the terms of its fixed income securities are of considerable significance also there can be no assurance that the holders of commercial bank loans to the same sovereign entity may not contest payments to the holders of sovereign debt in the event of default under commercial bank loan agreements in addition there is no bankruptcy proceeding with respect to sovereign debt on which a sovereign has defaulted and a fund may be unable to collect all or any part of its investment in a particular issue foreign investment in certain sovereign debt is restricted or controlled to varying degrees including requiring governmental approval for the repatriation of income capital or proceed of sales by foreign investors these restrictions or controls may at times limit or preclude foreign investment in certain sovereign debt or increase the costs and expenses of a fund sovereign debt of emerging market governmental issuers is to be considered speculative emerging market governmental issuers are among the largest debtors to commercial banks foreign governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions certain emerging market governmental issuers have not been able to make payments of interest on or principal of debt obligations as those payments have come due there is a history of defaults with respect to commercial bank loans by public and private entities issuing sovereign debt all or a portion of the interest payments andor principal repayment with respect to sovereign debt may be uncollateralized obligations arising from past restructuring agreements may affect the economic performance and political and social stability of those issuers the ability of emerging market country governmental issuers to make timely payments on their obligations is likely to be influenced strongly by the issuers balance of payments including export performance and its access to international credits and investments an emerging market whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities could be vulnerable to a decline in the international prices of one or more of those commodities increased protectionism on the part of an emerging markets trading partners could also adversely affect the countrys exports and diminish its trade account surplus if any to the extent that emerging markets receive payment for its exports in currencies other than dollars or nonemerging market currencies its ability to make debt payments denominated in dollars or nonemerging market currencies could be affected another factor bearing on the ability of emerging market countries to repay debt obligations is the level of international reserves of the country fluctuations in the level of these reserves affect the amount of foreign exchange readily available for external debt payments and thus could have a bearing on the capacity of emerging market countries to make payments on these debt obligations to the extent that an emerging market country cannot generate a trade surplus it must depend on continuing loans from foreign governments multilateral organizations or private commercial banks aid payments from foreign governments and inflows of foreign investment the access of emerging markets to these forms of external funding may not be certain and a withdrawal of external funding could adversely affect the capacity of emerging market country governmental issuers to make payments on their obligations in addition the cost of servicing emerging market debt obligations can be affected by a change in international interest rates since the majority of these obligations carry interest rates that are adjusted periodically based upon international rates foreign investments foreign securities are normally denominated and traded in foreign currencies as a result the value of the funds foreign investments and the value of its shares may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar there may be less information publicly available about a foreign issuer than about a us issuer and foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the us the securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers foreign brokerage commissions and other fees are also generally higher than in the us foreign settlement procedures and trade regulations may involve certain risks such as delay in payment or delivery of securities or in the recovery of the funds assets held abroad and expenses not present in the settlement of investments in us markets payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition foreign securities may be subject to the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets imposition of currency exchange controls or restrictions on the repatriation of foreign currency confiscatory taxation political or financial instability and diplomatic developments which could affect the value of the funds investments in certain  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd foreign countries governments of many countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector through the ownership or control of many companies including some of the largest in these countries as a result government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions which may adversely affect prices of certain portfolio securities there is also generally less government supervision and regulation of stock exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the us dividends or interest on or proceeds from the sale of foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes and special us tax considerations may apply moreover foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position legal remedies available to investors in certain foreign countries may be more limited than those available with respect to investments in the us or in other foreign countries the laws of some foreign countries may limit the funds ability to invest in securities of certain issuers organized under the laws of those foreign countries of particular importance many foreign countries are heavily dependent upon exports particularly to developed countries and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the us and other countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by economic conditions in the us and other trading partners which can lower the demand for goods produced in those countries the risks described above including the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets typically are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets for example political and economic structures in these countries may be in their infancy and developing rapidly and such countries may lack the social political and economic stability characteristic of more developed countries including amplified risk of war and terrorism certain of these countries have in the past failed to recognize private property rights and have at times nationalized and expropriated the assets of private companies investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative the currencies of certain emerging market countries have experienced devaluations relative to the us dollar and future devaluations may adversely affect the value of assets denominated in such currencies in addition currency hedging techniques may be unavailable in certain emerging market countries many emerging market countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation or deflation for many years and future inflation may adversely affect the economies and securities markets of such countries in addition unanticipated political or social developments may affect the value of investments in emerging markets and the availability of additional investments in these markets any change in the leadership or politics of emerging market countries or the countries that exercise a significant influence over those countries may halt the expansion of or reverse the liberalization of foreign investment policies now occurring and adversely affect existing investment opportunities the small size limited trading volume and relative inexperience of the securities markets in these countries may make investments in securities traded in emerging markets illiquid and more volatile than investments in securities traded in more developed countries for example limited market size may cause prices to be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in addition the fund may be required to establish special custodial or other arrangements before making investments in securities traded in emerging markets there may be little financial or accounting information available with respect to issuers of emerging market securities and it may be difficult as a result to assess the value of prospects of an investment in such securities the risk also exists that an emergency situation may arise in one or more emerging markets as a result of which trading of securities may cease or may be substantially curtailed and prices for a funds securities in such markets may not be readily available a fund may suspend redemption of its shares for any period during which an emergency exists as determined by the sec accordingly if a fund believes that appropriate circumstances exist it may apply to the sec for a determination that an emergency is present during the period commencing from a funds identification of such condition until the date of the sec action a funds securities in the affected markets will be valued at fair value determined in good faith by or under the direction of a funds board  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th certain of the foregoing risks may also apply to some extent to securities of us issuers that are denominated in foreign currencies or that are traded in foreign markets or securities of us issuers having significant foreign operations high yieldhigh risk bonds a fund may also purchase to a limited extent debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities which usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk of principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the higher rating categories the lower the ratings of such debt securities the greater their risks render them like equity securities dws international fund will invest no more than  of its total assets in securities rated bb or lower by moodys or ba by sp and may invest in securities which are rated d by sp see the appendix to this statement of additional information for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations and their respective characteristics high yield highrisk securities are especially subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions to changes in the financial condition of their issuers and to price fluctuations in response to changes in interest rates an economic downturn could disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers to repay principal and interest also an increase in interest rates would have a greater adverse impact on the value of such obligations than on higher quality debt securities during an economic downturn or period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issues may experience financial stress which would adversely affect their ability to service their principal and interest payment obligations prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates the trading market for high yield securities may be thin to the extent that there is no established retail secondary market a thin trading market may limit the ability of a fund to accurately value high yield securities in its portfolio and to dispose of those securities adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of a funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of the fund to retain or dispose of such security prices for below investmentgrade securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments for example new federal rules require savings and loan institutions to gradually reduce their holdings of this type of security congress has from time to time considered legislation which would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in these securities and regulate corporate restructurings such legislation may significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type illiquid securities and restricted securities a fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended the  act issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid the funds boards have approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities a fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses a fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the  act when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event the fund may be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading a fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them a fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between a funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which a fund is permitted or able to sell such security the fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell this investment practice therefore could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity of a fund impact of large redemptions and purchases of fund shares from time to time shareholders of a fund which may include affiliated andor nonaffiliated registered investment companies that invest in a fund may make relatively large redemptions or purchases of fund shares these transactions may cause a fund to have to sell securities or invest additional cash as the case may be while it is impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time there could be adverse effects on a funds performance to the extent that a fund may be required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise do so these transactions could also accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales of securities resulted in capital gains and could also increase transaction costs which may impact a funds expense ratio ipo risk securities issued through an initial public offering ipo can experience an immediate drop in value if the demand for the securities does not continue to support the offering price information about the issuers of ipo securities is also difficult to acquire since they are new to the market and may not have lengthy operating histories a fund may engage in shortterm trading in connection with its ipo investments which could produce higher trading costs and adverse tax consequences the number of securities issued in an ipo is limited so it is likely that ipo securities will represent a smaller component of a funds portfolio as a funds assets increase and thus have a more limited effect on a funds performance interfund borrowing and lending program the funds have received exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission sec which permits the funds to participate in an interfund lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent the funds are actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund lending program the funds as a matter of nonfundamental policy may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that the funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose investment company securities a fund may acquire securities of other investment companies to the extent consistent with its investment objective and subject to the limitations of the  act a fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees and other expenses paid by such other investment companies for example a fund may invest in a variety of investment companies which seek to track the composition and performance of specific indexes or a specific portion of an index these indexbased investments hold substantially all of their assets in securities representing their specific index accordingly the main risk of investing in indexbased investments is the same as investing in a portfolio of equity securities comprising the index the market prices of indexbased investments will fluctuate in accordance with both changes in the market value of their underlying portfolio securities and due to supply and demand for the instruments on the exchanges on which they are traded which may result in their trading at a discount or premium to their navs indexbased investments may not replicate exactly the performance of their specified index because of transaction costs and because of the temporary unavailability of certain component securities of the index examples of indexbased

vehicles may exceed the limits of rule da lending of portfolio securities a fund may lend its investment securities to approved institutional borrowers including those who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions such as covering short sales avoiding failures to deliver securities or completing arbitrage operations by lending its investment securities a fund attempts to increase its net investment income through the receipt of interest on the loan any gain or loss in the market price of the securities loaned that might occur during the term of the loan would belong to the fund a fund may lend its investment securities so long as the terms structure and the aggregate amount of such loans are not inconsistent with the  act or the rules and regulations or interpretations of the sec thereunder which currently require that a the borrower pledge and maintain with the fund collateral consisting of liquid unencumbered assets having a value at all times not less than  of the value of the securities loaned b the borrower add to such collateral whenever the price of the securities loaned rises ie the borrower marks to the market on a daily basis c the loan be made subject to termination by the fund at any time and d the fund receives reasonable interest on the loan which may include the fund investing any cash collateral in interest bearing shortterm investments and distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in their market value there may be risks of delay in recovery of the securities or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by a funds delegate after a commercially reasonable review of relevant facts and circumstances including the creditworthiness of the borrower at the present time the staff of the sec does not object if an investment company pays reasonable negotiated fees in connection with loaned securities so long as such fees are set forth in a written contract and approved by the investment companys board of trusteesdirectors in addition voting rights may pass with the loaned securities but if a material event occurs affecting an investment on loan the loan must be called and the securities voted pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the sec cash collateral received by a fund may be invested in a money market fund managed by the advisor or one of its affiliates microcap companies while historically microcapitalization company stocks have outperformed the stocks of large companies the former have customarily involved more investment risk as well there can be no assurance that this will continue to be true in the future microcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies the prices of microcapitalization company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because microcapitalization companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for a fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices some of the companies in which a fund may invest may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the securities of microcapitalization companies are often traded overthecounter and may not be traded in the volumes typical on a national securities exchange consequently in order to sell this type of holding a fund may need to discount the securities from recent prices or dispose of the securities over a long period of time participation interests a fund may purchase from financial institutions participation interests in securities in which a fund may invest a participation interest gives a fund an undivided interest in the security in the proportion that a funds participation interest bears to the principal amount of the security these instruments may have fixed  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th floating or variable interest rates with remaining maturities of  days or less if the participation interest is unrated or has been given a rating below that which is permissible for purchase by a fund the participation interest will be backed by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of a bank or the payment obligation otherwise will be collateralized by us government securities or in the case of unrated participation interest determined by the advisor to be of comparable quality to those instruments in which a fund may invest for certain participation interests a fund will have the right to demand payment on not more than seven days notice for all or any part of a funds participation interests in the security plus accrued interest as to these instruments a fund generally intends to exercise its right to demand payment only upon a default under the terms of the security privatized enterprises investments in foreign securities may include securities issued by enterprises that have undergone or are currently undergoing privatization the governments of certain foreign countries have to varying degrees embarked on privatization programs contemplating the sale of all or part of their interests in state enterprises a funds investments in the securities of privatized enterprises may include privately negotiated investments in a government or stateowned or controlled company or enterprise that has not yet conducted an initial equity offering investments in the initial offering of equity securities of a state enterprise or former state enterprise and investments in the securities of a state enterprise following its initial equity offering in certain jurisdictions the ability of foreign entities such as a fund to participate in privatizations may be limited by local law or the price or terms on which a fund may be able to participate may be less advantageous than for local investors moreover there can be no assurance that governments that have embarked on privatization programs will continue to divest their ownership of state enterprises that proposed privatizations will be successful or that governments will not renationalize enterprises that have been privatized in the case of the enterprises in which a fund may invest large blocks of the stock of those enterprises may be held by a small group of stockholders even after the initial equity offerings by those enterprises the sale of some portion or all of those blocks could have an adverse effect on the price of the stock of any such enterprise prior to making an initial equity offering most state enterprises or former state enterprises go through an internal reorganization or management such reorganizations are made in an attempt to better enable these enterprises to compete in the private sector however certain reorganizations could result in a management team that does not function as well as an enterprises prior management and may have a negative effect on such enterprise in addition the privatization of an enterprise by its government may occur over a number of years with the government continuing to hold a controlling position in the enterprise even after the initial equity offering for the enterprise prior to privatization most of the state enterprises in which a fund may invest enjoy the protection of and receive preferential treatment from the respective sovereigns that own or control them after making an initial equity offering these enterprises may no longer have such protection or receive such preferential treatment and may become subject to market competition from which they were previously protected some of these enterprises may not be able to operate effectively in a competitive market and may suffer losses or experience bankruptcy due to such competition real estate investment trusts reits reits are sometimes informally characterized as equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits investment in reits may subject a fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate such as decreases in real estate values overbuilding increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions increases in operating costs and property taxes changes in zoning laws casualty or condemnation losses possible environmental liabilities regulatory limitations on rent and fluctuations in rental income equity reits generally experience these risks directly through fee or leasehold interests whereas mortgage reits generally experience these risks indirectly through mortgage interests unless the mortgage reit forecloses on the underlying real estate changes in interest rates may also affect the value of a funds investment in reits for instance during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those reits certain reits have relatively small market capitalizations which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of their securities furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills have limited  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th diversification and are therefore subject to risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and to maintain exemption from the registration requirements of the  act by investing in reits indirectly through a fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of a fund but also indirectly similar expenses of the reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders repurchase agreements a fund may invest in repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement a fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer some repurchase commitment transactions may not provide a fund with collateral markedtomarket during the term of the commitment a repurchase agreement provides a means for a fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie a fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and the value of such securities kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to a fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to a fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case the income to a fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by a fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by a fund or as being collateral for a loan by a fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement a fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation a fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor a fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt instrument purchased for a fund the advisor seeks to minimize the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case a fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to a fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value of the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest a fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price it is possible that a fund will be unsuccessful in seeking to enforce the sellers contractual obligation to deliver additional securities reverse repurchase agreements a fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which a fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase them at an agreed upon time and price a fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements are deemed to be borrowings subject to a funds investment restrictions applicable to that activity a fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuation in the market value of fund assets and their yields small company risk the advisor believes that many small companies may have sales and earnings growth rates which exceed those of larger companies and that such growth rates may in turn be reflected in more rapid share price appreciation over time however investing in smaller company stocks involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger more established companies for example smaller companies can have limited product lines markets or financial and managerial resources smaller companies may also be dependent on one or a few key persons and may be more susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy also the securities of smaller  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th companies may be thinly traded and therefore have to be sold at a discount from current market prices or sold in small lots over an extended period of time transaction costs in smaller company stocks may be higher than those of larger companies strategic transactions and derivatives a fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of the fixedincome securities in a funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies a fund may purchase and sell exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity and fixedincome indices and other instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors collars currency forward contracts currency futures contracts currency swaps or options on currencies or currency futures and various other currency transactions collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include additional techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit subject to certain limits imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for a funds portfolio resulting from securities markets or currency exchange rate fluctuations to protect a funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of a funds portfolio to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or for any other purpose permitted by applicable law some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of a funds assets will be committed to certain strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of a fund to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of a fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation a fund can realize on its investments or cause a fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in a fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of a funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets a fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchases of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium other strategic transactions such as forward contracts and swaps are also subject to similar risks losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance the funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving the fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price a funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect the fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto a fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties a fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting a fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to a fund at a formula price within seven days a fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although it is not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with a fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option a fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied the fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or in the case of otc currency transactions are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by a fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if a fund sells a call option the premium that it receives may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in its portfolio or will increase a funds income the sale of put options can also provide income a fund may purchase and sell call options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts all calls sold by a fund must be covered ie a fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by a fund exposes the fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require a fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold a fund may purchase and sell put options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments whether or not it holds the above securities in its portfolio and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities a fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that a fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures a fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate currency or equity market changes and for duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to certain instruments such as index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount and a firm obligation by the buyer to deliver the specified price options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position the funds have claimed exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act therefore the funds are not subject to commodity pool operator registration and regulation under the commodity exchange act futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires a fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the mark to market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of a fund if a fund exercises an option on a futures contract it  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur options on securities indices and other financial indices a fund also may purchase and sell call and put options on securities indices and other financial indices and in so doing can achieve many of the same objectives it would achieve through the sale or purchase of options on individual securities or other instruments options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option on an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making up the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities currency transactions a fund may engage in currency transactions with counterparties primarily in order to hedge or manage the risk of the value of portfolio holdings denominated in particular currencies against fluctuations in relative value currency transactions include forward currency contracts exchange listed currency futures exchange listed and otc options on currencies and currency swaps a forward currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows based on the notional difference among two or more currencies and operates similarly to an interest rate swap which is described below a fund may enter into currency transactions with counterparties which have received or the guarantors of the obligations which have received a credit rating of a or p by sp or moodys respectively or that have an equivalent rating from a nrsro or except for otc currency options are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor a funds dealings in forward currency contracts and other currency transactions such as futures options options on futures and swaps generally will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except as described below transaction hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of a fund which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of income therefrom position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency a fund generally will not enter into a transaction to hedge currency exposure to an extent greater after netting all transactions intended wholly or partially to offset other transactions than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the transaction of the securities held in its portfolio that are denominated or generally quoted in or currently convertible into such currency other than with respect to proxy hedging or cross hedging as described below as applicable a fund may also crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which a fund has or in which a fund expects to have portfolio exposure to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of portfolio securities a fund may also engage in proxy hedging proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which a funds portfolio is exposed is difficult to hedge or to hedge against the us dollar proxy hedging entails entering into a commitment or option to sell a currency whose changes in value are generally considered to be correlated to a currency or currencies in which some or all of a funds portfolio securities are or are expected to be denominated in exchange for us dollars the amount of the commitment or option would not exceed the value of a funds securities  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th denominated in correlated currencies currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments currency transactions can result in losses to a fund if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further there is the risk that the perceived correlation between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time that a fund is engaging in proxy hedging if a fund enters into a currency hedging transaction the fund will comply with the asset segregation requirements described below risks of currency transactions currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses to a fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs buyers and sellers of currency futures are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures is relatively new and the ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid market which may not always be available currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that countrys economy risks of strategic transactions outside the us when conducted outside the us strategic transactions may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in a funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which a fund may enter are interest rate currency index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars a fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique to protect against any increase in the price of securities a fund anticipates purchasing at a later date or to enhance returns a fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream a fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by a fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values use of segregated and other special accounts most strategic transactions and certain other instruments such as reverse repurchase agreements dollar rolls and whenissued securities expose the fund to an obligation to another party the fund will comply with sec guidelines regarding cover for these strategic transactions and instruments and will if the guidelines so require segregate on its books cash or liquid assets in the prescribed amount as determined daily the fund may also enter into offsetting transactions or own positions covering its obligations although this sai describes certain permitted methods of segregating assets or otherwise covering such transactions for these purposes such descriptions are not intended to be exhaustive the fund may cover such transactions using other methods currently or in the future permitted under the  act the rules and regulations thereunder or orders issued by the sec thereunder for these purposes interpretations and guidance provided by the sec staff may be taken into account when deemed appropriate by the fund to the extent that a fund covers its  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th commitment under strategic transactions and such other instruments including by segregation of liquid assets entering into offsetting transactions or owning positions covering its obligations such strategic transactions and instruments will not be considered a senior security by the fund and therefore will not be subject to the  asset coverage requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings by the fund assets used as cover cannot be sold while the position in the corresponding strategic transaction or other such instrument is open unless they are replaced with other appropriate assets as a result the commitment of a large portion of the funds assets to cover in accounts could impede portfolio management or the funds ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations combined transactions each fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single strategic transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the advisor it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisors judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective supranational entities supranational entities are international organizations designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development and international banking institutions and related government agencies examples include the international bank for reconstruction and development the world bank the european coal and steel community the asian development bank and the interamerican development bank obligations of supranational entities are backed by the guarantee of one or more foreign governmental parties which sponsor the entity trust preferred securities a fund may invest in trust preferred securities which are hybrid instruments issued by a special purpose trust the special trust the entire equity interest of which is owned by a single issuer the proceeds of the issuance to a fund of trust preferred securities are typically used to purchase a junior subordinated debenture and distributions from the special trust are funded by the payments of principal and interest on the subordinated debenture if payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures held by the special trust are deferred by the debenture issuer the debentures would be treated as original issue discount oid obligations for the remainder of their term as a result holders of trust preferred securities such as a fund would be required to

holdings us government securities there are two broad categories of us governmentrelated debt instruments a direct obligations of the us treasury and b securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies examples of direct obligations of the us treasury are treasury bills notes bonds and other debt securities issued by the us treasury these instruments are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states they differ primarily in interest rates the length of maturities and the dates of issuance treasury bills have original maturities of one year or less treasury notes have original maturities of one to ten years and treasury bonds generally have original maturities of greater than ten years  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th some agency securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states such as maritime administration title xi ship financing bonds and agency for international development housing guarantee program bonds and others are backed only by the rights of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury such as federal home loan bank bonds and federal national mortgage association bonds while still others such as the securities of the federal farm credit bank are supported only by the credit of the issuer with respect to securities supported only by the credit of the issuing agency or by an additional line of credit with the us treasury there is no guarantee that the us government will provide support to such agencies and such securities may involve risk of loss of principal and interest us government securities may include zero coupon securities that have been stripped by the us government of their unmatured interest coupons and collateralized obligations issued or guaranteed by a us government agency or instrumentality interest rates on us government obligations may be fixed or variable interest rates on variable rate obligations are adjusted at regular intervals at least annually according to a formula reflecting then current specified standard rates such as day us treasury bill rates these adjustments generally tend to reduce fluctuations in the market value of the securities the government guarantee of the us government securities in a funds portfolio does not guarantee the net asset value of the shares of a fund there are market risks inherent in all investments in securities and the value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate over time normally the value of investments in us government securities varies inversely with changes in interest rates for example as interest rates rise the value of investments in us government securities will tend to decline and as interest rates fall the value of a funds investments will tend to increase in addition the potential for appreciation in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited or negated by increased principal prepayments with respect to certain mortgagebacked securities such as gnma certificates prepayments of high interest rate mortgagebacked securities during times of declining interest rates will tend to lower the return of a fund and may even result in losses to a fund if some securities were acquired at a premium moreover during periods of rising interest rates prepayments of mortgagebacked securities may decline resulting in the extension of a funds average portfolio maturity as a result a funds portfolio may experience greater volatility during periods of rising interest rates than under normal market conditions warrants the holder of a warrant has the right until the warrant expires to purchase a given number of shares of a particular issuer at a specified price such investments can provide a greater potential for profit or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security prices of warrants do not necessarily move in tandem with the prices of the underlying securities however and are therefore considered speculative investments warrants pay no dividends and confer no rights other than a purchase option thus if a warrant held by a fund were not exercised by the date of its expiration a fund would lose the entire purchase price of the warrant whenissued securities a fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued delayed delivery or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund when the fund purchases such securities it immediately assumes the risks of ownership including the risk of price fluctuation failure to deliver a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment to the extent that assets of the fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities the fund would earn no income while such securities may be sold prior to the settlement date the fund intends to purchase them with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on this basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the securities may be more or less than the purchase price zero coupon securities a fund may invest in zero coupon securities which pay no cash income and are sold at substantial discounts from their value at maturity when held to maturity their entire income which consists of  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th accretion of discount comes from the difference between the issue price and their value at maturity zero coupon securities are subject to greater market value fluctuations from changing interest rates than debt obligations of comparable maturities which make current distributions of interest cash zero coupon securities which are convertible into common stock offer the opportunity for capital appreciation as increases or decreases in market value of such securities closely follows the movements in the market value of the underlying common stock zero coupon convertible securities generally are expected to be less volatile than the underlying common stocks as they usually are issued with maturities of  years or less and are issued with options andor redemption features exercisable by the holder of the obligation entitling the holder to redeem the obligation and receive a defined cash payment zero coupon securities include securities issued directly by the us treasury and us treasury bonds or notes and their unmatured interest coupons and receipts for their underlying principal coupons which have been separated by their holder typically a custodian bank or investment brokerage firm a holder will separate the interest coupons from the underlying principal the corpus of the us treasury security a number of securities firms and banks have stripped the interest coupons and receipts and then resold them in custodial receipt programs with a number of different names including treasury income growth receipts tigrstm and certificate of accrual on treasuries catstm the underlying us treasury bonds and notes themselves are held in bookentry form at the federal reserve bank or in the case of bearer securities ie unregistered securities which are owned ostensibly by the bearer or holder thereof in trust on behalf of the owners thereof counsel to the underwriters of these certificates or other evidences of ownership of the us treasury securities have stated that for federal tax and securities purposes in their opinion purchasers of such certificates such as a fund most likely will be deemed the beneficial holder of the underlying us government securities a fund understands that the staff of the division of investment management of the sec no longer considers such privately stripped obligations to be us government securities as defined in the  act therefore a fund intends to adhere to this staff position and will not treat such privately stripped obligations to be us government securities for the purpose of determining if a fund is diversified under the  act the us treasury has facilitated transfers of ownership of zero coupon securities by accounting separately for the beneficial ownership of particular interest coupon and corpus payments on treasury securities through the federal reserve bookentry record keeping system the federal reserve program as established by the treasury department is known as strips or separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities under the strips program a fund will be able to have its beneficial ownership of zero coupon securities recorded directly in the bookentry recordkeeping system in lieu of having to hold certificates or other evidences of ownership of the underlying us treasury securities when us treasury obligations have been stripped of their unmatured interest coupons by the holder the principal or corpus is sold at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a future fixed payment on the security and does not receive any rights to periodic interest cash payments once stripped or separated the corpus and coupons may be sold separately typically the coupons are sold separately or grouped with other coupons with like maturity dates and sold bundled in such form purchasers of stripped obligations acquire in effect discount obligations that are economically identical to the zero coupon securities that the treasury sells itself portfolio holdings

apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager has daytoday portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund or account including the following o certain investments may be appropriate for the fund and also for other clients advised by the advisor including other client accounts managed by the funds portfolio manager investment decisions for the fund and other clients are made with a view to achieving their respective investment objectives and after consideration of such factors as their current holdings availability of cash for investment and the size of their investments generally a particular security may be bought or sold for only one client or in different amounts and at different times for more than one but less than all clients likewise because clients of the advisor may have differing investment strategies a particular security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling the security the investment results achieved for the fund may differ from the results achieved for other clients of the advisor in addition purchases or sales of the same security may be made for two or more clients on the same day in such event such transactions will be allocated among the clients in a manner believed by the advisor to be most equitable to each client generally utilizing a pro rata allocation methodology in some cases the allocation procedure could potentially have an adverse effect or positive effect on the price or amount of the securities purchased or sold by the fund purchase and sale orders for the fund may be combined with those of other clients of the advisor in the interest of achieving the most favorable net results to the fund and the other clients o to the extent that a portfolio manager has responsibilities for managing multiple client accounts a portfolio manager will need to divide time and attention among relevant accounts the advisor attempts to minimize these conflicts by aligning its portfolio management teams by investment strategy and by employing similar investment models across multiple client accounts o in some cases an apparent conflict may arise where the advisor has an incentive such as a performancebased fee in managing one account and not with respect to other accounts it manages the advisor will not determine allocations based on whether it receives a performancebased fee from the client additionally the advisor has in place supervisory oversight processes to periodically monitor performance deviations for accounts with like strategies o the advisor and its affiliates and the investment team of the fund may manage other mutual funds and separate accounts on a longshort basis the simultaneous management of long and short

mitigate these potential conflicts of interest included in these procedures are specific guidelines developed to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all clients whose accounts are managed by each

by the fund in connection with the investment of fiduciary assets in class r shares of the fund service organizations that are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec the department of labor or state securities commissions are urged to consult their own legal advisors before investing fiduciary assets in class r shares of the fund and receiving service fees the corporations believe that fiduciaries of erisa plans may properly receive fees under the service plan if the plan fiduciary otherwise properly discharges its fiduciary duties including if applicable those under erisa under erisa a plan fiduciary such as a trustee or investment manager must meet the fiduciary responsibility standards set forth in part  of title i of erisa those standards are designed to help ensure that the fiduciarys decisions are made in the best interests of the plan and are not colored by selfinterest section c of erisa provides in part that the assets of a plan shall be held for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the plans participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan section a sets forth a similar requirement on how a plan fiduciary must discharge his or her duties with respect to the plan and provides further that such fiduciary must act prudently and solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries these basic provisions are supplemented by the per se prohibitions of certain classes of transactions set forth in section  of erisa section ad of erisa prohibits a fiduciary of an erisa plan from causing that plan to engage in a transaction if he knows or should know that the transaction would constitute a direct or indirect transfer to or use by or for the benefit of a party in interest of any assets of that plan section  includes within the definition of party in interest with respect to a plan any fiduciary with respect to that plan thus section ad would not only prohibit a fiduciary from causing the plan to engage in a transaction which would benefit a third person who is a party in interest but it would also prohibit the fiduciary from similarly benefiting himself in addition section b specifically prohibits a fiduciary with respect to a plan from dealing with the assets of that plan in  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th his own interest or for his own account section b supplements these provisions by prohibiting a plan fiduciary from receiving any consideration for his own personal account from any party dealing with the plan in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the plan in accordance with the foregoing however a fiduciary of an erisa plan may properly receive service fees under the service plan if the fees are used for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the plans participants and their beneficiaries or for defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan for which the plan would otherwise be liable see eg department of labor erisa technical release no  stating a violation of erisa would not occur where a brokerdealer rebates commission dollars to a plan fiduciary who in turn reduces its fees for which plan is otherwise responsible for paying thus the fiduciary duty issues involved in a plan fiduciarys receipt of the service fee must be assessed on a casebycase basis by the relevant plan fiduciary portfolio transactions the advisor is generally responsible for placing the orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities including the allocation of brokerage with respect to those funds for which a subinvestment advisor manages the funds investments references in this section to the advisor should be read to mean the subadvisor except as noted below the policy of the advisor in placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities for the funds is to seek best execution taking into account such factors among others as price commission where applicable the brokerdealers ability to ensure that securities will be delivered on settlement date the willingness of the brokerdealer to commit its capital and purchase a thinly traded security for its own inventory whether the brokerdealer specializes in block orders or large program trades the brokerdealers knowledge of the market and the security the brokerdealers ability to maintain confidentiality the brokerdealers ability to provide access to new issues the brokerdealers ability to provide support when placing a difficult trade the financial condition of the brokerdealer and whether the brokerdealer has the infrastructure and operational capabilities to execute and settle the trade the advisor seeks to evaluate the overall reasonableness of brokerage commissions with commissions charged on comparable transactions and compares the brokerage commissions if any paid by the funds to reported commissions paid by others the advisor routinely reviews commission rates execution and settlement services performed and makes internal and external comparisons commission rates on transactions in equity securities on us securities exchanges are subject to negotiation commission rates on transactions in equity securities on foreign securities exchanges are generally fixed purchases and sales of fixedincome securities and certain overthecounter securities are effected on a net basis without the payment of brokerage commissions transactions in fixed income and certain overthecounter securities are generally placed by the advisor with the principal market makers for these securities unless the advisor reasonably believes more favorable results are available elsewhere transactions with dealers serving as market makers reflect the spread between the bid and asked prices purchases of underwritten issues will include an underwriting fee paid to the underwriter money market instruments are normally purchased in principal transactions directly from the issuer or from an underwriter or market maker it is likely that the brokerdealers selected based on the considerations described in this section will include firms that also sell shares of the funds to their customers however the advisor does not consider sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds and accordingly has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds the advisor is permitted by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  act when placing portfolio transactions for a fund to cause the fund to pay brokerage commissions in excess of that which another brokerdealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain research and brokerage services if the advisor determines that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the overall services provided the advisor may from time to time in reliance on section e of the  act execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers that provide research and brokerage services

pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th particular trade the advisor may take into consideration the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the brokerdealer to execute the trade although certain research and brokerage services from brokerdealers may be useful to a fund and to the advisor it is the opinion of the advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since the information must still be analyzed weighed and reviewed by the advisors staff to the extent that research and brokerage services of value are received by the advisor the advisor may avoid expenses that it might otherwise incur research and brokerage services received from a brokerdealer may be useful to the advisor and its affiliates in providing investment management services to all or some of its clients which includes a fund services received from brokerdealers that executed securities transactions for a portfolio will not necessarily be used by the advisor specifically to

statistical information accounting and tax law interpretations political developments legal developments affecting portfolio securities technical market action pricing and appraisal services credit analysis risk measurement analysis performance analysis and measurement and analysis of corporate responsibility issues research and brokerage services are typically received in the form of written or electronic reports access to specialized financial publications telephone contacts and personal meetings with security analysts but may also be provided in the form of access to various computer software and meetings arranged with corporate and industry representatives the advisor may also select brokerdealers and obtain from them research and brokerage services that are used in connection with executing trades provided that such services are consistent with interpretations under section e of the  act typically these services take the form of computer software andor electronic communication services used by the advisor to facilitate trading activity with those brokerdealers research and brokerage services may include products obtained from third parties if the advisor determines that such product or service constitutes brokerage and research as defined in section e and interpretations thereunder currently it is the advisors policy that subadvisors may not execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the funds to obtain third party research and brokerage services the advisor may in the future change this policy regardless certain subadvisors may as matter of internal policy limit or preclude third party research and brokerage services the advisor may use brokerage commissions to obtain certain brokerage products or services that have a mixed use ie it also serves a function that does not relate to the investment decisionmaking process in those circumstances the advisor will make a good faith judgment to evaluate the various benefits and uses to which it intends to put the mixed use product or service and will pay for that portion of the mixed use product or service that it reasonably believes does not constitute research and brokerage services with its own resources dima will monitor regulatory developments and market practice in the use of client commissions to obtain research and brokerage services and may adjust its portfolio transactions policies in response thereto investment decisions for each fund and for other investment accounts managed by the advisor are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions however the same investment decision may be made for two or more of such accounts in such cases simultaneous transactions are inevitable to the extent permitted by law the advisor may aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased for a fund with those to be sold or purchased for other accounts in executing transactions purchases or sales are then averaged as to price and commission and allocated as to amount in a manner deemed equitable to each account while in some cases this practice could have a detrimental effect on the price paid or received by or on the size of

should a distribution reduce the net asset value below a shareholders cost basis such distribution would nevertheless be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above even though from an investment standpoint it may constitute a partial return of capital in particular investors should be careful to consider the tax implications of buying shares just prior to

the market as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in those pfics on the last day of the funds taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by a fund to avoid taxation making either of these elections therefore may require such fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the funds total return dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income taxation of certain investments a funds investment in zero coupon

these securities this original issue discount imputed income will comprise a part of the investment company taxable income of a fund which must be distributed to shareholders in order to maintain the

issuance and all zerocoupon debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance that are acquired by a fund will be treated as debt obligations that are issued originally at a discount generally the amount of the original issue discount oid is treated as interest income and is included in taxable income and required to be distributed over the term of the debt security even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time usually when the debt security matures in addition paymentinkind securities will give rise to income which is required to be distributed and is taxable even though a fund holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date

partial payment of principal on a debt security having market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain or principal payment does not exceed the accrued market discount on such debt security market discount generally accrues in equal daily installments a fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt obligations having market discount which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income in addition if a fund invests in high yield original issue discount obligations issued by corporations including taxexempt obligations a portion of the original issue discount accruing on the obligation may be treated as taxable dividend income in such event dividends of investment company taxable income received from a fund by its shareholders to

obligations that are in the lowest rating categories or are unrated including debt obligations of issuers not currently paying interest or who are in default investments in debt obligations that are at risk of or in default present special tax issues for a fund tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when a fund may cease to accrue interest original issue discount or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income these and other related issues will be addressed by a fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax if a fund engages in hedging transactions including hedging transactions in options futures contracts and straddles or other similar transactions it will be subject to special tax rules including constructive sale marktomarket straddle wash sale and short sale rules the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the fund defer losses to the fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of the funds securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains or convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders such fund will endeavor to make any available elections pertaining to such transactions in a manner believed to be in the best interests of the fund certain of a funds hedging activities may produce a difference between its book income and the sum of its net taxexempt and taxable income if a funds book income exceeds its taxexempt income the distribution if any of such excess will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the funds remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipients basis in the shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if a funds book income is less than the sum of its net taxexempt and taxable income such fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a

deductions for dividends paid by the fund under legislation enacted in december  if a charitable remainder trust defined in section  of the code realizes any unrelated business taxable income for a taxable year it must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such ubti under irs guidance issued in november  a charitable remainder trust will not recognize ubti solely as a result of

delegated proxy voting to the advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted consistent with each funds best economic interests the advisor has adopted its own proxy voting policies and procedures policies and proxy voting guidelines guidelines for this purpose the policies address among other things conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the funds and the interests of the advisor and its affiliates including the funds principal underwriter the guidelines set forth the advisors general position on various proposals such as o shareholder rights  the advisor generally votes against proposals that restrict shareholder rights o corporate governance  the advisor generally votes for confidential and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements for charter and bylaw amendments the advisor generally votes for proposals to restrict a chief executive officer from serving on more than three outside boards of directors the advisor generally votes against proposals that require a company to appoint a chairman who is an independent director o antitakeover matters  the advisor generally votes for proposals that require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that request boards to redeem poison pills and votes against the adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder ratification the advisor generally votes for fair price proposals o compensation matters  the advisor generally votes for executive cash compensation proposals unless they are unreasonably excessive the advisor generally votes against stock option plans that do not meet the advisors criteria o routine matters  the advisor generally votes for the ratification of auditors procedural matters related to the annual meeting and changes in company name and against bundled proposals and adjournment the general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies the advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment companies in accordance with the recommendations of an independent third party except for proxies solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment advisor or principal underwriter affiliated investment companies the advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies in the same proportion as the vote of the investment companys other shareholders sometimes called mirror or echo voting master fund proxies solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements of the investment company act of  although the guidelines set forth the advisors general voting positions on various proposals the advisor may consistent with the funds best interests determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions the guidelines on a particular issue may or may not reflect the view of individual members of the board or of a majority of the board in addition the guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices of the public companies within the deutsche bank organization or of the investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment advisor or sponsor the advisor may consider the views of a portfolio companys management in deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the guidelines but managements views are not determinative  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th as mentioned above the policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves conflicts of interest to resolve conflicts the advisor under normal circumstances votes proxies in accordance with its guidelines if the advisor departs from the guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal a proxy voting committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy before voting any such proxy however the advisors conflicts review committee will conduct an investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in connection with the particular proxy proposal if the conflicts review committee determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest or certain individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating in a particular proxy vote it will inform the proxy voting committee if notified that the advisor has a material conflict or fewer than three voting members are eligible to participate in the proxy vote typically the advisor will engage an independent third party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy voting recommendations of an independent third party under certain circumstances the advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the advisor may find that the expected economic costs from voting outweigh the benefits associated with voting for example the advisor may not vote proxies on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs the advisor generally does not vote proxies on securities subject to share blocking restrictions you may obtain information about how a fund voted proxies related to its portfolio securities during the month period ended

secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because

currently a low expectation of credit risk the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity this is the lowest investmentgrade category bb speculative bb ratings indicate that there is a possibility of credit risk developing particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time however business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met securities rated in this category are not investment grade b

volatility and the risk of loss in a declining market borrowing by a fund will involve special risk considerations the funds assets may change in value during the time a borrowing is outstanding thus increasing exposure to capital risk common stocks common stock is issued by companies to raise cash for business purposes and represents a proportionate interest in the issuing companies therefore a

historically offered a greater potential for longterm gain on investment compared to other classes of financial assets such as bonds or cash equivalents although there can be no assurance that this will be true in the future convertible securities a fund may invest in convertible securities that is bonds notes debentures preferred stocks and other securities which are convertible into common stock investments in convertible securities can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation andor income through interest and dividend payments by virtue of their conversion or exchange features the convertible securities in which a fund may invest are either fixed income or zero coupon debt securities which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying shares of common stock the exchange ratio for any particular convertible security may be adjusted from time to time due to stock splits dividends spinoffs other corporate distributions or scheduled changes in the exchange ratio convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stocks until converted have general characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities although to a lesser extent than with debt securities generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely tends to increase as interest rates decline in addition because of the conversion or exchange feature the market value of convertible securities typically changes as the market value of the underlying common stocks changes and therefore also tends to follow movements in the general market for equity securities a unique feature of convertible securities is that as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the prices of the convertible securities tend to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock although typically not as much as the underlying common stock while no securities investments are without risk investments in convertible securities generally entail less risk than investments in common stock of the same issuer as debt securities convertible securities are investments which provide for a stream of income or in the case of zero coupon securities accretion of income with generally higher yields than common stocks convertible securities generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality because of their conversion or exchange features of course like all debt securities there can be no assurance of income or principal payments because the issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations convertible securities generally are subordinated to other similar but nonconvertible securities of the same issuer although convertible bonds as corporate debt obligations enjoy seniority in right of payment to all equity securities and convertible preferred stock is senior to common stock of the same issuer however because of the subordination feature convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock typically have lower ratings than similar nonconvertible securities convertible securities may be issued as fixed income obligations that pay current income or as zero coupon notes and bonds including liquid yield option notes lyontm corporate obligations investment in corporate debt obligations involves credit and interest rate risk the value of fixedincome investments will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and bond market conditions tending to rise as interest rates decline and to decline as interest rates rise corporate debt obligations generally offer less current yield than securities of lower quality but lowerquality securities generally have less liquidity greater credit and market risk and as a result more price volatility longerterm bonds are however generally more volatile than bonds with shorter maturities depositary receipts a fund may invest in sponsored or unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs international depositary receipts idrs and other types of depositary receipts which

receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they may also be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation generally depositary receipts in registered form are designed for use in the united states securities markets and depositary receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities markets outside the united states for purposes of a funds investment policies a funds investments in adrs gdrs and other types of depositary receipts will be deemed to be investments in the underlying securities depositary receipts including those denominated in us dollars will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk however by investing in us dollardenominated adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock a fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period in general there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs however certain depositary receipts may not be listed on an exchange and therefore may be illiquid securities dollar roll transactions dollar roll transactions consist of the sale by a fund to a bank or brokerdealer the counterparty of gnma certificates or other mortgagebacked securities together with a commitment to purchase from the counterparty similar but not identical securities at a future date at the same price the counterparty receives all principal and interest payments including prepayments made on the security while it is the holder a fund receives a fee from the counterparty as consideration for entering into the commitment to purchase dollar rolls may be renewed over a period of several months with a different purchase and repurchase price fixed and a cash settlement made at each renewal without physical delivery of securities moreover the transaction may be preceded by a firm commitment agreement pursuant to which a fund agrees to buy a security on a future date a fund will segregate cash us government securities or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to meet their purchase obligations under the transactions a fund will also maintain asset coverage to the extent required by the  act dollar rolls may be treated for purposes of the  act as borrowings of a fund because they involve the sale of a security coupled with an agreement to repurchase a dollar roll involves costs to a fund for example while a fund receives a fee as consideration for agreeing to repurchase the security a fund forgoes the right to receive all principal and interest payments while the counterparty holds the security these payments to the counterparty may exceed the fee received by a fund thereby effectively charging a fund interest on its borrowing further although a fund can estimate the amount of expected principal prepayment over the term of the dollar roll a variation in the actual amount of prepayment could increase or decrease the cost of a funds borrowing the entry into dollar rolls involves potential risks of loss that are different from those related to the securities underlying the transactions for example if the counterparty becomes insolvent a funds right to purchase from the counterparty might be restricted additionally the value of such securities may change adversely before a fund is able to purchase them similarly a fund may be required to purchase securities in connection with a dollar roll at a higher price than may otherwise be available on the open market since as noted above the counterparty is required to deliver a similar but not identical security to a fund the security that a fund is required to buy under the dollar roll may be worth less than an identical security finally there can be no assurance that a funds use of the cash that it receives from a dollar roll will provide a return that exceeds borrowing costs euro the implementation of the euro may result in uncertainties for european securities and the operation of a fund the euro was introduced on january   by eleven members countries of the european economic and monetary union emu implementation of the euro requires the redenomination of european debt and equity securities over a period of time which may result in various accounting differences andor tax treatments which would not otherwise occur additional questions are raised by the fact that certain other european community members including the united kingdom did not officially implement the euro on january   eurodollar instruments a fund may make investments in eurodollar instruments for hedging purposes or to enhance potential gain eurodollar instruments are us dollardenominated futures contracts or options thereon which are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor although foreign currencydenominated  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th instruments are available from time to time eurodollar futures contracts enable purchasers to obtain a fixed rate for the lending of funds and sellers to obtain a fixed rate for borrowings a fund might use eurodollar futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in libor to which many interest rate swaps and fixed income instruments are linked or for any other purpose eurodollar obligations eurodollar bank obligations are us dollardenominated certificates of deposit and time deposits issued outside the us capital markets by foreign branches of us banks and us branches of foreign banks eurodollar obligations are subject to the same risks that pertain to domestic issues notably credit risk market risk and liquidity risk additionally eurodollar obligations are subject to certain sovereign risks foreign currencies because investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries and because a fund may hold foreign currencies and forward contracts futures contracts options on foreign currencies and foreign currency futures contracts and other currencyrelated instruments the value of the assets of a fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and a fund may incur costs and experience conversion difficulties and uncertainties in connection with conversions between various currencies fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the earning power and asset value of the foreign entity issuing the security the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies is responsible for part of a funds investment performance if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen for example the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall many foreign currencies have experienced significant devaluation relative to the dollar although a fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to a fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should a fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer a fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into options or forward or futures contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies foreign fixed income securities since most foreign fixed income securities are not rated a fund will invest in foreign fixed income securities based on the advisors analysis without relying on published ratings since such investments will be based upon the advisors analysis rather than upon published ratings achievement of a funds goals may depend more upon the abilities of the advisor than would otherwise be the case the value of the foreign fixed income securities held by a fund and thus the net asset value of a funds shares generally will fluctuate with a changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the issuers of those securities b movements in interest rates and c changes in the relative values of the currencies in which a funds investments in fixed income securities are denominated with respect to the us dollar the extent of the fluctuation will depend on various factors such as the average maturity of a funds investments in foreign fixed income securities and the extent to which a fund hedges its interest rate credit and currency exchange rate risks a longer average maturity generally is associated with a higher level of volatility in the market value of such securities in response to changes in market conditions investments in sovereign debt including brady bonds brady bonds are debt securities issued under a plan implemented to allow debtor nations to restructure their outstanding commercial bank indebtedness involve special risks foreign governmental issuers of debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or pay interest when due in the event of default there may be limited or no legal recourse in that generally remedies for defaults must be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party political conditions especially a sovereign entitys willingness to meet the terms of its fixed income securities are of considerable significance also there can be no assurance that the holders of commercial bank loans to the same sovereign entity may not contest payments to the holders of sovereign debt in the event of default under commercial  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st bank loan agreements in addition there is no bankruptcy proceeding with respect to sovereign debt on which a sovereign has defaulted and a fund may be unable to collect all or any part of its investment in a particular issue foreign investment in certain sovereign debt is restricted or controlled to varying degrees including requiring governmental approval for the repatriation of income capital or proceed of sales by foreign investors these restrictions or controls may at times limit or preclude foreign investment in certain sovereign debt or increase the costs and expenses of a fund sovereign debt of emerging market governmental issuers is to be considered speculative emerging market governmental issuers are among the largest debtors to commercial banks foreign governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions certain emerging market governmental issuers have not been able to make payments of interest on or principal of debt obligations as those payments have come due there is a history of defaults with respect to commercial bank loans by public and private entities issuing sovereign debt all or a portion of the interest payments andor principal repayment with respect to sovereign debt may be uncollateralized obligations arising from past restructuring agreements may affect the economic performance and political and social stability of those issuers the ability of emerging market country governmental issuers to make timely payments on their obligations is likely to be influenced strongly by the issuers balance of payments including export performance and its access to international credits and investments an emerging market whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities could be vulnerable to a decline in the international prices of one or more of those commodities increased protectionism on the part of an emerging markets trading partners could also adversely affect the countrys exports and diminish its trade account surplus if any to the extent that emerging markets receive payment for its exports in currencies other than dollars or nonemerging market currencies its ability to make debt payments denominated in dollars or nonemerging market currencies could be affected another factor bearing on the ability of emerging market countries to repay debt obligations is the level of international reserves of the country fluctuations in the level of these reserves affect the amount of foreign exchange readily available for external debt payments and thus could have a bearing on the capacity of emerging market countries to make payments on these debt obligations to the extent that an emerging market country cannot generate a trade surplus it must depend on continuing loans from foreign governments multilateral organizations or private commercial banks aid payments from foreign governments and inflows of foreign investment the access of emerging markets to these forms of external funding may not be certain and a withdrawal of external funding could adversely affect the capacity of emerging market country governmental issuers to make payments on their obligations in addition the cost of servicing emerging market debt obligations can be affected by a change in international interest rates since the majority of these obligations carry interest rates that are adjusted periodically based upon international rates foreign investments foreign securities are normally denominated and traded in foreign currencies as a result the value of the funds foreign investments and the value of its shares may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar there may be less information publicly available about a foreign issuer than about a us issuer and foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the us the securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers foreign brokerage commissions and other fees are also generally higher than in the us foreign settlement procedures and trade regulations may involve certain risks such as delay in payment or delivery of securities or in the recovery of the funds assets held abroad and expenses not present in the settlement of investments in us markets payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition foreign securities may be subject to the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets imposition of currency exchange controls or restrictions on the repatriation of foreign currency confiscatory taxation political or financial instability and diplomatic developments which could affect the value of the funds investments in certain foreign countries governments of many countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector through the ownership or control of many companies including some of the largest in these countries as a result government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd conditions which may adversely affect prices of certain portfolio securities there is also generally less government supervision and regulation of stock exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the us dividends or interest on or proceeds from the sale of foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes and special us tax considerations may apply moreover foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position legal remedies available to investors in certain foreign countries may be more limited than those available with respect to investments in the us or in other foreign countries the laws of some foreign countries may limit the funds ability to invest in securities of certain issuers organized under the laws of those foreign countries of particular importance many foreign countries are heavily dependent upon exports particularly to developed countries and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the us and other countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by economic conditions in the us and other trading partners which can lower the demand for goods produced in those countries the risks described above including the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets typically are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets for example political and economic structures in these countries may be in their infancy and developing rapidly and such countries may lack the social political and economic stability characteristic of more developed countries including amplified risk of war and terrorism certain of these countries have in the past failed to recognize private property rights and have at times nationalized and expropriated the assets of private companies investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative the currencies of certain emerging market countries have experienced devaluations relative to the us dollar and future devaluations may adversely affect the value of assets denominated in such currencies in addition currency hedging techniques may be unavailable in certain emerging market countries many emerging market countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation or deflation for many years and future inflation may adversely affect the economies and securities markets of such countries in addition unanticipated political or social developments may affect the value of investments in emerging markets and the availability of additional investments in these markets any change in the leadership or politics of emerging market countries or the countries that exercise a significant influence over those countries may halt the expansion of or reverse the liberalization of foreign investment policies now occurring and adversely affect existing investment opportunities the small size limited trading volume and relative inexperience of the securities markets in these countries may make investments in securities traded in emerging markets illiquid and more volatile than investments in securities traded in more developed countries for example limited market size may cause prices to be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in addition the fund may be required to establish special custodial or other arrangements before making investments in securities traded in emerging markets there may be little financial or accounting information available with respect to issuers of emerging market securities and it may be difficult as a result to assess the value of prospects of an investment in such securities the risk also exists that an emergency situation may arise in one or more emerging markets as a result of which trading of securities may cease or may be substantially curtailed and prices for a funds securities in such markets may not be readily available a fund may suspend redemption of its shares for any period during which an emergency exists as determined by the sec accordingly if a fund believes that appropriate circumstances exist it may apply to the sec for a determination that an emergency is present during the period commencing from a funds identification of such condition until the date of the sec action a funds securities in the affected markets will be valued at fair value determined in good faith by or under the direction of a funds board certain of the foregoing risks may also apply to some extent to securities of us issuers that are denominated in foreign currencies or that are traded in foreign markets

which are rated below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities which usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk of principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the

in securities rated bb or lower by moodys or ba by sp and may invest in securities which are rated d by sp see the appendix to this statement of additional information for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations and their respective characteristics high yield highrisk securities are especially subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions to changes in the financial condition of their issuers and to price fluctuations in response to changes in interest rates an economic downturn could disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers to repay principal and interest also an increase in interest rates would have a greater adverse impact on the value of such obligations than on higher quality debt securities during an economic downturn or period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issues may experience financial stress which would adversely affect their ability to service their principal and interest payment obligations prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates the trading market for high yield securities may be thin to the extent that there is no established retail secondary market a thin trading market may limit the ability of a fund to accurately value high yield securities in its portfolio and to dispose of those securities adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of a funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of the fund to retain or dispose of such security prices for below investmentgrade securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments for example new federal rules require savings and loan institutions to gradually reduce their holdings of this type of security congress has from time to time considered legislation which would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in these securities and regulate corporate restructurings such legislation may significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type illiquid securities and restricted securities a fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended the  act issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid the funds boards have approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities a fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses a fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the  act when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event a fund may be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading a fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them a fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between a funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which a fund is permitted or able to sell such security the fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell this investment practice therefore could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity of a fund impact of large redemptions and purchases of fund shares from time to time shareholders of a fund which may include affiliated andor nonaffiliated registered investment companies that invest in a fund may make relatively large redemptions or purchases of fund shares these transactions may cause a fund to have to sell securities or invest additional cash as the case may be while it is impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time there could be adverse effects on a funds performance to the extent that a fund may be required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise do so these transactions could also accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales of securities resulted in capital gains and could also increase transaction costs which may impact a funds expense ratio ipo risk securities issued through an initial public offering ipo can experience an immediate drop in value if the demand for the securities does not continue to support the offering price information about the issuers of ipo securities is also difficult to acquire since they are new to the market and may not have lengthy operating histories a fund may engage in shortterm trading in connection with its ipo investments which could produce higher trading costs and adverse tax consequences the number of securities issued in an ipo is limited so it is likely that ipo securities will represent a smaller component of a funds portfolio as a funds assets increase and thus have a more limited effect on a funds performance interfund borrowing and lending program the funds have received exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission sec which permits the funds to participate in an interfund lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent the funds are actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund lending program the funds as a matter of nonfundamental policy may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that the funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th investment company securities a fund may acquire securities of other investment companies to the extent consistent with its investment objective and subject to the limitations of the  act a fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees and other expenses paid by such other investment companies for example a fund may invest in a variety of investment companies which seek to track the composition and performance of specific indexes or a specific portion of an index these indexbased investments hold substantially all of their assets in securities representing their specific index accordingly the main risk of investing in indexbased investments is the same as investing in a portfolio of equity securities comprising the index the market prices of indexbased investments will fluctuate in accordance with both changes in the market value of their underlying portfolio securities and due to supply and demand for the instruments on the exchanges on which they are traded which may result in their trading at a discount or premium to

stocks of large companies the former have customarily involved more investment risk as well there can be no assurance that this will continue to be true in the future microcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies the prices of microcapitalization company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because microcapitalization companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for a fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices some of the companies in which a fund may invest may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the securities of microcapitalization companies are often traded overthecounter and may not be traded in the volumes typical on a national securities exchange consequently in order to sell this type of holding a fund may need to discount the securities from recent prices or dispose of the securities over a long period of time participation interests a fund may purchase from financial institutions participation interests in securities in which a fund may invest a participation interest

former state enterprise and investments in the securities of a state enterprise following its initial equity offering in certain jurisdictions the ability of foreign entities such as a fund to participate in privatizations may be limited by local law or the price or terms on which a fund may be able to participate may be less advantageous than for local investors moreover there can be no assurance that governments that have embarked on privatization programs will continue to divest their ownership of state enterprises that proposed privatizations will be successful or that governments will not renationalize enterprises that have been privatized in the case of the enterprises in which a fund may invest large blocks of the stock of those enterprises may be held by a small group of stockholders even after the initial equity offerings by those enterprises the sale of some portion or all of those blocks could have an adverse effect on the price of the stock of any such enterprise prior to making an initial equity offering most state enterprises or former state enterprises go through an internal reorganization or management such reorganizations are made in an attempt to better enable these enterprises to compete in the private sector however certain reorganizations could result in a management team that does not function as well as an enterprises prior management and may have a negative effect on such enterprise in addition the privatization of an enterprise by its government may occur over a number of years with the government continuing to hold a controlling position in the enterprise even after the initial equity offering for the enterprise prior to privatization most of the state enterprises in which a fund may invest enjoy the protection of and receive preferential treatment from the respective sovereigns that own or control them after making an initial equity offering these enterprises may no longer have such protection or receive such preferential treatment and may become subject to market competition from which they were previously protected some of these enterprises may not be able to operate effectively in a competitive market and may suffer losses or experience bankruptcy due to such competition real estate investment trusts reits reits are sometimes informally characterized as equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits investment in reits may subject a fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate such as decreases in real estate values overbuilding increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions increases in operating costs and property taxes changes in zoning laws casualty or condemnation losses possible environmental liabilities regulatory limitations on rent and fluctuations in rental income equity reits generally experience these risks directly through fee or leasehold interests whereas mortgage reits generally experience these risks indirectly through mortgage interests unless the mortgage reit forecloses on the underlying real estate changes in interest rates may also affect the value of a funds investment in reits for instance during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those reits certain reits have relatively small market capitalizations which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of their securities furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills have limited diversification and are therefore subject to risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and to maintain exemption from the registration requirements of the  act by investing in reits indirectly through a fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of a fund but also indirectly  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th similar expenses of the reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders repurchase agreements a fund may invest in repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement a fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer some repurchase commitment transactions may not provide a fund with collateral markedtomarket during the term of the commitment a repurchase agreement provides a means for a fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie a fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and the value of such securities kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to a fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to a fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case the income to a fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by a fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by a fund or as being collateral for a loan by a fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement a fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation a fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor a fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt instrument purchased for a fund the advisor seeks to minimize the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case a fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to a fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value of the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest a fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price it is possible that a fund will be unsuccessful in seeking to enforce the sellers contractual obligation to deliver additional securities reverse repurchase agreements a fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which a fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase them at an agreed upon time and price a fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements are deemed to be borrowings subject to a funds investment restrictions applicable to that activity a fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuation in the market value of fund assets and their yields small company risk the advisor believes that many small companies may have sales and earnings growth rates which exceed those of larger companies and that such growth rates may in turn be reflected in more rapid share price appreciation over time however investing in smaller company stocks involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger more established companies for example smaller companies can have limited product lines markets or financial and managerial resources smaller companies may also be dependent on one or a few key persons and may be more susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy also the securities of smaller companies may be thinly traded and therefore have to be sold at a discount from current market prices or sold in small lots over an extended period of time transaction costs in smaller company stocks may be higher than those of larger companies  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th strategic transactions and derivatives a fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of the fixedincome securities in a funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies a fund may purchase and sell exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity and fixedincome indices and other instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors collars currency forward contracts currency futures contracts currency swaps or options on currencies or currency futures and various other currency transactions collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include additional techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit subject to certain limits imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for a funds portfolio resulting from securities markets or currency exchange rate fluctuations to protect a funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of a funds portfolio to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or for any other purpose permitted by applicable law some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of a funds assets will be committed to certain strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of a fund to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of a fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation a fund can realize on its investments or cause a fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in a fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of a funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets a fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchases of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium other strategic transactions such as forward contracts and swaps are also subject to similar risks losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th instance the funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving the fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price a funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect the fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto a fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties a fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting a fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to a fund at a formula price within seven days a fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although it is not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with a fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option a fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied the fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any

by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by a fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if a fund sells a call option the premium that it receives may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in its portfolio or will increase a funds income the sale of put options can also provide income a fund may purchase and sell call options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts all calls sold by a fund must be covered ie a fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by a fund exposes the fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require a fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold a fund may purchase and sell put options on securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments whether or not it holds the above securities in its portfolio and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities a fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that a fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures a fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate currency or equity market changes and for duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to certain instruments such as index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount and a firm obligation by the buyer to deliver the specified price options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position the funds have claimed exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act therefore the funds are not subject to commodity pool operator registration and regulation under the commodity exchange act futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires a fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the mark to market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of a fund if a fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd options on securities indices and other financial indices a fund also may purchase and sell call and put options on securities indices and other financial indices and in so doing can achieve many of the same objectives it would achieve through the sale or purchase of options on individual securities or other instruments options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option on an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making up the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities currency transactions a fund may engage in currency transactions with counterparties primarily in order to hedge or manage the risk of the value of portfolio holdings denominated in particular currencies against fluctuations in relative value currency transactions include forward currency contracts exchange listed currency futures exchange listed and otc options on currencies and currency swaps a forward currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows based on the notional difference among two or more currencies and operates similarly to an interest rate swap which is described below a fund may enter into currency transactions with counterparties which have received or the guarantors of the obligations which have received a credit rating of a or p by sp or moodys respectively or that have an equivalent rating from a nrsro or except for otc currency options are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor a funds dealings in forward currency contracts and other currency transactions such as futures options options on futures and swaps generally will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except as described below transaction hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of a fund which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of income therefrom position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency a fund generally will not enter into a transaction to hedge currency exposure to an extent greater after netting all transactions intended wholly or partially to offset other transactions than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the transaction of the securities held in its portfolio that are denominated or generally quoted in or currently convertible into such currency other than with respect to proxy hedging or cross hedging as described below as applicable a fund may also crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which a fund has or in which a fund expects to have portfolio exposure to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of portfolio securities a fund may also engage in proxy hedging proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which a funds portfolio is exposed is difficult to hedge or to hedge against the us dollar proxy hedging entails entering into a commitment or option to sell a currency whose changes in value are generally considered to be correlated to a currency or currencies in which some or all of a funds portfolio securities are or are expected to be denominated in exchange for us dollars the amount of the commitment or option would not exceed the value of a funds securities denominated in correlated currencies currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments currency transactions can result in losses to a fund if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further there is the risk that the perceived correlation between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd that a fund is engaging in proxy hedging if a fund enters into a currency hedging transaction the fund will comply with the asset segregation requirements described below risks of currency transactions currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses to a fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs buyers and sellers of currency futures are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures is relatively new and the ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid market which may not always be available currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that countrys economy risks of strategic transactions outside the us when conducted outside the us strategic transactions may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in a funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which a fund may enter are interest rate currency index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars a fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of securities a fund anticipates purchasing at a later date or to enhance returns a fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream a fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by a fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values use of segregated and other special accounts most strategic transactions and certain other instruments such as reverse repurchase agreements dollar rolls and whenissued securities expose the fund to an obligation to another party the fund will comply with sec guidelines regarding cover for these strategic transactions and instruments and will if the guidelines so require segregate on its books cash or liquid assets in the prescribed amount as determined daily the fund may also enter into offsetting transactions or own positions covering its obligations although this sai describes certain permitted methods of segregating assets or otherwise covering such transactions for these purposes such descriptions are not intended to be exhaustive the fund may cover such transactions using other methods currently or in the future permitted under the  act the rules and regulations thereunder or orders issued by the sec thereunder for these purposes interpretations and guidance provided by the sec staff may be taken into account when deemed appropriate by the fund to the extent that a fund covers its commitment under strategic transactions and such other instruments including by segregation of liquid assets entering into offsetting transactions or owning positions covering its obligations such strategic transactions and instruments will not be considered a senior security by the fund and therefore will not be subject to the  asset coverage requirement otherwise applicable to borrowings by the fund  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th assets used as cover cannot be sold while the position in the corresponding strategic transaction or other such instrument is open unless they are replaced with other appropriate assets as a result the commitment of a large portion of the funds assets to cover in accounts could impede portfolio management or the funds ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations combined transactions a fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single strategic transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the advisor it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisors judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective supranational entities supranational entities are international organizations designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development and international banking institutions and related government agencies examples include the international bank for reconstruction and development the world bank the european coal and steel community the asian development bank and the interamerican development bank obligations of supranational entities are backed by the guarantee of one or more foreign governmental parties which sponsor the entity trust preferred securities a fund may invest in trust preferred securities which are hybrid instruments issued by a special purpose trust the special trust the entire equity interest of which is owned by a single issuer the proceeds of the issuance to a fund of trust preferred securities are typically used to purchase a junior subordinated debenture and distributions from the special trust are funded by the payments of principal and interest on the subordinated debenture if payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures held by the special trust are deferred by the debenture issuer the debentures would be treated as original issue discount oid obligations for the remainder of their term as a result holders of trust preferred securities such as a fund would be required to accrue daily for federal income tax purposes their share of the stated interest and the de minimis oid on the debentures regardless of whether a fund receives any cash distributions from the special trust and the value of trust preferred securities would likely be negatively affected interest payments on the underlying junior subordinated debentures typically may only be deferred if dividends are suspended on both common and preferred stock of the issuer the underlying junior subordinated debentures generally rank slightly higher in terms of payment priority than both common and preferred securities of the issuer but rank below other subordinated debentures and debt securities trust preferred securities may be subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances the market values of trust preferred securities may be more volatile than those of conventional debt securities trust preferred securities may be issued in reliance on rule a under the  act and unless and until registered are restricted securities there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of trust preferred securities and the ability of holders of trust preferred securities such as a fund to sell their holdings us government securities there are two broad categories of us governmentrelated debt instruments a direct obligations of the us treasury and b securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies examples of direct obligations of the us treasury are treasury bills notes bonds and other debt securities issued by the us treasury these instruments are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states they differ primarily in interest rates the length of maturities and the dates of issuance treasury bills have original maturities of one year or less treasury notes have original maturities of one to ten years and treasury bonds generally have original maturities of greater than ten years some agency securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states such as maritime administration title xi ship financing bonds and agency for international development housing guarantee program bonds and others are backed only by the rights of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury such as federal home loan bank  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th bonds and federal national mortgage association bonds while still others such as the securities of the federal farm credit bank are supported only by the credit of the issuer with respect to securities supported only by the credit of the issuing agency or by an additional line of credit with the us treasury there is no guarantee that the us government will provide support to such agencies and such securities may involve risk of loss of principal and interest us government securities may include zero coupon securities that have been stripped by the us government of their unmatured interest coupons and collateralized obligations issued or guaranteed by a us government agency or instrumentality interest rates on us government obligations may be fixed or variable interest rates on variable rate obligations are adjusted at regular intervals at least annually according to a formula reflecting then current specified standard rates such as day us treasury bill rates these adjustments generally tend to reduce fluctuations in the market value of the securities the government guarantee of the us government securities in a funds portfolio does not guarantee the net asset value of the shares of a fund there are market risks inherent in all investments in securities and the value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate over time normally the value of investments in us government securities varies inversely with changes in interest rates for example as interest rates rise the value of investments in us government securities will tend to decline and as interest rates fall the value of a funds investments will tend to increase in addition the potential for appreciation in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited or negated by increased principal prepayments with respect to certain mortgagebacked securities such as gnma certificates prepayments of high interest rate mortgagebacked securities during times of declining interest rates will tend to lower the return of a fund and may even result in losses to a fund if some securities were acquired at a premium moreover during periods of rising interest rates prepayments of mortgagebacked securities may decline resulting in the extension of a funds average portfolio maturity as a result a funds portfolio may experience greater volatility during periods of rising interest rates than under normal market conditions warrants the holder of a warrant has the right until the warrant expires to purchase a given number of shares of a particular issuer at a specified price such investments can provide a greater potential for profit or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security prices of warrants do not necessarily move in tandem with the prices of the underlying securities however and are therefore considered speculative investments warrants pay no dividends and confer no rights other than a purchase option thus if a warrant held by a fund were not exercised by the date of its expiration a fund would lose the entire purchase price of the warrant whenissued securities each fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued delayed delivery or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund when the fund purchases such securities it immediately assumes the risks of ownership including the risk of price fluctuation failure to deliver a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment to the extent that assets of the fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities the fund would earn no income while such securities may be sold prior to the settlement date the fund intends to purchase them with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on this basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the securities may be more or less than the purchase price zero coupon securities a fund may invest in zero coupon securities which pay no cash income and are sold at substantial discounts from their value at maturity when held to maturity their entire income which consists of accretion of discount comes from the difference between the issue price and their value at maturity zero coupon securities are subject to greater market value fluctuations from changing interest rates than debt obligations of comparable maturities which make current distributions of interest cash zero coupon securities

transactions the advisor is generally responsible for placing the orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities including the allocation of brokerage with respect to those funds for which a subinvestment advisor manages the funds investments references in this section to the advisor should be read to mean the subadvisor except as noted below the policy of the advisor in placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities for the funds is to seek best execution taking into account such factors among others as price commission where applicable the brokerdealers ability to ensure that securities will be delivered on settlement date the willingness of the brokerdealer to commit its capital and purchase a thinly traded security for its own inventory whether the brokerdealer specializes in block orders or large program trades the brokerdealers knowledge of the market and the security the brokerdealers ability to maintain confidentiality the brokerdealers ability to provide access to new issues the brokerdealers ability to provide support when placing a difficult trade the financial condition of the brokerdealer and whether the brokerdealer has the infrastructure and operational capabilities to execute and settle the trade the advisor seeks to evaluate the overall reasonableness of brokerage commissions with commissions charged on comparable transactions and compares the brokerage commissions if any paid by the funds to reported commissions paid by others the advisor routinely reviews commission rates execution and settlement services performed and makes internal and external comparisons commission rates on transactions in equity securities on us securities exchanges are subject to negotiation commission rates on transactions in equity securities on foreign securities exchanges are generally fixed purchases and sales of fixedincome securities and certain overthecounter securities are effected on a net basis without the payment of brokerage commissions transactions in fixed income and certain overthecounter securities are generally placed by the advisor with the principal market makers for these securities unless the advisor reasonably believes more favorable results are available elsewhere transactions with dealers serving as market makers reflect the spread between the bid and asked prices purchases of underwritten issues will include an underwriting fee paid to the underwriter money market instruments are normally purchased in principal transactions directly from the issuer or from an underwriter or market maker it is likely that the brokerdealers selected based on the considerations described in this section will include firms that also sell shares of the funds to their customers however the advisor does not consider sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds and accordingly has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the advisor is permitted by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  act when placing portfolio transactions for a fund to cause the fund to pay brokerage commissions in excess of that which another brokerdealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain research and brokerage services if the advisor determines that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the overall services provided the advisor may from time to time in reliance on section e of the  act execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers that provide research and brokerage services to the advisor consistent with the advisors policy regarding best execution where more than one broker is believed to be capable of providing best execution for a particular trade the advisor may take into consideration the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the brokerdealer to execute the trade although certain research and brokerage services from brokerdealers may be useful to a fund and to the advisor it is the opinion of the advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since the information must still be analyzed weighed and reviewed by the advisors staff to the extent that research and brokerage services of value are received by the advisor the advisor may avoid expenses that it might otherwise incur research and brokerage services received from a brokerdealer may be useful to the advisor and its affiliates in providing investment management services to all or some of its clients which includes a fund services received from brokerdealers that executed securities transactions for a portfolio will not necessarily be used by the advisor specifically to service such fund research and brokerage services provided by brokerdealers may include but are not limited to information on the economy industries groups of securities individual companies statistical information accounting and tax law interpretations political developments legal developments affecting portfolio securities technical market action pricing and appraisal services credit analysis risk measurement analysis performance analysis and measurement and analysis of corporate responsibility issues research and brokerage services are typically received in the form of written or electronic reports access to specialized financial publications telephone contacts and personal meetings with security analysts but may also be provided in the form of access to various computer software and meetings arranged with corporate and industry representatives the advisor may also select brokerdealers and obtain from them research and brokerage services that are used in connection with executing trades provided that such services are consistent with interpretations under section e of the  act typically these services take the form of computer software andor electronic communication services used by the advisor to facilitate trading activity with those brokerdealers research and brokerage services may include products obtained from third parties if the advisor determines that such product or service constitutes brokerage and research as defined in section e and interpretations thereunder currently it is the advisors policy that subadvisors may not execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the funds to obtain third party research and brokerage services the advisor may in the future change this policy regardless certain subadvisors may as matter of internal policy limit or preclude third party research and brokerage services the advisor may use brokerage commissions to obtain certain brokerage products or services that have a mixed use ie it also serves a function that does not relate to the investment decisionmaking process in those circumstances the advisor will make a good faith judgment to evaluate the various benefits and uses to which it intends to put the mixed use product or service and will pay for that portion of the mixed use product or service that it reasonably believes does not constitute research and brokerage services with its own resources dima will monitor regulatory developments and market practice in the use of client commissions to obtain research and brokerage services and may adjust its portfolio transactions policies in response thereto investment decisions for each fund and for other investment accounts managed by the advisor are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions however the same investment decision may be made for two or more of such accounts in such cases simultaneous transactions are inevitable to the extent permitted by law the advisor may aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased for a fund with those to be sold or purchased for other accounts in executing transactions purchases or sales are then averaged as to price and commission and allocated as to amount in a manner deemed equitable to

making either of these elections therefore may require such fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the funds total return dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income taxation of certain investments a funds

year from the date of issuance and all zerocoupon debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance that are acquired by a fund will be treated as debt obligations that are issued originally at a discount generally the amount of the original issue discount oid is treated as interest income and is included in taxable income and required to be

interest original issue discount or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income these and other related issues will be addressed by a fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax if a fund engages in hedging transactions including hedging transactions in options futures contracts and straddles or other similar transactions it will be subject to special tax rules including constructive sale marktomarket straddle wash sale and short sale rules the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the fund defer losses to the fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of the funds securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains or convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders such fund will endeavor to make any available elections pertaining to such transactions in a manner believed to be in the best interests of the fund certain of a funds hedging activities may produce a difference between its book income and the sum of its net taxexempt and taxable income if a funds book income exceeds its taxexempt income the distribution if any of such excess will be treated as i a dividend to the extent

guidelines each fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to its investment advisor subject to its respective boards general oversight each fund has delegated proxy voting to the advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted consistent with the funds best economic interests the advisor has adopted its own proxy voting policies and procedures policies and proxy voting guidelines guidelines for this purpose the policies address among other things conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the funds and the interests of the advisor and its affiliates including the funds principal underwriter the guidelines set forth the advisors general position on various proposals such as o shareholder rights  the advisor generally votes against proposals that restrict shareholder rights o corporate governance  the advisor generally votes for confidential and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements for charter and bylaw amendments the advisor generally votes for proposals to restrict a chief executive officer from serving on more than three outside boards of directors the advisor generally votes against proposals that require a company to appoint a chairman who is an independent director o antitakeover matters  the advisor generally votes for proposals that require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that request boards to redeem poison pills and votes against the adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder ratification the advisor generally votes for fair price proposals o compensation matters  the advisor generally votes for executive cash compensation proposals unless they are unreasonably excessive the advisor generally votes against stock option plans that do not meet the advisors criteria o routine matters  the advisor generally votes for the ratification of auditors procedural matters related to the annual meeting and changes in company name and against bundled proposals and adjournment the general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies the advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment companies in accordance with the recommendations of an independent third party except for proxies solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment advisor or principal underwriter affiliated investment companies the advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies in the same proportion as the vote of the investment companys other shareholders sometimes called mirror or echo voting master fund proxies solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements of the investment company act of  although the guidelines set forth the advisors general voting positions on various proposals the advisor may consistent with the funds best interests determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions the guidelines on a particular issue may or may not reflect the view of individual members of the board or of a majority of the board in addition the guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices of the public companies within the deutsche bank organization or of the investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment advisor or sponsor the advisor may consider the views of a portfolio companys management in deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the guidelines but managements views are not determinative  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th as mentioned above the policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves conflicts of interest to resolve conflicts the advisor under normal circumstances votes proxies in accordance with its guidelines if the advisor departs from the guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal a proxy voting committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy before voting any such proxy however the advisors conflicts review committee will conduct an investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in connection with the particular proxy proposal if the conflicts review committee determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest or certain individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating in a particular proxy vote it will inform the proxy voting committee if notified that the advisor has a material conflict or fewer than three voting members are eligible to participate in the proxy vote typically the advisor will engage an independent third party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy voting recommendations of an independent third party under certain circumstances the advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the advisor may find that the expected economic costs from voting outweigh the benefits associated with voting for example the advisor may not vote proxies on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs the advisor generally does not vote proxies

such a structure permits the pooling of assets of two or more feeder funds preserving separate identities or distribution channels at the feeder fund level based on the premise that certain of the expenses of operating an investment portfolio are relatively fixed a larger investment portfolio may eventually achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average net assets an existing investment

and techniques general the fund is an openend management investment company which continuously offers and redeems shares at net asset value less applicable sales charges or fees the fund is a company of the type commonly known as a mutual fund the fund offers four classes of shares class a class c class s and institutional class class s shares of the fund are offered through a separate statement of additional information investment objective and policies the fund seeks longterm capital appreciation with current income as a secondary objective under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its assets determined at the time of purchase in the stocks and other securities with equity characteristics of companies in developed countries outside the united states almost all the companies in which the fund invests are based in the developed foreign countries that make up the morgan stanley capital international europe australia and ear east index msci eafe index the fund may also invest a portion of its assets in companies based in the emerging markets of latin america the middle east europe asia and africa if the portfolio managers believe that their return potential more than compensates for the extra risks associated with these markets while the portfolio managers have invested in emerging markets in the past under normal market conditions they do not consider this a central element of the funds strategy typically the fund would not hold more than  of its net assets in emerging markets in implementing this overall strategy the fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate the fund may also invest up to  of its assets in cash equivalents us investmentgrade fixedincome securities and us stocks and other equities the fund invests for the long term the portfolio managers employ a value strategy and invest in companies that they believe are undervalued these are typically companies that have been historically sound but are temporarily out of favor the fund intends to invest primarily in companies whose market capitalizations fall within the normal range of the msci eafe index the portfolio managers track several thousand companies to arrive at between  to  stocks the fund normally holds the managers use a variety of quantitative screens to compare a companys stock price to its book value cash flow and dividend yield and analyze individual companies to identify those that are financially sound and appear to have strong potential for longterm growth after narrowing the investment universe through the use of valuation screens the portfolio managers use of fundamental research tools lies at the heart of the investment process the portfolio managers process brings an added dimension to this fundamental research by drawing on the insight of experts from a range of financial disciplines  regional stock market specialists global industry specialists economists and quantitative analysts they challenge refine and amplify each others ideas their close collaboration is a critical element of the portfolio managers investment process the fund may invest in various instruments commonly known as derivatives to increase or decrease its exposure to an asset class securities market index or currency the fund will primarily use futures options options on futures forward currency transactions and swaps the fund may also invest in derivatives to gain exposure to the market while at the same time maintaining a high degree of liquidity in order to meet shareholder redemptions or other needs use of some derivatives may have the effect of leveraging the funds exposure to a particular asset class or other investment which heightens risk but may also allow for enhanced returns in implementing this strategy the fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate investment techniques descriptions in this statement of additional information of a particular investment practice or technique in which the fund may engage are meant to describe the spectrum of investments that the advisor or the subadvisor  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd hereinafter the advisor in its discretion might but is not required to use in managing the funds portfolio assets the advisor may in its discretion at any time employ such a practice technique or instrument for one or more funds but not for all funds advised by it furthermore it is possible that certain types of financial instruments or investment techniques described herein may not be available permissible economically feasible or effective for their intended purposes in all markets certain practices techniques or instruments may not be principal activities of the fund but to the extent employed could from time to time have a material impact on the funds performance the fund may engage in certain practices not described herein borrowing as a matter of fundamental policy the fund may not borrow money except as permitted under the  act and as interpreted or modified by regulatory authority having jurisdiction from time to time while the fund does not currently intend to borrow for investment leveraging purposes if such a strategy were implemented in the future it would increase the funds volatility and the risk of loss in a declining market borrowing by the fund will involve special risk considerations the funds assets may change in value during the time a borrowing is outstanding thus increasing exposure to capital risk common stocks common stock is issued by companies to raise cash for business purposes and represents a proportionate interest in the issuing companies therefore the fund participates in the success or failure of any company in which it holds stock the market values of common stock can fluctuate significantly reflecting the business performance of the issuing company investor perception and general economic and financial market movements despite the risk of price volatility however common stocks have historically offered a greater potential for longterm gain on investment compared to other classes of financial assets such as bonds or cash equivalents although there can be no assurance that this will be true in the future convertible securities the fund may invest in convertible securities that is bonds notes debentures preferred stocks and other securities which are convertible into common stock investments in convertible securities can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation andor income through interest and dividend payments by virtue of their conversion or exchange features the convertible securities in which the fund may invest are either fixed income or zero coupon debt securities which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying shares of common stock the exchange ratio for any particular convertible security may be adjusted from time to time due to stock splits dividends spinoffs other corporate distributions or scheduled changes in the exchange ratio convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stocks until converted have general characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities although to a lesser extent than with debt securities generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely tends to increase as interest rates decline in addition because of the conversion or exchange feature the market value of convertible securities typically changes as the market value of the underlying common stocks changes and therefore also tends to follow movements in the general market for equity securities a unique feature of convertible securities is that as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the prices of the convertible securities tend to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock although typically not as much as the underlying common stock while no securities investments are without risk investments in convertible securities generally entail less risk than investments in common stock of the same issuer as debt securities convertible securities are investments which provide for a stream of income or in the case of zero coupon securities accretion of income with generally higher yields than common stocks convertible securities generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality because of their conversion or exchange features of course like all debt securities there can be no assurance of income or principal payments because the issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations convertible securities generally are subordinated to other similar but nonconvertible securities of the same issuer although convertible bonds as corporate debt obligations enjoy seniority in right of payment to all equity securities  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th and convertible preferred stock is senior to common stock of the same issuer however because of the subordination feature convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock typically have lower ratings than similar nonconvertible securities convertible securities may be issued as fixed income obligations that pay current income or as zero coupon notes and bonds including liquid yield option notes lyonstm debt securities the fund may invest in debt securities including bonds of private issuers portfolio debt investments will be selected on the basis of among other things credit quality and the fundamental outlooks for currency economic and interest rate trends taking into account the ability to hedge a degree of currency or local bond price risk the fund may purchase investmentgrade bonds rated aaa aa a or baa by moodys or aaa aa a or bbb by sp or if unrated judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor the principal risks involved with investments in bonds include interest rate risk credit risk and prepayment risk interest rate risk refers to the likely decline in the value of bonds as interest rates rise generally longerterm securities are more susceptible to changes in value as a result of interestrate changes than are shorterterm securities credit risk refers to the risk that an issuer of a bond may default with respect to the payment of principal and interest the lower a bond is rated the more it is considered to be a speculative or risky investment prepayment risk is commonly associated with pooled debt securities such as mortgagebacked securities and asset backed securities but may affect other debt securities as well when the underlying debt obligations are prepaid ahead of schedule the return on the security will be lower than expected prepayment rates usually increase when interest rates are falling depositary receipts the fund may invest in sponsored or unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs international depositary receipts idrs and other types of depositary receipts which together with adrs edrs gdrs and idrs are hereinafter referred to as depositary receipts depositary receipts provide indirect investment in securities of foreign issuers prices of unsponsored depositary receipts may be more volatile than if they were sponsored by the issuer of the underlying securities depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which they may be converted in addition the issuers of the stock of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the united states and therefore there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts adrs are depositary receipts which are bought and sold in the united states and are typically issued by a us bank or trust company and which evidence ownership of underlying securities by a foreign corporation gdrs idrs and other types of depositary receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they may also be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation generally

states for purposes of the funds investment policies the funds investments in adrs gdrs and other types of depositary receipts will be deemed to be investments in the underlying securities depositary receipts including those denominated in us dollars will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk however by investing in us dollardenominated adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock the fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period in general there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs however certain depositary receipts may not be listed on an exchange and therefore may be illiquid securities eurodollar instruments the fund may make investments in eurodollar instruments for hedging purposes or to enhance potential gain eurodollar instruments are us dollardenominated futures contracts or options thereon which are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor although foreign currencydenominated instruments are available from time to time eurodollar futures contracts enable purchasers to obtain a fixed rate for the lending of funds and sellers to obtain a fixed rate for borrowings the fund might use eurodollar futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in libor to which many interest rate swaps and fixed income instruments are linked eurodollar obligations eurodollar bank obligations are us dollardenominated certificates of deposit and time deposits issued outside the us capital markets by foreign branches of us banks and us branches of foreign banks  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th eurodollar obligations are subject to the same risks that pertain to domestic issues notably credit risk market risk and liquidity risk additionally eurodollar obligations are subject to certain sovereign risks foreign currencies because investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries and because the fund may hold foreign currencies and forward contracts futures contracts options on foreign currencies and foreign currency futures contracts and other currencyrelated instruments the value of the assets of the fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs and experience conversion difficulties and uncertainties in connection with conversions between various currencies fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the earning power and asset value of the foreign entity issuing the security the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies is responsible for part of the funds investment performance if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen for example the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall many foreign currencies have experienced significant devaluation relative to the dollar although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer the fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into options or forward or futures contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies foreign fixed income securities since most foreign fixed income securities are not rated a fund will invest in foreign fixed income securities based on the advisors analysis without relying on published ratings since such investments will be based upon the advisors analysis rather than upon published ratings achievement of a funds goals may depend more upon the abilities of the advisor than would otherwise be the case the value of the foreign fixed income securities held by a fund and thus the net asset value of a funds shares generally will fluctuate with a changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the issuers of those securities b movements in interest rates and c changes in the relative values of the currencies in which a funds investments in fixed income securities are denominated with respect to the us dollar the extent of the fluctuation will depend on various factors such as the average maturity of a funds investments in foreign fixed income securities and the extent to which a fund hedges its interest rate credit and currency exchange rate risks a longer average maturity generally is associated with a higher level of volatility in the market value of such securities in response to changes in market conditions investments in sovereign debt including brady bonds brady bonds are debt securities issued under a plan implemented to allow debtor nations to restructure their outstanding commercial bank indebtedness involve special risks foreign governmental issuers of debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or pay interest when due in the event of default there may be limited or no legal recourse in that generally remedies for defaults must be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party political conditions especially a sovereign entitys willingness to meet the terms of its fixed income securities are of considerable significance also there can be no assurance that the holders of commercial bank loans to the same sovereign entity may not contest payments to the holders of sovereign debt in the event of default under commercial bank loan agreements in addition there is no bankruptcy proceeding with respect to sovereign debt on which a sovereign has defaulted and a fund may be unable to collect all or any part of its investment in a particular issue foreign investment in certain sovereign debt is restricted or controlled to varying degrees including requiring governmental approval for the repatriation of income capital or proceed of sales by foreign investors these restrictions or controls may at times limit or preclude foreign investment in certain sovereign debt or increase the costs and expenses of a fund  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th sovereign debt of emerging market governmental issuers is to be considered speculative emerging market governmental issuers are among the largest debtors to commercial banks foreign governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions certain emerging market governmental issuers have not been able to make payments of interest on or principal of debt obligations as those payments have come due there is a history of defaults with respect to commercial bank loans by public and private entities issuing sovereign debt all or a portion of the interest payments andor principal repayment with respect to sovereign debt may be uncollateralized obligations arising from past restructuring agreements may affect the economic performance and political and social stability of those issuers the ability of emerging market country governmental issuers to make timely payments on their obligations is likely to be influenced strongly by the issuers balance of payments including export performance and its access to international credits and investments an emerging market whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities could be vulnerable to a decline in the international prices of one or more of those commodities increased protectionism on the part of an emerging markets trading partners could also adversely affect the countrys exports and diminish its trade account surplus if any to the extent that emerging markets receive payment for its exports in currencies other than dollars or nonemerging market currencies its ability to make debt payments denominated in dollars or nonemerging market currencies could be affected another factor bearing on the ability of emerging market countries to repay debt obligations is the level of international reserves of the country fluctuations in the level of these reserves affect the amount of foreign exchange readily available for external debt payments and thus could have a bearing on the capacity of emerging market countries to make payments on these debt obligations to the extent that an emerging market country cannot generate a trade surplus it must depend on continuing loans from foreign governments multilateral organizations or private commercial banks aid payments from foreign governments and inflows of foreign investment the access of emerging markets to these forms of external funding may not be certain and a withdrawal of external funding could adversely affect the capacity of emerging market country governmental issuers to make payments on their obligations in addition the cost of servicing emerging market debt obligations can be affected by a change in international interest rates since the majority of these obligations carry interest rates that are adjusted periodically based upon international rates foreign investment foreign securities are normally denominated and traded in foreign currencies as a result the value of the funds foreign investments and the value of its shares may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar there may be less information publicly available about a foreign issuer than about a us issuer and foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the us the securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers foreign brokerage commissions and other fees are also generally higher than in the us foreign settlement procedures and trade regulations may involve certain risks such as delay in payment or delivery of securities or in the recovery of the funds assets held abroad and expenses not present in the settlement of investments in us markets payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition foreign securities may be subject to the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets imposition of currency exchange controls or restrictions on the repatriation of foreign currency confiscatory taxation political or financial instability and diplomatic developments which could affect the value of the funds investments in certain foreign countries governments of many countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector through the ownership or control of many companies including some of the largest in these countries as a result government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions which may adversely affect prices of certain portfolio securities there is also generally less government supervision and regulation of stock exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the us dividends or interest on or proceeds from the sale of foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes and special us tax considerations may apply moreover foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th legal remedies available to investors in certain foreign countries may be more limited than those available with respect to investments in the us or in other foreign countries the laws of some foreign countries may limit the funds ability to invest in securities of certain issuers organized under the laws of those foreign countries of particular importance many foreign countries are heavily dependent upon exports particularly to developed countries and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the us and other countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by economic conditions in the us and other trading partners which can lower the demand for goods produced in those countries the risks described above including the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets typically are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets for example political and economic structures in these countries may be in their infancy and developing rapidly and such countries may lack the social political and economic stability characteristic of more developed countries including amplified risk of war and terrorism certain of these countries have in the past failed to recognize private property rights and have at times nationalized and expropriated the assets of private companies investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative the currencies of certain emerging market countries have experienced devaluations relative to the us dollar and future devaluations may adversely affect the value of assets denominated in such currencies in addition currency hedging techniques may be unavailable in certain emerging market countries many emerging market countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation or deflation for many years and future inflation may adversely affect the economies and securities markets of such countries in addition unanticipated political or social developments may affect the value of investments in emerging markets and the availability of additional investments in these markets any change in the leadership or politics of emerging market countries or the countries that exercise a significant influence over those countries may halt the expansion of or reverse the liberalization of foreign investment policies now occurring and adversely affect existing investment opportunities the small size limited trading volume and relative inexperience of the securities markets in these countries may make investments in securities traded in emerging markets illiquid and more volatile than investments in securities traded in more developed countries for example limited market size may cause prices to be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in addition the fund may be required to establish special custodial or other arrangements before making investments in securities traded in emerging markets there may be little financial or accounting information available with respect to issuers of emerging market securities and it may be difficult as a result to assess the value of prospects of an investment in such securities the risk also exists that an emergency situation may arise in one or more emerging markets as a result of which trading of securities may cease or may be substantially curtailed and prices for the funds securities in such markets may not be readily available the fund may suspend redemption of its shares for any period during which an emergency exists as determined by the sec accordingly if a fund believes that appropriate circumstances exist it may apply to the sec for a determination that an emergency is present during the period commencing from a funds identification of such condition until the date of the sec action the funds securities in the affected markets will be valued at fair value determined in good faith by or under the direction of the funds board certain of the foregoing risks may also apply to some extent to securities of us issuers that are denominated in foreign currencies or that are traded in foreign markets or securities of us issuers having significant foreign operations high yieldhigh risk bonds the fund may also purchase debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor these securities usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk to principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the higher rating categories the lower the ratings of such debt securities the more their risks render them like equity securities securities rated d may be in default with respect to payment of principal or interest  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th issuers of such high yielding securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing therefore the risk associated with acquiring the securities of such issuers generally is greater than is the case with higher rated securities for example during an economic downturn or a sustained period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issuers of high yield securities may experience financial stress during such periods such issuers may not have sufficient revenues to meet their interest payment obligations the issuers ability to service its debt obligations may also be adversely affected by specific corporate developments or the issuers inability to meet specific projected business forecasts or the unavailability of additional financing the risk of loss from default by the issuer is significantly greater for the holders of high yield securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates the fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield high risk securities because they may have a thin trading market because not all dealers maintain markets in all high yield securities the fund anticipates that such securities could be sold only to a limited number of dealers or institutional investors the lack of a liquid secondary market may have an adverse effect on the market price and the funds ability to dispose of particular issues and may also make it more difficult for a fund to obtain accurate market quotations for purposes of valuing the funds assets market quotations generally are available on many high yield issues only from a limited number of dealers and may not necessarily represent firm bids of such dealers or prices for actual sales adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is generally the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of the funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of the fund to retain or dispose of such security illiquid securities and restricted securities the fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended the  act issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid the funds board has approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirement that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities the fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses the fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the  act when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event the fund may be liable  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading the fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them the fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between the funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which the fund is permitted or able to sell such security the fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell impact of large redemptions and purchases of fund shares from time to time shareholders of the fund which may include affiliated andor nonaffiliated registered investment companies that invest in the fund may make relatively large redemptions or purchases of fund shares these transactions may cause the fund to have to sell securities or invest additional cash as the case may be while it is impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time there could be adverse effects on the funds performance to the extent that the fund may be required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise do so these transactions could also accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales of securities resulted in capital gains and could also increase transaction costs which may impact the funds expense ratio ipo risk securities issued through an initial public offering ipo can experience an immediate drop in value if the demand for the securities does not continue to support the offering price information about the issuers of ipo securities is also difficult to acquire since they are new to the market and may not have lengthy operating histories the fund may engage in shortterm trading in connection with its ipo investments which could produce higher trading costs and adverse tax consequences the number of securities issued in an ipo is limited so it is likely that ipo securities will represent a smaller component of the funds portfolio as the funds assets increase and thus have a more limited effect on the funds performance interfund borrowing and lending program the fund has received exemptive relief from the sec which permits the fund to participate in an interfund lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend only overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent the fund is actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund lending program the fund will comply with their respective nonfundamental policies on borrowing investment company securities the fund may acquire securities of other investment companies to the extent consistent with its investment objective and subject to the limitations of the  act the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management

and the aggregate amount of such loans are not inconsistent with the  act or the rules and regulations or interpretations of the sec thereunder which currently require that a the borrower pledge and maintain with the fund collateral consisting of liquid unencumbered assets having a value at all times not less than  of the value of the securities loaned b the borrower add to such collateral whenever the price of the securities loaned rises ie the borrower marks to the market on a daily basis c the loan be made subject to termination by the fund at any time and d the fund receives reasonable interest on the loan which may include the fund investing any cash collateral in interest bearing shortterm investments and distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in their market value there may be risks of delay in recovery of the securities or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by the funds delegate after a commercially reasonable review of relevant facts and circumstances including the creditworthiness of the borrower at the present time the staff of the sec does not object if an investment company pays reasonable negotiated fees in connection with loaned securities so long as such fees are set forth in a written contract and approved by the

company risk while historically microcapitalization company stocks have outperformed the stocks of large companies the former have customarily involved more investment risk as well there can be no assurance that this will continue to be true in the future microcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies the prices of microcapitalization company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because microcapitalization companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for the fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices some of the companies in which the fund may invest may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the securities of microcapitalization companies are often traded overthecounter and may not be traded in the volumes typical on a national securities exchange consequently in order to sell this type of holding the fund may need to discount the securities from recent prices or dispose of the securities over a long period of time participation interests the fund may purchase from financial institutions participation interests in securities in which the fund may invest a participation interest gives the fund an undivided interest in the security in the proportion that the funds participation interest bears to the principal amount of the security these instruments may have fixed floating or variable interest rates with remaining maturities of  days or less if the participation interest is unrated or has been given a rating below that which is permissible for purchase by the fund the participation interest will be backed by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of a bank or the payment obligation otherwise will be collateralized by us government securities or in the case of unrated participation interest determined by the advisor to be of comparable quality to those instruments in which the fund may invest for certain participation interests the fund will have the right to demand payment on not more than seven days notice for all or

currently undergoing privatization the governments of certain foreign countries have to varying degrees embarked on privatization programs contemplating the sale of all or part of their interests in state enterprises the funds investments in the securities of privatized enterprises may include privately negotiated investments in a government or stateowned or controlled company or enterprise that has not yet conducted an initial equity offering investments in the initial offering of equity securities of a state enterprise or former state enterprise and investments in the securities of a state enterprise following its initial equity offering in certain jurisdictions the ability of foreign entities such as the fund to participate in privatizations may be limited by local law or the price or terms on which the fund may be able to participate may be less advantageous than for local investors moreover there can be no assurance that governments that have embarked on privatization programs will continue to divest their ownership of state enterprises that proposed privatizations will be successful or that governments will not renationalize enterprises that have been privatized in the case of the enterprises in which the fund may invest large blocks of the stock of those enterprises may be held by a small group of stockholders even after the initial equity offerings by those enterprises the sale of some portion or all of those blocks could have an adverse effect on the price of the stock of any such enterprise prior to making an initial equity offering most state enterprises or former state enterprises go through an internal reorganization or management such reorganizations are made in an attempt to better enable these enterprises to compete in the private sector however certain reorganizations could result in a management team that does not function as well as an enterprises prior management and may have a negative effect on such enterprise in addition the privatization of an enterprise by its government may occur over a number of years with the government continuing to hold a controlling position in the enterprise even after the initial equity offering for the enterprise prior to privatization most of the state enterprises in which the fund may invest enjoy the protection of and receive preferential treatment from the respective sovereigns that own or control them after making an initial equity offering these enterprises may no longer have such protection or receive such preferential treatment and may become subject to market competition from which they were previously protected some of these enterprises may not be able to operate effectively in a competitive market and may suffer losses or experience bankruptcy due to such competition real estate investment trusts reits reits are sometimes informally categorized into equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits investment in reits may subject the fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate such as decreases in real estate values overbuilding increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions increases in operating costs and property taxes changes in zoning laws casualty or condemnation losses possible environmental liabilities regulatory limitations on rent and fluctuations in rental income equity reits generally experience these risks directly through fee or leasehold interests whereas mortgage reits generally experience these risks indirectly through mortgage interests unless the mortgage reit forecloses on the underlying real estate changes in interest rates may also affect the value of the funds investment in reits for instance during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those reits certain reits have relatively small market capitalizations which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of their securities furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills have limited diversification and are therefore subject to risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the code and to maintain exemption from the registration requirements of the  act by investing in reits indirectly through the fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the fund but also indirectly expenses of the reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd repurchase agreements the fund may enter in repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement the fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer a repurchase agreement provides a means for the fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie the fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and as described in more detail below and the value of such securities kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to the fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to the fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case the income to the fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by the fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by the fund or as being collateral for a loan by the fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement the fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and the fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation the fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor the fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt instrument purchased for the fund the advisor seeks to minimize the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case the fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to the fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value including interest of the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest the fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value including interest of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price repurchase commitments the fund may enter into repurchase commitments with any party deemed creditworthy by the advisor including foreign banks and brokerdealers if the transaction is entered into for investment purposes and the counterpartys creditworthiness is at least equal to that of issuers of securities which the fund may purchase such transactions may not provide the fund with collateral markedtomarket during the term of the commitment reverse repurchase agreements the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which the fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase them at an agreed time and price the fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and its yield small company risk the advisor believes that many small companies may have sales and earnings growth rates which exceed those of larger companies and that such growth rates may in turn be reflected in more rapid share price appreciation over time however investing in smaller company stocks involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger more established companies for example smaller companies can have limited product lines markets or financial and managerial resources smaller companies may also be dependent on one or a few key persons and may be more susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy also the securities of smaller companies may be thinly traded and therefore have to be sold at a discount from current market prices or sold in small lots over an extended period of time transaction costs in smaller company stocks may be higher than those of larger companies sovereign debt investment in sovereign debt can involve a high degree of risk the governmental entity that controls the repayment of sovereign debt may not be able or willing to repay the principal andor interest when due  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th in accordance with the terms of such debt a governmental entitys willingness or ability to repay principal and interest due in a timely manner may be affected by among other factors its cash flow situation the extent of its foreign reserves the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole the governmental entitys policy toward the international monetary fund and the political constraints to which a governmental entity may be subject governmental entities may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments multilateral agencies and others abroad to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt the commitment on the part of these governments agencies and others to make such disbursements may be conditioned on a governmental entitys implementation of economic reforms andor economic performance and the timely service of such debtors obligations failure to implement such reforms achieve such levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of such third parties commitments to lend funds to the governmental entity which may further impair such debtors ability or willingness to service its debts in a timely manner consequently governmental entities may default on their sovereign debt holders of sovereign debt may be requested to participate in the rescheduling of such debt and to extend further loans to governmental entities there is no bankruptcy proceeding by which sovereign debt on which governmental entities have defaulted may be collected in whole or in part strategic transactions and derivatives the fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of the fixedincome securities in the funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies the fund may purchase and sell exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity and fixedincome indices and other instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors collars currency forward contracts currency futures contracts currency swaps or options on currencies or currency futures and various other currency transactions collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include additional techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit subject to certain limits imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for the funds portfolio resulting from securities markets or currency exchange rate fluctuations to protect the funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of the funds portfolio to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or for any other purpose permitted by applicable law some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of the funds assets will be committed to certain strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of the fund to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the fund will comply with applicable regulatory requirements when implementing these strategies techniques and instruments strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of the fund and the fund will segregate assets or as provided by applicable regulations enter into certain offsetting positions to cover its obligations under options futures and swaps to limit leveraging of the fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on its investments or cause the fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in a fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th may be greater than gains in the value of the funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets the fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchases of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium other strategic transactions such as forward contracts and swaps are also subject to similar risks losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance the funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving the fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price the funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect the fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto the fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option the funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties the fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting the fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to the fund at a formula price within seven days the fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although it is not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with the fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option the fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied the fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or in the case of otc currency transactions are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by the fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of the funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to the funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if the fund sells a call option the premium that it receives may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in its portfolio or will increase the funds income the sale of put options can also provide income the fund may purchase and sell call options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts all calls sold by the fund must be covered ie the fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though the fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by the fund exposes the fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require the fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold the fund may purchase and sell put options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments whether or not it holds the above securities in its portfolio and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities the fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that the fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures the fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate currency or equity market changes and for duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to certain instruments such as index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount and a firm obligation by the buyer to deliver the specified price options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position the fund has claimed exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act therefore the fund is not subject to commodity pool operator registration and regulation under the commodity exchange act futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires the fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the marked to market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of the fund if the fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur options on securities indices and other financial indices the fund also may purchase and sell call and put options on securities indices and other financial indices and in so doing can achieve many of the same objectives it would achieve through the sale or purchase of options on individual securities or other instruments options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option on an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making up the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities currency transactions the fund may engage in currency transactions with counterparties primarily in order to hedge or manage the risk of the value of portfolio holdings denominated in particular currencies against fluctuations in relative value currency transactions include forward currency contracts exchange listed currency futures exchange listed and otc options on currencies and currency swaps a forward currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows based on the notional difference among two or more currencies and operates similarly to an interest rate swap which is described below the fund may enter into currency transactions with counterparties which have received or the guarantors of the obligations which have received a credit rating of a or p by sp or moodys respectively or that have an equivalent rating from a nrsro or except for otc currency options are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the funds dealings in forward currency contracts and other currency transactions such as futures options options on futures and swaps generally will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except as described below transaction hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of the fund which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of income therefrom position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the fund generally will not enter into a transaction to hedge currency exposure to an extent greater after netting all transactions intended wholly or partially to offset other transactions than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the transaction of the securities held in its portfolio that are denominated or generally quoted in or currently convertible into such currency other than with respect to proxy hedging or cross hedging as described below as applicable the fund may also crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which the fund has or in which the fund expects to have portfolio exposure to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of portfolio securities the fund may also engage in proxy hedging proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which the funds portfolio is exposed is difficult to hedge or to hedge against the dollar proxy hedging entails entering into a commitment or option to sell a currency whose changes in value are generally considered to be correlated to a currency or currencies in which some or all of the funds portfolio securities are or are expected to be denominated in exchange for us dollars currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments currency transactions can result in losses to the fund if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further there is the risk that the perceived correlation between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time that the fund is engaging in proxy hedging if the fund enters into a currency hedging transaction the fund will comply with the asset segregation requirements described below as applicable risks of currency transactions currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses to the fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs buyers and sellers of currency futures are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures is relatively new and the ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid market which may not always be available currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that countrys economy risks of strategic transactions outside the us when conducted outside the us strategic transactions may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in the funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which the fund may enter are interest rate currency index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars the fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique to protect against any increase in the price of securities the fund anticipates purchasing at a later date or to enhance returns the fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values use of segregated and other special accounts many strategic transactions in addition to other requirements require that the fund segregate cash or liquid assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by the fund to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid assets at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by the fund will require the fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by the fund on an index will require the fund to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by the fund requires the fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price except when the fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency which requires no segregation a currency contract which obligates the fund to buy or sell currency will generally require the fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid assets denominated in that currency equal to the funds obligations or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the amount of the funds obligation otc options entered into by the fund including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when the fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by the fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when the fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price the fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by the fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and the fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon the fund must deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition to segregating cash or liquid assets sufficient to meet its obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such liquid assets may consist of cash cash equivalents liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps the fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of its obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars require segregation of assets with a value equal to the funds net obligation if any strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies the fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and strategic transactions for example the fund could purchase a  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by the fund moreover instead of segregating cash or liquid assets if the fund held a futures or forward contract it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held other strategic transactions may also be offset in combinations if the offsetting transaction terminates at the time of or after the primary transaction no segregation is required but if it terminates prior to such time cash or liquid assets equal to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated combined transactions the fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single strategic transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the advisor it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisors judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective supranational entities supranational entities are international organizations designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development and international banking institutions and related government agencies examples include the international bank for reconstruction and development the world bank the european coal and steel community the asian development bank and the interamerican development bank obligations of supranational entities are backed by the guarantee of one or more foreign governmental parties which sponsor the entity whenissued securities the fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued delayed delivery or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund when the fund purchases such securities it immediately assumes the risks of ownership including the risk of price fluctuation failure to deliver a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment to the extent that assets of the fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities the fund would earn no income while such securities may be sold prior to the settlement date the fund intends to purchase them with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on this basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the securities may be more or less than the purchase price the fund will establish a segregated account in which it will maintain cash and liquid securities equal in value to commitments for such securities warrants the fund may invest in warrants up to  of the value of its total assets the holder of a warrant has the right until the warrant expires to purchase a given number of shares of a particular issuer at a specified price such investments can provide a greater potential for profit or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security prices of warrants do not necessarily move however in tandem with the prices of the underlying securities and are therefore considered speculative investments warrants pay no dividends and confer no rights other than a purchase option thus if a warrant held by the fund were not exercised by the date of its expiration the fund would lose the entire purchase price of the warrant zero coupon securities the fund may invest in zero coupon securities which pay no cash income and are sold at substantial discounts from their value at maturity when held to maturity their entire income which consists of accretion of discount comes from the difference between the purchase price and their value at maturity the effect of owning instruments which do not make current interest payments is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount accretion during the life of the obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest distributions at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the zero coupon bond but at the same time eliminates any opportunity to reinvest earnings at  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st higher rates for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than those of comparable securities that pay interest currently which fluctuation is greater as the period to maturity is longer zero coupon convertible securities which are convertible into common stock offer the opportunity for capital appreciation or depreciation as increases or decreases in market value of such securities closely follow the movements in the market value of the underlying common stock zero coupon convertible securities generally are expected to be less volatile than the underlying common stocks as they usually are issued with maturities of  years or less and are issued with options andor redemption features exercisable by the holder of the

manages the funds investments references in this section to the advisor should be read to mean the subadvisor except as noted below the policy of the advisor in placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities for the funds is to seek best execution taking into account such factors among others as price commission where applicable the brokerdealers ability to ensure that securities will be delivered on settlement date the willingness of the brokerdealer to commit its capital and purchase a thinly traded security for its own inventory whether the brokerdealer specializes in block orders or large program trades the brokerdealers knowledge of the market and the security the brokerdealers ability to maintain confidentiality the brokerdealers ability to provide access to new issues the brokerdealers ability to provide support when placing a difficult trade the financial condition of the brokerdealer and whether the brokerdealer has the infrastructure and operational capabilities to execute and settle the trade the advisor seeks to evaluate the overall reasonableness of brokerage commissions with commissions charged on comparable transactions and compares the brokerage commissions if any paid by the funds to reported commissions paid by others the advisor routinely reviews commission rates execution and settlement services performed and makes internal and external comparisons commission rates on transactions in equity securities on us securities exchanges are subject to negotiation commission rates on transactions in equity securities on foreign securities exchanges are generally fixed purchases and sales of fixedincome securities and certain overthecounter securities are effected on a net basis without the payment of brokerage commissions transactions in fixed income and certain overthecounter securities are generally placed by the advisor with the principal market makers for these securities unless the advisor reasonably believes more favorable results are available elsewhere transactions with dealers serving as market makers reflect the spread between the bid and asked prices purchases of underwritten issues will include an underwriting fee paid to the underwriter money market instruments are normally purchased in principal transactions directly from the issuer or from an underwriter or market maker it is likely that the brokerdealers selected based on the considerations described in this section will include firms that also sell shares of the funds to their customers however the advisor does not consider sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds and accordingly has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds the advisor is permitted by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  act when placing portfolio transactions for a fund to cause the fund to pay brokerage commissions in excess of that which another brokerdealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain research and brokerage services if the advisor determines that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the overall services provided the advisor may from time to time in reliance on section e of the  act execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers that provide research and brokerage services to the advisor consistent with the advisors policy regarding best execution where more than one broker is believed to be capable of providing best execution for a particular trade the advisor may take into consideration the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the brokerdealer to execute the trade although certain research and brokerage services from brokerdealers may be useful to a fund and to the advisor it is the opinion of the advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since the information must still be analyzed weighed and reviewed by the advisors staff to the extent that research and brokerage services of value are received by the advisor the advisor may avoid expenses that it might otherwise incur research and brokerage services received from a brokerdealer may be useful to the advisor and its affiliates in providing investment management services to all or some of its clients which includes a fund services received from brokerdealers that executed securities

advisor may also select brokerdealers and obtain from them research and brokerage services that are used in connection with executing trades provided that such services are consistent with interpretations under section e of the  act typically these services take the form of computer software andor electronic communication services used by the advisor to facilitate trading activity with those brokerdealers research and brokerage services may include products obtained from third parties if the advisor determines that such product or service constitutes brokerage and research as defined in section e and interpretations thereunder currently it is the advisors policy that subadvisors may not execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the funds to obtain third party research and brokerage services the advisor may in the future change this policy regardless certain subadvisors may as matter of internal policy limit or preclude third party research and brokerage services the advisor may use brokerage commissions to obtain certain brokerage products or services that have a mixed use ie it also serves a function that does not relate to the investment decisionmaking process in those circumstances the advisor will make a good faith judgment to evaluate the various benefits and uses to which it intends to put the mixed use product or service and will pay for that portion of the mixed use product or service that it reasonably believes does not constitute research and brokerage services with its own resources dima will monitor regulatory developments and market

in such cases simultaneous transactions are inevitable to the extent permitted by law the advisor may aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased for a fund with those to be sold or purchased for other accounts in executing transactions purchases or sales are then averaged as to price and commission and allocated as to amount in a manner deemed equitable to each account while in some cases this practice could have a detrimental effect on the price paid or received by or on the size of the position obtained or disposed of for the fund in other cases it is believed that the ability to engage in volume transactions will be beneficial to the fund dima and its affiliates and the funds management team manage other mutual funds and separate accounts some of which use short sales of

received from the disposition of shares in the company which tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders however the fund may elect to avoid the imposition of that tax for example the fund may elect to treat a pfic as a qualified electing fund a qef election in which case the fund would be required to include its share of the companys income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether it receives any distribution from the company the fund also may make an election to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in such holdings to the market as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in those pfics on the last day of the funds taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation making either of these elections therefore may require the fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the funds total return dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income tax effects of certain transactions the funds investment in zero coupon bonds and

interest original issue discount or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income these and other related issues will be addressed by the fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax if the fund engages in hedging transactions including hedging transactions in options futures contracts and straddles or other similar transactions it will be subject to special tax rules including constructive sale marktomarket straddle wash sale and short sale rules the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the fund defer losses to the fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of the funds securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains or convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders the fund will endeavor to make any available elections pertaining to such transactions in a manner believed to be in the best interests of the fund certain of the funds hedging activities including transactions if any in foreign currencies or foreign currencydenominated instruments may produce a difference between its book income and its taxable income if the funds book income exceeds its taxable income the distribution if any of such excess will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the funds remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipients basis in the shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if the funds book income is less

proxy voting responsibilities to the advisor subject to the boards general oversight the fund has delegated proxy voting to the advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted consistent with the funds best economic interests the advisor has adopted its own proxy voting policies and procedures policies and proxy voting guidelines guidelines for this purpose the policies address among other things conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the fund and the interests of the advisor and its affiliates including the funds principal underwriter the guidelines set forth the advisors general position on various proposals such as o shareholder rights  the advisor generally votes against proposals that restrict shareholder rights o corporate governance  the advisor generally votes for confidential and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements for charter and bylaw amendments the advisor generally votes for proposals to restrict a chief executive officer from serving on more than three outside boards of directors the advisor generally votes against proposals that require a company to appoint a chairman who is an independent director o antitakeover matters  the advisor generally votes for proposals that require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that request boards to redeem poison pills and votes against the adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder ratification the advisor generally votes for fair price proposals o compensation matters  the advisor generally votes for executive cash compensation proposals unless they are unreasonably excessive the advisor generally votes against stock option plans that do not meet the advisors criteria o routine matters  the advisor generally votes for the ratification of auditors procedural matters related to the annual meeting and changes in company name and against bundled proposals and adjournment the general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies the advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment companies in accordance with the recommendations of an independent third party except for proxies solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as the advisor or principal underwriter affiliated investment companies the advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies in the same proportion as the vote of the investment companys other shareholders sometimes called mirror or echo voting master fund proxies solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements of the investment company act of  although the guidelines set forth the advisors general voting positions on various proposals the advisor may consistent with the funds best interests determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd the guidelines on a particular issue may or may not reflect the view of individual members of the board or of a majority of the board in addition the guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices of the public companies within the deutsche bank organization or of the investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment advisor or sponsor the advisor may consider the views of a portfolio companys management in deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the guidelines but managements views are not determinative as mentioned above the policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves conflicts of interest to resolve conflicts the advisor under normal circumstances votes proxies in accordance with its guidelines if the advisor departs from the guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal a proxy voting committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy before voting any such proxy however the advisors conflicts review committee will conduct an investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in connection with the particular proxy proposal if the conflicts review committee determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest or certain individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating in a particular proxy vote it will inform the proxy voting committee if notified that the advisor has a material conflict or fewer than three voting members are eligible to participate in the proxy vote typically the advisor will engage an independent third party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy voting recommendations of an independent third party under certain circumstances the advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the advisor may find that the expected economic costs from voting outweigh the benefits associated with voting for example the advisor may not vote proxies on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs the advisor generally does not vote proxies on securities subject to share blocking restrictions you may obtain information

securities invests most or all of its investment assets in a separate registered investment company the master fund with substantially the same investment objective and policies as the feeder fund such a structure permits the pooling of assets of two or more feeder funds preserving separate identities or distribution channels at the feeder fund level based on the premise that certain of the expenses of operating an investment portfolio are relatively fixed a larger investment portfolio may eventually achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average net assets an existing investment company is able to convert to a feeder fund by selling all of its investments which involves brokerage and other transaction costs and realization of a taxable gain or loss or by contributing its

and techniques general the fund is an openend management investment company which continuously offers and redeems shares at net asset value less applicable sales charges or fees the fund is a company of the type commonly known as a mutual fund the fund offers four classes of shares class a class c class s and institutional class class a class c and institutional class shares of the fund are offered through a separate statement of additional information investment objective and policies the fund seeks longterm capital appreciation with current income as a secondary objective under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its assets determined at the time of purchase in the stocks and other securities with equity characteristics of companies in developed countries outside the united states almost all the companies in which the fund invests are based in the developed foreign countries that make up the morgan stanley capital international europe australia and ear east index msci eafe index the fund may also invest a portion of its assets in companies based in the emerging markets of latin america the middle east europe asia and africa if the portfolio managers believe that their return potential more than compensates for the extra risks associated with these markets while the portfolio managers have invested in emerging markets in the past under normal market conditions they do not consider this a central element of the funds strategy typically the fund would not hold more than  of its net assets in emerging markets in implementing this overall strategy the fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate the fund may also invest up to  of its assets in cash equivalents us investmentgrade fixedincome securities and us stocks and other equities the fund invests for the long term the portfolio managers employ a value strategy and invest in companies that they believe are undervalued these are typically companies that have been historically sound but are temporarily out of favor the fund intends to invest primarily in companies whose market capitalizations fall within the normal range of the msci eafe index the portfolio managers track several thousand companies to arrive at between  to  stocks the fund normally holds the managers use a variety of quantitative screens to compare a companys stock price to its book value cash flow and dividend yield and analyze individual companies to identify those that are financially sound and appear to have strong potential for longterm growth after narrowing the investment universe through the use of valuation screens the portfolio managers use of fundamental research tools lies at the heart of the investment process the portfolio managers process brings an added dimension to this fundamental research by drawing on the insight of experts from a range of financial disciplines  regional stock market specialists global industry specialists economists and quantitative analysts they challenge refine and amplify each others ideas their close collaboration is a critical element of the portfolio managers investment process the fund may invest in various instruments commonly known as derivatives to increase or decrease its exposure to an asset class securities market index or currency the fund will primarily use futures options options on futures forward currency transactions and swaps the fund may also invest in derivatives to gain exposure to the market while at the same time maintaining a high degree of liquidity in order to meet shareholder redemptions or other needs use of some derivatives may have the effect of leveraging the funds exposure to a particular asset class or other investment which heightens risk but may also allow for enhanced returns in implementing this strategy the fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate investment techniques descriptions in this statement of additional information of a particular investment practice or technique in which the fund may engage are meant to describe the spectrum of investments that the advisor or the subadvisor  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th hereinafter the advisor in its discretion might but is not required to use in managing the funds portfolio assets the advisor may in its discretion at any time employ such a practice technique or instrument for one or more funds but not for all funds advised by it furthermore it is possible that certain types of financial instruments or investment techniques described herein may not be available permissible economically feasible or effective for their intended purposes in all markets certain practices techniques or instruments may not be principal activities of the fund but to the extent employed could from time to time have a material impact on the funds performance the fund may engage in certain practices not described herein borrowing as a matter of fundamental policy the fund may not borrow money except as permitted under the  act and as interpreted or modified by regulatory authority having jurisdiction from time to time while the fund does not currently intend to borrow for investment leveraging purposes if such a strategy were implemented in the future it would increase the funds volatility and the risk of loss in a declining market borrowing by the fund will involve special risk considerations the funds assets may change in value during the time a borrowing is outstanding thus increasing exposure to capital risk common stocks common stock is issued by companies to raise cash for business purposes and represents a proportionate interest in the issuing companies therefore the fund participates in the success or failure of any company in which it holds stock the market values of common stock can fluctuate significantly reflecting the business performance of the issuing company investor perception and general economic and financial market movements despite the risk of price volatility however common stocks have historically offered a greater potential for longterm gain on investment compared to other classes of financial assets such as bonds or cash equivalents although there can be no assurance that this will be true in the future convertible securities the fund may invest in convertible securities that is bonds notes debentures preferred stocks and other securities which are convertible into common stock investments in convertible securities can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation andor income through interest and dividend payments by virtue of their conversion or exchange features the convertible securities in which the fund may invest are either fixed income or zero coupon debt securities which may be converted or exchanged at a stated or determinable exchange ratio into underlying shares of common stock the exchange ratio for any particular convertible security may be adjusted from time to time due to stock splits dividends spinoffs other corporate distributions or scheduled changes in the exchange ratio convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stocks until converted have general characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities although to a lesser extent than with debt securities generally the market value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates increase and conversely tends to increase as interest rates decline in addition because of the conversion or exchange feature the market value of convertible securities typically changes as the market value of the underlying common stocks changes and therefore also tends to follow movements in the general market for equity securities a unique feature of convertible securities is that as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the prices of the convertible securities tend to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock although typically not as much as the underlying common stock while no securities investments are without risk investments in convertible securities generally entail less risk than investments in common stock of the same issuer as debt securities convertible securities are investments which provide for a stream of income or in the case of zero coupon securities accretion of income with generally higher yields than common stocks convertible securities generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality because of their conversion or exchange features of course like all debt securities there can be no assurance of income or principal payments because the issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations convertible securities generally are subordinated to other similar but nonconvertible securities of the same issuer although convertible bonds as corporate debt obligations enjoy seniority in right of payment to all equity securities  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th and convertible preferred stock is senior to common stock of the same issuer however because of the subordination feature convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock typically have lower ratings than similar nonconvertible securities convertible securities may be issued as fixed income obligations that pay current income or as zero coupon notes and bonds including liquid yield option notes lyonstm debt securities the fund may invest in debt securities including bonds of private issuers portfolio debt investments will be selected on the basis of among other things credit quality and the fundamental outlooks for currency economic and interest rate trends taking into account the ability to hedge a degree of currency or local bond price risk the fund may purchase investmentgrade bonds rated aaa aa a or baa by moodys or aaa aa a or bbb by sp or if unrated judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor the principal risks involved with investments in bonds include interest rate risk credit risk and prepayment risk interest rate risk refers to the likely decline in the value of bonds as interest rates rise generally longerterm securities are more susceptible to changes in value as a result of interestrate changes than are shorterterm securities credit risk refers to the risk that an issuer of a bond may default with respect to the payment of principal and interest the lower a bond is rated the more it is considered to be a speculative or risky investment prepayment risk is commonly associated with pooled debt securities such as mortgagebacked securities and asset backed securities but may affect other debt securities as well when the underlying debt obligations are prepaid ahead of schedule the return on the security will be lower than expected prepayment rates usually increase when interest rates are falling depositary receipts the fund may invest in sponsored or unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs international depositary receipts idrs and other types of depositary receipts which together with adrs edrs gdrs and idrs are hereinafter referred to as depositary receipts depositary receipts provide indirect investment in securities of foreign issuers prices of unsponsored depositary receipts may be more volatile than if they were sponsored by the issuer of the underlying securities depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which they may be converted in addition the issuers of the stock of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the united states and therefore there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts adrs are depositary receipts which are bought and sold in the united states and are typically issued by a us bank or trust company and which evidence ownership of underlying securities by a foreign corporation gdrs idrs and other types of depositary receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies although they may also be issued by united states banks or trust companies and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by either a foreign or a united states corporation generally depositary receipts in registered form are designed for use in the united states securities markets and depositary receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities markets outside the united states for purposes of the funds investment policies the funds investments in adrs gdrs and other types of depositary receipts will be deemed to be investments in the underlying securities depositary receipts including those denominated in us dollars will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk however by investing in us dollardenominated adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock the fund avoids currency risks during the settlement period in general there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs however certain depositary receipts may not be listed on an exchange and therefore may be illiquid securities eurodollar instruments the fund may make investments in eurodollar instruments for hedging purposes or to enhance potential gain eurodollar instruments are us dollardenominated futures contracts or options thereon which are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor although foreign currencydenominated instruments are available from time to time eurodollar futures contracts enable purchasers to obtain a fixed rate for the lending of funds and sellers to obtain a fixed rate for borrowings the fund might use eurodollar futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in libor to which many interest rate swaps and fixed income instruments are linked eurodollar obligations eurodollar bank obligations are us dollardenominated certificates of deposit and time deposits issued outside the us capital markets by foreign branches of us banks and us branches of foreign banks  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th eurodollar obligations are subject to the same risks that pertain to domestic issues notably credit risk market risk and liquidity risk additionally eurodollar obligations are subject to certain sovereign risks foreign currencies because investments in foreign securities usually will involve currencies of foreign countries and because the fund may hold foreign currencies and forward contracts futures contracts options on foreign currencies and foreign currency futures contracts and other currencyrelated instruments the value of the assets of the fund as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs and experience conversion difficulties and uncertainties in connection with conversions between various currencies fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the earning power and asset value of the foreign entity issuing the security the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies is responsible for part of the funds investment performance if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen for example the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall many foreign currencies have experienced significant devaluation relative to the dollar although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis it will do so from time to time and investors should be aware of the costs of currency conversion although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire to resell that currency to the dealer the fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through entering into options or forward or futures contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies foreign fixed income securities since most foreign fixed income securities are not rated a fund will invest in foreign fixed income securities based on the advisors analysis without relying on published ratings since such investments will be based upon the advisors analysis rather than upon published ratings achievement of a funds goals may depend more upon the abilities of the advisor than would otherwise be the case the value of the foreign fixed income securities held by a fund and thus the net asset value of a funds shares generally will fluctuate with a changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the issuers of those securities b movements in interest rates and c changes in the relative values of the currencies in which a funds investments in fixed income securities are denominated with respect to the us dollar the extent of the fluctuation will depend on various factors such as the average maturity of a funds investments in foreign fixed income securities and the extent to which a fund hedges its interest rate credit and currency exchange rate risks a longer average maturity generally is associated with a higher level of volatility in the market value of such securities in response to changes in market conditions investments in sovereign debt including brady bonds brady bonds are debt securities issued under a plan implemented to allow debtor nations to restructure their outstanding commercial bank indebtedness involve special risks foreign governmental issuers of debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or pay interest when due in the event of default there may be limited or no legal recourse in that generally remedies for defaults must be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party political conditions especially a sovereign entitys willingness to meet the terms of its fixed income securities are of considerable significance also there can be no assurance that the holders of commercial bank loans to the same sovereign entity may not contest payments to the holders of sovereign debt in the event of default under commercial bank loan agreements in addition there is no bankruptcy proceeding with respect to sovereign debt on which a sovereign has defaulted and a fund may be unable to collect all or any part of its investment in a particular issue foreign investment in certain sovereign debt is restricted or controlled to varying degrees including requiring governmental approval for the repatriation of income capital or proceed of sales by foreign investors these restrictions or controls may at times limit or preclude foreign investment in certain sovereign debt or increase the costs and expenses of a fund  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th sovereign debt of emerging market governmental issuers is to be considered speculative emerging market governmental issuers are among the largest debtors to commercial banks foreign governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions certain emerging market governmental issuers have not been able to make payments of interest on or principal of debt obligations as those payments have come due there is a history of defaults with respect to commercial bank loans by public and private entities issuing sovereign debt all or a portion of the interest payments andor principal repayment with respect to sovereign debt may be uncollateralized obligations arising from past restructuring agreements may affect the economic performance and political and social stability of those issuers the ability of emerging market country governmental issuers to make timely payments on their obligations is likely to be influenced strongly by the issuers balance of payments including export performance and its access to international credits and investments an emerging market whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities could be vulnerable to a decline in the international prices of one or more of those commodities increased protectionism on the part of an emerging markets trading partners could also adversely affect the countrys exports and diminish its trade account surplus if any to the extent that emerging markets receive payment for its exports in currencies other than dollars or nonemerging market currencies its ability to make debt payments denominated in dollars or nonemerging market currencies could be affected another factor bearing on the ability of emerging market countries to repay debt obligations is the level of international reserves of the country fluctuations in the level of these reserves affect the amount of foreign exchange readily available for external debt payments and thus could have a bearing on the capacity of emerging market countries to make payments on these debt obligations to the extent that an emerging market country cannot generate a trade surplus it must depend on continuing loans from foreign governments multilateral organizations or private commercial banks aid payments from foreign governments and inflows of foreign investment the access of emerging markets to these forms of external funding may not be certain and a withdrawal of external funding could adversely affect the capacity of emerging market country governmental issuers to make payments on their obligations in addition the cost of servicing emerging market debt obligations can be affected by a change in international interest rates since the majority of these obligations carry interest rates that are adjusted periodically based upon international rates foreign investment foreign securities are normally denominated and traded in foreign currencies as a result the value of the funds foreign investments and the value of its shares may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar there may be less information publicly available about a foreign issuer than about a us issuer and foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the us the securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers foreign brokerage commissions and other fees are also generally higher than in the us foreign settlement procedures and trade regulations may involve certain risks such as delay in payment or delivery of securities or in the recovery of the funds assets held abroad and expenses not present in the settlement of investments in us markets payment for securities without delivery may be required in certain foreign markets in addition foreign securities may be subject to the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets imposition of currency exchange controls or restrictions on the repatriation of foreign currency confiscatory taxation political or financial instability and diplomatic developments which could affect the value of the funds investments in certain foreign countries governments of many countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector through the ownership or control of many companies including some of the largest in these countries as a result government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions which may adversely affect prices of certain portfolio securities there is also generally less government supervision and regulation of stock exchanges brokers and listed companies than in the us dividends or interest on or proceeds from the sale of foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes and special us tax considerations may apply moreover foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th legal remedies available to investors in certain foreign countries may be more limited than those available with respect to investments in the us or in other foreign countries the laws of some foreign countries may limit the funds ability to invest in securities of certain issuers organized under the laws of those foreign countries of particular importance many foreign countries are heavily dependent upon exports particularly to developed countries and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the us and other countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by economic conditions in the us and other trading partners which can lower the demand for goods produced in those countries the risks described above including the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets typically are increased in connection with investments in emerging markets for example political and economic structures in these countries may be in their infancy and developing rapidly and such countries may lack the social political and economic stability characteristic of more developed countries including amplified risk of war and terrorism certain of these countries have in the past failed to recognize private property rights and have at times nationalized and expropriated the assets of private companies investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative the currencies of certain emerging market countries have experienced devaluations relative to the us dollar and future devaluations may adversely affect the value of assets denominated in such currencies in addition currency hedging techniques may be unavailable in certain emerging market countries many emerging market countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation or deflation for many years and future inflation may adversely affect the economies and securities markets of such countries in addition unanticipated political or social developments may affect the value of investments in emerging markets and the availability of additional investments in these markets any change in the leadership or politics of emerging market countries or the countries that exercise a significant influence over those countries may halt the expansion of or reverse the liberalization of foreign investment policies now occurring and adversely affect existing investment opportunities the small size limited trading volume and relative inexperience of the securities markets in these countries may make investments in securities traded in emerging markets illiquid and more volatile than investments in securities traded in more developed countries for example limited market size may cause prices to be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in addition the fund may be required to establish special custodial or other arrangements before making investments in securities traded in emerging markets there may be little financial or accounting information available with respect to issuers of emerging market securities and it may be difficult as a result to assess the value of prospects of an investment in such securities the risk also exists that an emergency situation may arise in one or more emerging markets as a result of which trading of securities may cease or may be substantially curtailed and prices for the funds securities in such markets may not be readily available the fund may suspend redemption of its shares for any period during which an emergency exists as determined by the sec accordingly if a fund believes that appropriate circumstances exist it may apply to the sec for a determination that an emergency is present during the period commencing from a funds identification of such condition until the date of the sec action the funds securities in the affected markets will be valued at fair value determined in good faith by or under the direction of the funds board certain of the foregoing risks may also apply to some extent to securities of us issuers that are denominated in foreign currencies or that are traded in foreign markets or securities of us issuers having significant foreign operations high yieldhigh risk bonds the fund may also purchase debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor these securities usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk to principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the higher rating categories the lower the ratings of such debt securities the more their risks render them like equity securities securities rated d may be in default with respect to payment of principal or interest  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th issuers of such high yielding securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing therefore the risk associated with acquiring the securities of such issuers generally is greater than is the case with higher rated securities for example during an economic downturn or a sustained period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issuers of high yield securities may experience financial stress during such periods such issuers may not have sufficient revenues to meet their interest payment obligations the issuers ability to service its debt obligations may also be adversely affected by specific corporate developments or the issuers inability to meet specific projected business forecasts or the unavailability of additional financing the risk of loss from default by the issuer is significantly greater for the holders of high yield securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates the fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield high risk securities because they may have a thin trading market because not all dealers maintain markets in all high yield securities the fund anticipates that such securities could be sold only to a limited number of dealers or institutional investors the lack of a liquid secondary market may have an adverse effect on the market price and the funds ability to dispose of particular issues and may also make it more difficult for a fund to obtain accurate market quotations for purposes of valuing the funds assets market quotations generally are available on many high yield issues only from a limited number of dealers and may not necessarily represent firm bids of such dealers or prices for actual sales adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is generally the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of the funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of the fund to retain or dispose of such security illiquid securities and restricted securities the fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended the  act issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid the funds board has approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirement that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities the fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses the fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the  act when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event the fund may be liable  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading the fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them the fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between the funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which the fund is permitted or able to sell such security the fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell impact of large redemptions and purchases of fund shares from time to time shareholders of the fund which may include affiliated andor nonaffiliated registered investment companies that invest in the fund may make relatively large redemptions or purchases of fund shares these transactions may cause the fund to have to sell securities or invest additional cash as the case may be while it is impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time there could be adverse effects on the funds performance to the extent that the fund may be required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise do so these transactions could also accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales of securities resulted in capital gains and could also increase transaction costs which may impact the funds expense ratio ipo risk securities issued through an initial public offering ipo can experience an immediate drop in value if the demand for the securities does not continue to support the offering price information about the issuers of ipo securities is also difficult to acquire since they are new to the market and may not have lengthy operating histories the fund may engage in shortterm trading in connection with its ipo investments which could produce higher trading costs and adverse tax consequences the number of securities issued in an ipo is limited so it is likely that ipo securities will represent a smaller component of the funds portfolio as the funds assets increase and thus have a more limited effect on the funds performance interfund borrowing and lending program the fund has received exemptive relief from the sec which permits the fund to participate in an interfund lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend only overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent the fund is actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund lending program the fund will comply with their respective nonfundamental policies on borrowing investment company securities the fund may acquire securities of other investment companies to the extent consistent with its investment objective and subject to the limitations of the  act the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees and other expenses paid by such other investment companies for example the fund may invest in a variety of investment companies which seek to track the composition and performance of specific

investment securities to approved institutional borrowers including those who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions such as covering short sales avoiding failures to deliver securities or completing arbitrage operations by lending its investment securities the fund attempts to increase its net investment income through the receipt of interest on the loan any gain or loss in the market price of the securities loaned that might occur during the term of the loan would belong to the fund the fund may lend its investment securities so long as the terms structure and the aggregate amount of such loans are not inconsistent with the  act or the rules and regulations or interpretations of the sec thereunder which currently require that a the borrower pledge and maintain with the fund collateral consisting of liquid unencumbered assets having a value at all times not less than  of the value of the securities loaned b the borrower add to such collateral whenever the price of the securities loaned rises ie the borrower marks to the market on a daily basis c the loan be made subject to termination by the fund at any time and d the fund receives reasonable interest on the loan which may include the fund investing any cash collateral in interest bearing shortterm investments and distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in their market value there may be risks of delay in recovery of the securities or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially however loans will be made only to borrowers selected by the funds delegate after a commercially reasonable review of relevant facts and circumstances including the creditworthiness of the borrower at the present time the staff of the sec does not object if an investment company pays reasonable negotiated fees in connection with loaned securities so long as such fees are set forth in a written contract and approved by the investment companys board of directors in addition voting rights may pass with the loaned securities but if a material event occurs affecting an investment on loan the loan must be called and the securities voted pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the sec cash collateral received by the fund may be invested in a money market fund managed by the advisor or one of its affiliates microcap company risk while historically microcapitalization company stocks have outperformed the stocks of large companies the former have customarily involved more investment risk as well there can be no assurance that this will continue to be true in the future microcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies the prices of microcapitalization company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because microcapitalization companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for the fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices some of the companies in which the fund may invest may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the securities of microcapitalization companies are often traded overthecounter and may not be traded in the volumes typical on a national securities exchange consequently in order to sell this type of holding the fund may need to discount the securities from recent prices or dispose of the securities over a long period of time participation interests the fund may purchase from financial institutions participation interests in securities in which the fund may invest a participation interest gives the fund an undivided interest in the security in the proportion that the funds participation interest bears to the principal amount of the security these instruments may have fixed floating or variable interest rates with remaining maturities of  days or less if the participation interest is unrated or has been given a rating below that which is permissible for purchase by the fund the participation interest will be backed by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of a bank or the payment obligation otherwise will be collateralized by us government securities or in the case of unrated participation interest determined by the advisor to be of comparable quality to those instruments in which the fund may invest for certain participation interests the fund will have the right to demand payment on not more than seven days notice for all or any part of the funds participation interests in the security plus accrued interest as to these instruments the fund generally intends to exercise its right to demand payment only upon a default under

currently undergoing privatization the governments of certain foreign countries have to varying degrees embarked on privatization programs contemplating the sale of all or part of their interests in state enterprises the funds investments in the securities of privatized enterprises may include privately negotiated investments in a government or stateowned or controlled company or enterprise that has not yet conducted an initial equity offering investments in the initial offering of equity securities of a state enterprise or former state enterprise and investments in the securities of a state enterprise following its initial equity offering in certain jurisdictions the ability of foreign entities such as the fund to participate in privatizations may be limited by local law or the price or terms on which the fund may be able to participate may be less advantageous than for local investors moreover there can be no assurance that governments that have embarked on privatization programs will continue to divest their ownership of state enterprises that proposed privatizations will be successful or that governments will not renationalize enterprises that have been privatized in the case of the enterprises in which the fund may invest large blocks of the stock of those enterprises may be held by a small group of stockholders even after the initial equity offerings by those enterprises the sale of some portion or all of those blocks could have an adverse effect on the price of the stock of any such enterprise prior to making an initial equity offering most state enterprises or former state enterprises go through an internal reorganization or management such reorganizations are made in an attempt to better enable these enterprises to compete in the private sector however certain reorganizations could result in a management team that does not function as well as an enterprises prior management and may have a negative effect on such enterprise in addition the privatization of an enterprise by its government may occur over a number of years with the government continuing to hold a controlling position in the enterprise even after the initial equity offering for the enterprise prior to privatization most of the state enterprises in which the fund may invest enjoy the protection of and receive preferential treatment from the respective sovereigns that own or control them after making an initial equity offering these enterprises may no longer have such protection or receive such preferential treatment and may become subject to market competition from which they were previously protected some of these enterprises may not be able to operate effectively in a competitive market and may suffer losses or experience bankruptcy due to such competition real estate investment trusts reits reits are sometimes informally categorized into equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits investment in reits may subject the fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate such as decreases in real estate values overbuilding increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions increases in operating costs and property taxes changes in zoning laws casualty or condemnation losses possible environmental liabilities regulatory limitations on rent and fluctuations in rental income equity reits generally experience these risks directly through fee or leasehold interests whereas mortgage reits generally experience these risks indirectly through mortgage interests unless the mortgage reit forecloses on the underlying real estate changes in interest rates may also affect the value of the funds investment in reits for instance during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those reits certain reits have relatively small market capitalizations which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of their securities furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills have limited diversification and are therefore subject to risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the code and to maintain exemption from the registration requirements of the  act by investing in reits indirectly through the fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the fund but also indirectly expenses of the reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th repurchase agreements the fund may enter in repurchase agreements pursuant to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement the fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer a repurchase agreement provides a means for the fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie the fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and as described in more detail below and the value of such securities kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to the fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to the fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case the income to the fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by the fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by the fund or as being collateral for a loan by the fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement the fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and the fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation the fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor the fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt instrument purchased for the fund the advisor seeks to minimize the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case the fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to the fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value including interest of the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest the fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value including interest of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price repurchase commitments the fund may enter into repurchase commitments with any party deemed creditworthy by the advisor including foreign banks and brokerdealers if the transaction is entered into for investment purposes and the counterpartys creditworthiness is at least equal to that of issuers of securities which the fund may purchase such transactions may not provide the fund with collateral markedtomarket during the term of the commitment reverse repurchase agreements the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which the fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase them at an agreed time and price the fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and its yield small company risk the advisor believes that many small companies may have sales and earnings growth rates which exceed those of larger companies and that such growth rates may in turn be reflected in more rapid share price appreciation over time however investing in smaller company stocks involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger more established companies for example smaller companies can have limited product lines markets or financial and managerial resources smaller companies may also be dependent on one or a few key persons and may be more susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy also the securities of smaller companies may be thinly traded and therefore have to be sold at a discount from current market prices or sold in small lots over an extended period of time transaction costs in smaller company stocks may be higher than those of larger companies sovereign debt investment in sovereign debt can involve a high degree of risk the governmental entity that controls the repayment of sovereign debt may not be able or willing to repay the principal andor interest when due  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th in accordance with the terms of such debt a governmental entitys willingness or ability to repay principal and interest due in a timely manner may be affected by among other factors its cash flow situation the extent of its foreign reserves the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole the governmental entitys policy toward the international monetary fund and the political constraints to which a governmental entity may be subject governmental entities may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments multilateral agencies and others abroad to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt the commitment on the part of these governments agencies and others to make such disbursements may be conditioned on a governmental entitys implementation of economic reforms andor economic performance and the timely service of such debtors obligations failure to implement such reforms achieve such levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of such third parties commitments to lend funds to the governmental entity which may further impair such debtors ability or willingness to service its debts in a timely manner consequently governmental entities may default on their sovereign debt holders of sovereign debt may be requested to participate in the rescheduling of such debt and to extend further loans to governmental entities there is no bankruptcy proceeding by which sovereign debt on which governmental entities have defaulted may be collected in whole or in part strategic transactions and derivatives the fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of the fixedincome securities in the funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies the fund may purchase and sell exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity and fixedincome indices and other instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors collars currency forward contracts currency futures contracts currency swaps or options on currencies or currency futures and various other currency transactions collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include additional techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit subject to certain limits imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for the funds portfolio resulting from securities markets or currency exchange rate fluctuations to protect the funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of the funds portfolio to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or for any other purpose permitted by applicable law some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of the funds assets will be committed to certain strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of the fund to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the fund will comply with applicable regulatory requirements when implementing these strategies techniques and instruments strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of the fund and the fund will segregate assets or as provided by applicable regulations enter into certain offsetting positions to cover its obligations under options futures and swaps to limit leveraging of the fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on its investments or cause the fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of currency transactions can result in a fund incurring losses as a result of a number of factors including the imposition of exchange controls suspension of settlements or the inability to deliver or receive a specified currency the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th may be greater than gains in the value of the funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets the fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchases of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium other strategic transactions such as forward contracts and swaps are also subject to similar risks losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance the funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving the fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price the funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect the fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto the fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option the funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties the fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting the fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to the fund at a formula price within seven days the fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although it is not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with the fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option the fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied the fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or in the case of otc currency transactions are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by the fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of the funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to the funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if the fund sells a call option the premium that it receives may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in its portfolio or will increase the funds income the sale of put options can also provide income the fund may purchase and sell call options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts all calls sold by the fund must be covered ie the fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though the fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by the fund exposes the fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require the fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold the fund may purchase and sell put options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities foreign sovereign debt corporate debt securities equity securities including convertible securities and eurodollar instruments whether or not it holds the above securities in its portfolio and on securities indices currencies and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities the fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that the fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures the fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate currency or equity market changes and for duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to certain instruments such as index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount and a firm obligations by the buyer to deliver the specified price options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position the fund has claimed exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act therefore the fund is not subject to commodity pool operator registration and regulation under the commodity exchange act futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires the fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the marked to market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of the fund if the fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur options on securities indices and other financial indices the fund also may purchase and sell call and put options on securities indices and other financial indices and in so doing can achieve many of the same objectives it would achieve through the sale or purchase of options on individual securities or other instruments options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option on an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making up the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities currency transactions the fund may engage in currency transactions with counterparties primarily in order to hedge or manage the risk of the value of portfolio holdings denominated in particular currencies against fluctuations in relative value currency transactions include forward currency contracts exchange listed currency futures exchange listed and otc options on currencies and currency swaps a forward currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows based on the notional difference among two or more currencies and operates similarly to an interest rate swap which is described below the fund may enter into currency transactions with counterparties which have received or the guarantors of the obligations which have received a credit rating of a or p by sp or moodys respectively or that have an equivalent rating from a nrsro or except for otc currency options are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the funds dealings in forward currency contracts and other currency transactions such as futures options options on futures and swaps generally will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except as described below transaction hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of the fund which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of income therefrom position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the fund generally will not enter into a transaction to hedge currency exposure to an extent greater after netting all transactions intended wholly or partially to offset other transactions than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the transaction of the securities held in its portfolio that are denominated or generally quoted in or currently convertible into such currency other than with respect to proxy hedging or cross hedging as described below as applicable the fund may also crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which the fund has or in which the fund expects to have portfolio exposure to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of portfolio securities the fund may also engage in proxy hedging proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which the funds portfolio is exposed is difficult to hedge or to hedge against the dollar proxy hedging entails entering into a commitment or option to sell a currency whose changes in value are generally considered to be correlated to a currency or currencies in which some or all of the funds portfolio securities are or are expected to be denominated in exchange for us dollars currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments currency transactions can result in losses to the fund if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further there is the risk that the perceived correlation between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time that the fund is engaging in proxy hedging if the fund enters into a currency hedging transaction the fund will comply with the asset segregation requirements described below as applicable risks of currency transactions currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses to the fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs buyers and sellers of currency futures are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures generally further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures is relatively new and the ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid market which may not always be available currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that countrys economy risks of strategic transactions outside the us when conducted outside the us strategic transactions may not be regulated as rigorously as in the us may not involve a clearing mechanism and related guarantees and are subject to the risk of governmental actions affecting trading in or the prices of foreign securities currencies and other instruments the value of such positions also could be adversely affected by i other complex foreign political legal and economic factors ii lesser availability than in the us of data on which to make trading decisions iii delays in the funds ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets during nonbusiness hours in the us iv the imposition of different exercise and settlement terms and procedures and margin requirements than in the us and v lower trading volume and liquidity swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which the fund may enter are interest rate currency index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars the fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique to protect against any increase in the price of securities the fund anticipates purchasing at a later date or to enhance returns the fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values use of segregated and other special accounts many strategic transactions in addition to other requirements require that the fund segregate cash or liquid assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by the fund to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid assets at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by the fund will require the fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by the fund on an index will require the fund to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by the fund requires the fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price except when the fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency which requires no segregation a currency contract which obligates the fund to buy or sell currency will generally require the fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid assets denominated in that currency equal to the funds obligations or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the amount of the funds obligation otc options entered into by the fund including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when the fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by the fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when the fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price the fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by the fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and the fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon the fund must deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition to segregating cash or liquid assets sufficient to meet its obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such liquid assets may consist of cash cash equivalents liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps the fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of its obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars require segregation of assets with a value equal to the funds net obligation if any strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies the fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and strategic transactions for example the fund could purchase a  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by the fund moreover instead of segregating cash or liquid assets if the fund held a futures or forward contract it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held other strategic transactions may also be offset in combinations if the offsetting transaction terminates at the time of or after the primary transaction no segregation is required but if it terminates prior to such time cash or liquid assets equal to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated combined transactions the fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single strategic transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of the advisor it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on the advisors judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective supranational entities supranational entities are international organizations designated or supported by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development and international banking institutions and related government agencies examples include the international bank for

by the guarantee of one or more foreign governmental parties which sponsor the entity whenissued securities the fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued delayed delivery or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund when the fund purchases such securities it immediately assumes the risks of ownership including the risk of price fluctuation failure to deliver a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment to the extent that assets of the fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities the fund would earn no income while such securities may be sold prior to the settlement date the fund intends to purchase them with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on this basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the securities may be more or less than the purchase price the fund will establish a segregated account in which it will maintain cash and liquid securities equal in value to commitments for such securities warrants the fund may invest in warrants up to  of the value of its total assets the holder of a warrant has the right until the warrant expires to purchase a given number of shares of a particular issuer at a specified price such investments can provide a greater potential for profit or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security prices of warrants do not necessarily move however in tandem with the prices of the underlying securities and are therefore considered speculative investments warrants pay no dividends and confer no rights other than a purchase option thus if a warrant held by the fund were not exercised by the date of its expiration the fund would lose the entire purchase price of the warrant zero coupon securities the fund may invest in zero coupon securities which pay no cash income and are sold at substantial discounts from their value at maturity when held to maturity their entire income which consists of accretion of discount comes from the difference between the purchase price and their value at maturity the effect of owning instruments which do not make current interest payments is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount accretion during the life of the obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest distributions at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the zero coupon bond but at the same time eliminates any opportunity to reinvest earnings at  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd higher rates for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than those of comparable securities that pay interest currently which fluctuation is greater as the period to maturity is longer zero coupon convertible securities which are convertible into common stock offer the opportunity for capital appreciation or depreciation as increases or decreases in market value of such securities closely follow the movements in the market value of the underlying common stock zero coupon convertible securities generally are expected to be less volatile than the underlying common stocks as they usually are issued with maturities of  years or less and are issued with options andor redemption features exercisable by the holder of the

manages the funds investments references in this section to the advisor should be read to mean the subadvisor except as noted below the policy of the advisor in placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities for the funds is to seek best execution taking into account such factors among others as price commission where applicable the brokerdealers ability to ensure that securities will be delivered on settlement date the willingness of the brokerdealer to commit its capital and purchase a thinly traded security for its own inventory whether the brokerdealer specializes in block orders or large program trades the brokerdealers knowledge of the market and the security the brokerdealers ability to maintain confidentiality the brokerdealers ability to provide access to new issues the brokerdealers ability to provide support when placing a difficult trade the financial condition of the brokerdealer and whether the brokerdealer has the infrastructure and operational capabilities to execute and settle the trade the advisor seeks to evaluate the overall reasonableness of brokerage commissions with commissions charged on comparable transactions and compares the brokerage commissions if any paid by the funds to reported commissions paid by others the advisor routinely reviews commission rates execution and settlement services performed and makes internal and

securities exchanges are generally fixed purchases and sales of fixedincome securities and certain overthecounter securities are effected on a net basis without the payment of brokerage commissions transactions in fixed income and certain overthecounter securities are generally placed by the advisor with the principal market makers for these securities unless the advisor reasonably believes more

underwriting fee paid  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th to the underwriter money market instruments are normally purchased in principal transactions directly from the issuer or from an underwriter or market maker it is likely that the brokerdealers selected based on the considerations described in this section will include firms that also sell shares of the funds to their customers however the advisor does not consider sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds and accordingly has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds the advisor is permitted by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  act when placing portfolio transactions for a fund to cause the fund to pay brokerage commissions in excess of that which another brokerdealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain research and brokerage services if the advisor determines that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the overall services provided the advisor may from time to time in reliance on section e of the  act execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers that provide research and brokerage services to the advisor consistent with the advisors policy regarding best execution where more than one broker is believed to be capable of providing best execution for a particular trade the advisor may take into consideration the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the brokerdealer to execute the trade although certain research and brokerage services from brokerdealers may be useful to a fund and to the advisor it is the opinion of the advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since the information must still be analyzed weighed and reviewed by the advisors staff to the extent that research and brokerage services of value are received by the advisor the advisor may avoid expenses that it might otherwise incur research and brokerage services received from a brokerdealer may be useful to the advisor and its affiliates in providing investment management services to all or some of its clients which includes a fund services received from brokerdealers that executed securities transactions for a portfolio will not necessarily be used by the advisor specifically to service such fund research and brokerage services provided by brokerdealers may include but are not limited to information on the economy industries groups of securities individual companies statistical information accounting and tax law interpretations political developments legal developments affecting portfolio securities technical market action pricing and appraisal services credit analysis risk measurement analysis performance analysis and measurement and analysis of corporate responsibility issues research and brokerage services are typically received in the form of written or electronic reports access to specialized financial publications telephone contacts and personal meetings with security analysts but may also be provided in the form of access to various computer software and meetings arranged with corporate and industry representatives the advisor may also select brokerdealers and obtain from them research and brokerage services that are used in connection with executing trades provided that such services are consistent with interpretations under section e of the  act typically these services take the form of computer software andor electronic communication services used by the advisor to facilitate trading activity with those brokerdealers research and brokerage services may include products obtained from third parties if the advisor determines that such product or service constitutes brokerage and research as defined in section e and interpretations thereunder currently it is the advisors policy that subadvisors may not execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the funds to obtain third party research and brokerage services the advisor may in the future change this policy regardless certain subadvisors may as matter of internal policy limit or preclude third party research and brokerage services the advisor may use brokerage commissions to obtain certain brokerage products or services that have a mixed use ie it also serves a function that does not relate to the investment decisionmaking process in those circumstances the advisor will make a good faith judgment to evaluate the various benefits and uses to which it intends to put the mixed use product or service and will pay for that portion of the mixed use product or service that it reasonably believes does not constitute research and brokerage services with its own resources dima will monitor regulatory

income designated by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to longterm capital gain provided holding period and other requirements are met at both the shareholder and fund levels distributions are taxable to shareholders even if they are paid from income or gains earned by the fund before a shareholders investment and thus were included in the price the shareholder paid distributions are taxable whether shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares through the reinvestment privilege a shareholder whose distributions are reinvested in shares will be treated as having received a dividend equal to either i the fair market value of the new shares issued to the shareholder or ii if the shares are trading below net asset value the amount of cash allocated to the shareholder for the purchase of shares on its behalf in the open market any gain resulting from the sale or exchange of fund shares generally will be taxable as capital gains longterm capital gain rates applicable to individuals have been temporarily reduced  in general to  with lower rates applying to taxpayers in the

to longterm capital gain in order for some portion of the dividends received by the fund shareholder to be qualified dividend income the fund must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividend paying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to the funds shares a dividend will not be

tradable on an established securities market in the united states or b treated as a passive foreign investment company in general distributions of investment income designated by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified dividend income by a shareholder taxed as an individual provided the shareholder meets the holding period and other requirements described above with respect to the funds shares if the aggregate qualified dividends received by the fund during any taxable year are  or more of its gross income then  of the funds dividends other than dividends properly designated as capital gain dividends will be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income for this purpose the only gain included in the term gross income is the excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss special tax rules apply to investments through defined contribution plans and other taxqualified plans shareholders should consult their tax adviser to determine the suitability of shares of a fund as an investment through such plans and the precise effect of and investment on their particular tax situation all distributions by the fund result in a reduction in the net asset value of that funds shares should a distribution reduce the net asset value below a shareholders cost basis such distribution would nevertheless be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above even though from an investment standpoint it may constitute a partial return of capital in particular investors should be careful to consider the tax implications of buying shares just prior to a distribution the price of shares purchased at that time includes the amount of the forthcoming distribution those purchasing just prior to a distribution will receive a partial return of capital upon the distribution which will nevertheless be taxable to them capital gains distributions may be reduced if fund capital loss

respect to income possibly including in some cases capital gains on certain foreign securities may occur these taxes may be reduced or eliminated under the terms of an applicable us income tax treaty if more than  of the funds assets at year end consist of the securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to permit shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for their pro rata portion the qualified taxes paid by the fund to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities the fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the code in such a case  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes a shareholders ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of foreign taxes paid by the fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the code as a result of which a shareholder may not get a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes in particular shareholders must hold their fund shares without protection from risk of loss on the exdividend date and for at least  additional days during the day period surrounding the exdividend date to be eligible to claim a foreign tax credit with respect to a given dividend shareholders who do not itemize on their federal income tax returns may claim a credit but no deduction for such foreign taxes if the fund does not make the election discussed above shareholders will not be able to claim either a credit or a deduction for their pro rata portion of such

transactions in foreign currencies foreigncurrencydenominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options futures contracts and forward contracts and similar instruments may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned passive foreign investment companies equity investments by the fund in certain passive foreign investment companies pfics could potentially subject the fund to a us federal income tax including interest charges on distributions received from the company or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the company which tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders however the fund may elect to avoid the imposition of that tax for example the fund may elect to treat a pfic as a qualified electing fund a qef election in which case the fund would be required to include its share of the companys income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether it receives any distribution from the company the fund also may make an election to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in such holdings to the market as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in those pfics on the last day of the funds taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation making either of these elections therefore may require the fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the funds total return dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income tax effects of certain transactions the funds investment in zero coupon bonds and other debt obligations having original issue discount may cause the fund to recognize taxable income in excess of any cash received from the investment a portion of the difference between the issue price of zero coupon securities and their face value original issue discount is considered to be income to the fund each year even though the fund will not receive cash interest payments from these securities this original issue discount imputed income will comprise a part of the investment company taxable income of the fund which must be distributed to shareholders in order to maintain the qualification of the fund as a regulated investment company and to avoid federal income tax at the funds level some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance and all zerocoupon debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance that are acquired by the fund will be treated as debt obligations that are issued originally at a discount generally the amount of the original issue discount oid is treated as interest income and is included in taxable income and required to be distributed over the term of the debt security even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time usually when the debt security matures in addition paymentinkind securities will give rise to income which is required to be distributed and is taxable even though the fund holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance that are acquired by the fund in the secondary market may be treated as having market discount generally any gain recognized on the disposition of and any partial payment of principal on a debt security having market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain or principal payment does not exceed the accrued market discount on such debt security market discount generally accrues in equal daily installments the fund may make one or more of  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st the elections applicable to debt obligations having market discount which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income in addition if the fund invests in certain high yield original issue discount obligations issued by corporations including taxexempt obligations a portion of the original issue discount accruing on the obligation may be treated as taxable dividend income in such event dividends of investment company taxable income received from the fund by its shareholders to the extent attributable to such portion of accrued original issue discount would be taxable any such dividends received by the funds corporate shareholders may be eligible for the deduction for dividends received by corporations any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income a market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below its redemption value or its adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount absent an election to include the market discount in income as it accrues gain on the disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income instead of capital gain to the extent of accrued market discount the fund may invest to a significant extent in debt obligations that are in the lowest rating categories or are unrated including debt obligations of issuers not currently paying interest or who are in default investments in debt obligations that are at risk of or in default present special tax issues for the fund tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when the fund may cease to accrue interest original issue discount or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income these and other related issues will be addressed by the fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax if the fund engages in hedging transactions including hedging transactions in options futures contracts and straddles or other similar transactions it will be subject to special tax rules including constructive sale marktomarket straddle wash sale and short sale rules the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the fund defer losses to the fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of the funds securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains or convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders the fund will endeavor to

general oversight the fund has delegated proxy voting to the advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted consistent with the funds best economic interests the advisor has adopted its own proxy voting policies and procedures policies and proxy voting guidelines guidelines for this purpose the policies address among other things conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the fund and the interests of the advisor and its affiliates including the funds principal underwriter the guidelines set forth the advisors general position on various proposals such as o shareholder rights  the advisor generally votes against proposals that restrict shareholder rights o corporate governance  the advisor generally votes for confidential and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements for charter and bylaw amendments the advisor generally votes for proposals to restrict a chief executive officer from serving on more than three outside boards of directors the advisor generally votes against proposals that require a company to appoint a chairman who is an independent director o antitakeover matters  the advisor generally votes for proposals that require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that request boards to redeem poison pills and votes against the adoption of poison pills if they are submitted for shareholder ratification the advisor generally votes for fair price proposals o compensation matters  the advisor generally votes for executive cash compensation proposals unless they are unreasonably excessive the advisor generally votes against stock option plans that do not meet the advisors criteria o routine matters  the advisor generally votes for the ratification of auditors procedural matters related to the annual meeting and changes in company name and against bundled proposals and adjournment the general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies the advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment companies in accordance with the recommendations of an independent third party except for proxies solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as the advisor or principal underwriter affiliated investment companies the advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies in the same proportion as the vote of the investment companys other shareholders sometimes called mirror or echo voting master fund proxies solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements of the investment company act of  although the guidelines set forth the advisors general voting positions on various proposals the advisor may consistent with the funds best interests determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the guidelines on a particular issue may or may not reflect the view of individual members of the board or of a majority of the board in addition the guidelines may reflect a voting position that differs from the actual practices of the public companies within the deutsche bank organization or of the investment companies for which the advisor or an affiliate serves as investment advisor or sponsor the advisor may consider the views of a portfolio companys management in deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the guidelines but managements views are not determinative as mentioned above the policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves conflicts of interest to resolve conflicts the advisor under normal circumstances votes proxies in accordance with its guidelines if the advisor departs from the guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal a proxy voting committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy before voting any such proxy however the advisors conflicts review committee will conduct an investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in connection with the particular proxy proposal if the conflicts review committee determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest or certain individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating in a particular proxy vote it will inform the proxy voting committee if notified that the advisor has a material conflict or fewer than three voting members are eligible to participate in the proxy vote typically the advisor will engage an independent third party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy voting recommendations of an independent third party under certain circumstances the advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the advisor may find that the expected economic costs from voting outweigh the benefits associated with voting for example the advisor may not vote proxies on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs the advisor generally does not vote proxies on securities subject to share blocking restrictions you may obtain information about how the fund voted proxies related to its
