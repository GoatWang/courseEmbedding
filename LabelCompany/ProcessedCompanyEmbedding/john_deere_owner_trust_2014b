class a notes fsf  class aa notes aaasf outlook stable  class ab notes aaasf outlook stable  class a notes aaasf outlook stable  class a notes aaasf outlook stable  certificates not rated fitchs stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the presale report titled john deere owner trust b dated aug   which is available at wwwfitchratingscom or by clicking on the link below key rating drivers high concentration of ag equipment jdot b is the seventh transaction to contain  ag equipment although ag equipment historical losses have been low a high concentration in the pool limits diversification and exposes the trust to other factors such as natural disasters eg droughts and floods however geographic diversity and equipment versatility help mitigate the high concentration consistent collateral concentrations the pool contains  ag and  co equipment these concentrations are consistent with those of jdot  furthermore the pool consists of  annualpay contracts which historically have experienced a lower level of losses versus other payment types sufficient credit enhancement initial hard credit enhancement ce for jdot b is  unchanged from jdot  the initial reserve in jdot b is  while the subordinated certificates provide  enhancement initial excess spread in jdot b is expected to be approximately  down from the jdot  transactions  under fitchs aaasf scenario ce for the class a notes was able to withstand more than x the expected net loss rate stable origination underwriting and servicing jdcc has demonstrated strong capabilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its managed portfolio all securitizations issued and rated by fitch have performed within initial base case expectations integrity of legal structure the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to jdot b to increased cumulative net losses cnl over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and cnl showing a potential downgrade of one category under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario the notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating categories although still remaining investment grade under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in

rating drivers the affirmations of the class a notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with the current ratings as of the june  reporting period cumulative net losses totaled  basis points and as such the transaction is extrapolating below fitchs initial base case loss proxy the stable outlook for all classes reflects fitchs expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the transaction amortizes rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy which would impact available loss coverage lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to x and x higher of fitchs base case loss expectation initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the new issue report published aug   to date the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses within fitchs initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels as such continued strong performance for the transaction would most likely result in stable ratings conversely a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential

john deere born in rutland vermont usa on february   moved to grand detour illinois in  to escape bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define

began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell tractors under the waterloo boy name until  when the john deere model d was introduced the company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in waterloo

when to remove this template message deere  company began when john deere born in rutland vermont usa on february   moved to grand detour illinois in  to escape bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell tractors under the waterloo boy name until  when the john deere model d was introduced the company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in waterloo iowa namely the r r and r series the company produced its first combine harvester the john deere no  in  a year later this

john deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a  slope gradient on an episode of the travel channel series made in america that profiled deere  company host john ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from american farmers during the great depression during world war ii the greatgrandson of john deere charles deere wiman was president of the company but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the us

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which
