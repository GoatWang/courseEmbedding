improving the thermal performance of windows it creates a more comfortable indoor environment free from extreme temperatures and can reduce heating and cooling costs significantly insulating glass is ideal for buildings that require efficient climate control inherently insulating glass improves a window’s thermal performance by using an air space between two or more lites of glass to reduce the heat gain or loss the result is windows and doors that are more energy efficient and buildings that are more cost effective this type of glass can also reduce noise transmission our insulating glass units are double sealed using a primary polyisobutylene seal and a secondary silicone seal to ensure the sealed space remains dry throughout the unit’s lifetime the glass lites are separated by a desiccantfilled spacer the desiccant absorbs any internal moisture in the insulating glass unit curved laminated silkscreened and spandrel glass can all be insulated following this same process we can provide most any combination of finishes or properties needed by the customer tecnoglass offers multiple configurations of insulating glass units components when specifying insulating glass it is

reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two

these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive
