that the us initiate a bombing campaign against nicaragua and that the us do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the sandinista government the evidence developed by independent counsel did not warrant indictment of gates for his irancontra activities or his responses to official inquiriescitation needed gates was an early subject of independent counsels investigation but the investigation of gates intensified in the spring of  as part of a larger inquiry into the irancontra activities of cia officials this investigation received an additional impetus in may  when president george hw bush nominated gates to be director of central intelligence dci the chairman and vice chairman of the united states senate select committee on

first heard on october   from charles e allen the national intelligence officer who was closest to the iran initiative that proceeds from the iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the contras other evidence proves however that gates received a report on the diversion during the summer of  from ddi richard kerr the issue was whether the independent counsel could prove beyond a

counsels response nevertheless in order to answer questions about gates prior testimony independent counsel accelerated his investigation of gates in the summer of  this investigation was substantially completed by september   at which time independent counsel determined that gates irancontra activities and testimony did not warrant prosecution independent counsel made this decision subject to developments that could have warranted reopening his inquiry including testimony by clair e george the cias former deputy director for operations at the time independent counsel reached this decision the possibility remained that george could have provided information warranting reconsideration of gates status in the investigation george refused to cooperate with independent counsel and was indicted on september   george subpoenaed gates to testify as a defense witness at georges first trial in the summer of  but gates was never called the final report of the independent counsel for irancontra scandal issued on august   said that gates was close to many figures who played significant roles in the irancontra affair and was in a position to have known of their activities the

position as secretary of defense during his administration reportedly for at least the first year of obamas presidency gates was the fourteenth cabinet member in history to serve under two presidents of different parties and the first to do so as secretary of defense one of the first priorities under president barack obamas administration for gates was a review of us policy and strategy in afghanistan gates sixth in the presidential line of succession was selected as designated survivor during obamas inauguration on march   he told david gregory on meet the press that he would not commit to how long he would serve as secretary of defense but implied that he would not serve the entire first term while gates continued the troop withdrawals in iraq which already had begun in the bush administration he also implemented a rapid limited surge of troops in afghanistan in  robert gates removed general david d mckiernan from command in afghanistan on may   and replaced him with

forged a formidable partnership speaking frequently comparing notes before they go to the white house meeting with each other weekly and having lunch once a month at either the pentagon or the state department in a march  speech to a nato conference in washington secretary gates said that the demilitarization of europe—where large swaths of the general public and political class are averse to

department would lift its ban on women serving on submarines gates also prepared the armed forces for the repeal of the dont ask dont tell policy since the repeal in  homosexuals are able to serve in the military openly in service of that goal he announced in late march  the approval of new regulations that would make it more difficult to kick gays out of the military gates called the guideline changes which went into effect immediately a matter of common sense and common decency that would be an important improvement allowing the pentagon to apply current law in a fairer and more appropriate manner the pentagons legal counsel jeh johnson said the new regulations are by no means a moratorium on the current law and stressed that cases would move forward under the new standards gates sitting with obama biden and the us national security team gathered in the situation room to monitor the progress of operation neptune spear gates was photographed in the white house situation room photograph taken on may   by pete souza in august  speaking to foreign policy magazine secretary gates said that he would remain as secretary of defense until  and then retire i think that it would be a mistake to wait until january  he said this is not the kind of job you want to fill in the spring of an election year gates officially retired as secretary of defense on july   and was presented the presidential medal of freedom the nations highest civilian award by president obama during his retirement ceremony fiscal restraintedit gates tenure with the obama administration included a huge shift in military spending in april  gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the us department of defense  budget the budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare such as the end of new orders of the f raptor and further development of future combat systems manned vehicles however these cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces gates called this the nations first truly st century defense budget in late april  he suggested the navy cease funding development of a new multibilliondollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy he has suggested the hundreds of billions of dollars would be better spent on a new generation of vessels tailored to the threats and tactics more likely to be faced noting mark my words the navy and marine corps must be willing to reexamine and question basic assumptions in light of evolving technologies new threats and budget realities in a speech made on may   gates stated that he would make politically unpopular cuts to the pentagon bureaucracy in his future budgets the attacks of sept   opened a gusher of defense spending that nearly doubled the base budget over the last decade   military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer harsher scrutiny the gusher has been turned off and will stay off for a good period of time gates speaks to navy seal trainees nab coronado california  it was announced in august  that gates was trying to find  billion in defense savings through to  in order to instill a culture of savings and restraint in the military secretary gates said that it is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense gates said as a matter of principle and political reality the department of defense cannot expect americas elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job indeed everything possible to make every dollar count these cuts included the closing of the joint forces command the redundancy of fifty general and admirals and the removal of  senior civilian positions nato commentsedit on january   gates was quoted in the los angeles times as saying nato forces in southern afghanistan do not know how to properly combat a guerrilla insurgency and that could be contributing to rising violence in the country the netherlands and united kingdom protested in a june   speech in brussels before nato gates again stated that other nato members must do more as the united states tackles its budget deficit he said bluntly that in the past ive worried openly about nato turning into a twotiered alliance between members who specialize in soft humanitarian development peacekeeping and talking tasks and those conducting the hard combat missions between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments and those who enjoy the benefits of nato membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but dont want to share the risks and the costs this is no longer a hypothetical worry we are there today and it is unacceptable the blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the us congress—and in the american body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense nations apparently willing and eager for american taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in european defense budgets indeed if current trends in the decline of european defense capabilities are not halted and reversed future us political leaders—those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on americas investment in nato worth the cost post–obama administrationedit secretary of defense chuck hagel speaks with robert gates and leon panetta november  gates at

a question during the senate armed services committee hearing on december   as deputy director and director of americas leading intelligence agency for many years gates and his cia staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the soviet union more particularly gates has been criticized for allegedly concocting evidence to show that the soviet union was stronger than it actually was george shultz said that while secretary of state he felt the cia under gates was trying to manipulate him that the agency was a big powerful machine not under good control i distrust what comes out of it schultz also told gates at the time that his cia was usually wrong about moscow having dismissed gorbachevs policies as just another soviet attempt to deceive us in  stansfield turner former director of central intelligence described the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the soviet crisis … i never heard a suggestion from the cia … that numerous soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem turner said this failure was a consequence of deliberate distortion by those in the upper echelon of the cia who were helping to sell the reagan administrations defense buildup a view backed by former cia analyst melvin goodman at gates  confirmation hearings william casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the soviet threat … while gates role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence reviewing the third instalment of gates memoirs in  goodman said in my  years at the cia there was never the kind of toxic atmosphere that existed when gates served as deputy director for intelligence deputy director of cia and finally director of cia also according to newsweek gates as deputy director of cia allegedly vouched for the comprehensiveness of a cia study presented to the senate and president reagan alleging that the soviet union played a role in the  shooting of pope john paul ii a cia internal review later denounced the report as being skewed but that gates did not try to influence the reports conclusions shortly after his retirement from his tenure as defense secretary in summer  during a meeting of the national security council principals committee gates highlighted many of the measures taken by the us to advance israels security during the obama administration including providing access to state of the art weaponry assisting with the development of missiledefense systems and sharing highlevel intelligence before expressing his view that the us has received nothing in return from the israeli government with regards to the peace process according to senior us administration sources other officials present offered no rebuttal to gates analysis this was not the first

result of the fallout from the incident gates announced the removal of secretary of the army francis j harvey and later he approved the removal of army surgeon general kevin c kiley controversy over joint chiefsedit on june   gates announced that he would not recommend the renomination of peter pace the chairman of joint chiefs of staff due to anticipated difficulties with the confirmation process instead gates recommended mike mullen the chief of naval operations at the time to fill the position gates stated i am no stranger to contentious confirmations and i do not shrink from them however i have decided that at this moment in our history the nation our men and women in uniform and general pace himself would not be wellserved by a divisive ordeal in selecting the next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gates referred to pace as a friend and praised his service as a marine misshipments of nuclear weaponsedit on june   in response to the findings on air force misshipments of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons components gates announced the resignations of secretary of the air force michael wynne and air force chief of staff michael moseley gates would later write that the usaf was one of my biggest headaches during his time in the office obama administrationedit gates with israeli minister of defense ehud barak at the pentagon in  on december   presidentelect obama announced that robert gates would remain in his position as secretary of defense during his administration reportedly for at least the first year of obamas presidency gates was the fourteenth cabinet member in history to serve under two presidents of different parties and the first to do so as secretary of defense one of the first priorities under president barack obamas administration for gates was a review of us policy and strategy in afghanistan gates sixth in the presidential line of succession was selected as designated survivor during obamas inauguration on march   he told david gregory on meet the press that he would not commit to how long he would serve as secretary of defense but implied that he would not serve the entire first term while gates continued the troop withdrawals in iraq which already had begun in the bush administration he also implemented a rapid limited surge of troops in afghanistan in  robert gates removed general david d mckiernan from command in afghanistan on may   and replaced him with general stanley a mcchrystal the washington post called it a rare decision to remove a wartime commander the washington post described the replacement as one of several replacements of generals who represented the traditional army with generals who have pressed for the use of counterinsurgency tactics in december  gates visited afghanistan following president barack obamas announcement of the deployment of  additional personnel against the taliban insurgency gates with afghan president hamid karzai in march  time magazine notes that gates and us secretary of state hillary clinton have forged a formidable partnership speaking frequently comparing notes before they go to the white house meeting with each other weekly and having lunch once a month at either the pentagon or the state department in a march  speech to a nato conference in washington secretary gates said that the demilitarization of europe—where large swaths of the general public and political class are averse to military force and the risks that go with it—has gone from a blessing in the th century to an impediment to achieving real security and lasting peace in the st gates announced in february  that the department would lift its ban on women serving on submarines gates also prepared the armed forces for the repeal of the dont ask dont tell policy since the repeal in  homosexuals are able to serve in the military openly in service of that goal he announced in late march  the approval of new regulations that would make it more difficult to kick gays out of the military gates called the guideline changes which went into effect immediately a matter of common sense and common decency that would be an important improvement allowing the pentagon to apply current law in a fairer and more appropriate manner the pentagons legal counsel jeh johnson said the new regulations are by no means a moratorium on the current law and stressed that cases would move forward under the new standards gates sitting with obama biden and the us national security team gathered in the situation room to monitor the progress of operation neptune spear gates was photographed in the white house situation room photograph taken on may   by pete souza in august  speaking to foreign policy magazine secretary gates said that he would remain as secretary of defense until  and then retire i think that it would be a mistake to wait until january  he said this is not the kind of job you want to fill in the spring of an election year gates officially retired as secretary of defense on july   and was presented the presidential medal of freedom the nations highest civilian award by president obama during his retirement ceremony fiscal restraintedit gates tenure with the obama administration included a huge shift in military spending in april  gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the us department of defense  budget the budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare such as the end of new orders of the f raptor and further development of future combat systems manned vehicles however these cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces gates called this the nations first truly st century defense budget in late april  he suggested the navy cease funding development of a new multibilliondollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy he has suggested the hundreds of billions of dollars would be better spent on a new generation of vessels tailored to the threats and tactics more likely to be faced noting mark my words the navy and marine corps must be willing to reexamine and question basic assumptions in light of evolving technologies new threats and budget realities in a speech made on may   gates stated that he would make politically unpopular cuts to the pentagon bureaucracy in his future budgets the attacks of sept   opened a gusher of defense spending that nearly doubled the base budget over the last decade   military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer harsher scrutiny the gusher has been turned off and will stay off for a good period of time gates speaks to navy seal trainees nab coronado california  it was announced in august  that gates was trying to find  billion in defense savings through to  in order to instill a culture of savings and restraint in the military secretary gates said that it is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense gates said as a matter of principle and political reality the department of defense cannot expect americas elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job indeed everything possible to make every dollar count these cuts included the closing of the joint forces command the redundancy of fifty general and admirals and the removal of  senior civilian positions nato commentsedit on january   gates was quoted in the los angeles times as saying nato forces in southern afghanistan do not know how to properly combat a guerrilla insurgency and that could be contributing to rising violence in the country the netherlands and united kingdom protested in a june   speech in brussels before nato gates again stated that other nato members must do more as the united states tackles its budget deficit he said bluntly that in the past ive worried openly about nato turning into a twotiered alliance between members who specialize in soft humanitarian development peacekeeping and talking tasks and those conducting the hard combat missions between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments and those who enjoy the benefits of nato membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but dont want to share the risks and the costs this is no longer a hypothetical worry we are there today and it is unacceptable the blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the us congress—and in the american body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense nations apparently willing and eager for american taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in european defense budgets indeed if current trends in the decline of european defense capabilities are not halted and reversed future us political leaders—those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on americas investment in nato worth the cost post–obama administrationedit secretary of defense chuck hagel speaks with robert gates and leon panetta november

memoirs of a secretary at war gates alternately criticized and praised obamas military leadership writing i never doubted his support for the troops only his support for their mission in afghanistan

responds to a question during the senate armed services committee hearing on december   as deputy director and director of americas leading intelligence agency for many years gates and his cia staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the soviet union more particularly gates has been criticized for allegedly concocting evidence to show that the soviet union was stronger than it actually was george shultz said that while secretary of state he felt the cia under gates was trying to manipulate him that the agency was a big powerful machine not under good control i distrust what comes out of it schultz also told gates at the time that his cia was usually wrong about moscow having dismissed gorbachevs policies as just another soviet attempt to deceive us in  stansfield turner former director of central intelligence described the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the soviet crisis … i never heard a suggestion from the cia … that numerous soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem turner said this failure was a consequence of deliberate distortion by those in the upper echelon of the cia who were helping to sell the reagan administrations defense buildup a view backed by former cia analyst melvin goodman at gates  confirmation hearings william casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the soviet threat … while gates role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence reviewing the third instalment of gates memoirs in  goodman said in my  years at the cia there was never the kind of toxic atmosphere that existed when gates served as deputy director for intelligence deputy director of cia and finally director of cia also according to newsweek gates as deputy director of cia allegedly vouched for the comprehensiveness of a cia study presented to the senate and president reagan alleging that the soviet union played a role in the  shooting of pope john paul ii a cia internal review later denounced the report as being skewed but that gates did not try to influence the reports conclusions shortly after his retirement from his tenure as defense secretary in summer  during a meeting of the national security council principals committee gates highlighted many of the measures taken by the us to advance israels security during the obama administration including providing access to state of the art weaponry assisting with the development of missiledefense systems and sharing highlevel intelligence before expressing his view that the us has received nothing in return from the israeli government with regards to the peace process according to senior us administration sources other officials present offered no rebuttal to gates analysis this was not the first time gates publicly expressed frustration with the netanyahu government with which he had worked hard to provide widescale and deep military cooperation the likud party of israel responded

the iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the contras other evidence proves however that gates received a report on the diversion during the summer of  from ddi richard kerr the issue was

prosecution independent counsel made this decision subject to developments that could have warranted reopening his inquiry including testimony by clair e george the cias former deputy director for operations at the time independent counsel reached this decision the possibility remained that george could have provided information warranting reconsideration of gates status in the investigation george refused to cooperate with independent counsel and was indicted on september   george subpoenaed gates to testify as a defense witness at georges first trial in the summer of  but gates was

in  homosexuals are able to serve in the military openly in service of that goal he announced in late march  the approval of new regulations that would make it more difficult to kick gays out of the

on july   and was presented the presidential medal of freedom the nations highest civilian award by president obama during his retirement ceremony fiscal restraintedit gates tenure with the obama administration included a huge shift in military spending in april  gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the us department of defense  budget the budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare such as the end of new orders of the f raptor and further development of future combat systems manned vehicles however these cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces gates called this the nations first truly st century defense budget in late april  he suggested the navy cease funding development of a new multibilliondollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy he has suggested the hundreds of billions of dollars would be better spent on a new generation of vessels tailored to the threats and tactics more likely to be faced noting mark my words the navy and marine corps must be willing to reexamine and question basic assumptions in light of evolving technologies new threats and budget realities in a speech made on may   gates stated that he would make politically unpopular cuts to the pentagon bureaucracy in his future budgets the attacks of sept   opened a gusher of defense spending that nearly doubled the base budget over the last decade   military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer harsher scrutiny the gusher has been turned off and will stay off for a good period of time gates speaks to navy seal trainees nab coronado california  it was announced in august  that gates was trying to find  billion in defense savings through to  in order to instill a culture of savings and restraint in the military secretary gates said that it is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense gates said as a matter of principle and political reality the department of defense cannot expect americas elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job indeed everything possible to make every dollar count these cuts included the closing of the joint forces command the redundancy of fifty general and admirals and the removal of  senior civilian positions nato commentsedit on january   gates was quoted in the los angeles times as saying nato forces in southern afghanistan do not know how to properly combat a guerrilla insurgency and that could be contributing to rising violence in the country the netherlands and united kingdom protested in a june   speech in brussels before nato gates again stated that other nato members must do more as the united states tackles its budget deficit he said bluntly that in the past ive worried openly about nato turning into a twotiered alliance between members who specialize in soft humanitarian development peacekeeping and talking tasks and those conducting the hard combat missions between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments and those who enjoy the benefits of nato membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but dont want to share the risks and the costs this is no longer a hypothetical worry we are there today and it is unacceptable the blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the us congress—and in the american body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense nations apparently willing and eager for american taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in european defense budgets indeed if current trends in the decline of european defense capabilities are not halted and reversed future us political leaders—those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on americas investment in nato worth the cost post–obama administrationedit secretary of defense chuck hagel speaks with robert gates and leon panetta november

responds to a question during the senate armed services committee hearing on december   as deputy director and director of americas leading intelligence agency for many years gates and his cia staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the soviet union more particularly gates has been criticized for allegedly concocting evidence to show that the soviet union was stronger than it actually was george shultz said that while secretary of state he felt the cia under gates was trying to manipulate him that the agency was a big powerful machine not under good control i distrust what comes out of it schultz also told gates at the time that his cia was usually wrong about moscow having dismissed gorbachevs policies as just another soviet attempt to deceive us in  stansfield turner former director of central intelligence described the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the soviet crisis … i never heard a suggestion from the cia … that numerous soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem turner said this failure was a consequence of deliberate distortion by those in the upper echelon of the cia who were helping to sell the reagan administrations defense buildup a view backed by former cia analyst melvin goodman at gates  confirmation hearings william casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the soviet threat … while gates role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence reviewing the third instalment of gates memoirs in  goodman said in my  years at the cia there was never the kind of toxic atmosphere that existed when gates served as deputy director for intelligence deputy director of cia and finally director of cia also according to newsweek gates as deputy director of cia allegedly vouched for the comprehensiveness of a cia study presented to the senate and president reagan alleging that the soviet union played a role in the  shooting of pope john paul ii a cia internal review later denounced the report as being skewed but that gates did not try to influence the reports conclusions shortly after his retirement from his tenure as defense secretary in

including providing access to state of the art weaponry assisting with the development of missiledefense systems and sharing highlevel intelligence before expressing his view that the us has received

from april   through the remainder of gates tenure he served until  level of involvement in the irancontra scandaledit because of his senior status in the cia gates was close to many figures who played significant roles in the irancontra affair and was in a position to have known of their activities in  as deputy director of cia gates advocated that the us initiate a bombing campaign against nicaragua and that the us do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the sandinista government the evidence developed by independent counsel did not warrant indictment of gates for his irancontra activities or his responses to official inquiriescitation needed gates was an early subject of independent counsels investigation but the investigation of gates intensified in the spring of  as part of a larger inquiry into the irancontra activities of cia officials this investigation received an additional impetus in may  when president george hw bush nominated gates to be director of central intelligence dci the chairman and vice chairman of the united states senate select committee on intelligence ssci requested in a letter to the independent counsel on may   any information that would significantly bear on the fitness of gates for the cia post gates consistently testified that he first heard on october   from charles e allen the national intelligence officer who was closest to the iran initiative that proceeds from the iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the contras other evidence proves however that gates received a report on the diversion during the summer of  from ddi richard kerr the issue was whether the independent counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with allen in october president bush meets with robert gates general colin powell secretary dick cheney and others about the situation in the persian gulf and operation desert shield  january  grand jury secrecy rules hampered independent counsels response nevertheless in order to answer questions about gates prior testimony independent counsel accelerated his investigation of gates in the summer of  this investigation was substantially completed by september   at which time independent counsel determined that gates irancontra activities and testimony did not warrant prosecution independent counsel made this decision subject to developments that could have warranted reopening his inquiry including testimony by clair e george the cias former deputy director for operations at the time independent counsel reached this decision the possibility remained that george could have provided information warranting reconsideration of gates status in the investigation george refused to cooperate with independent counsel and was indicted on september   george subpoenaed gates to testify as a defense witness at georges first trial in the summer of  but gates was never called the final report of the independent counsel for irancontra scandal issued on august   said that gates was close to

ehud barak at the pentagon in  on december   presidentelect obama announced that robert gates would remain in his position as secretary of defense during his administration reportedly for at least the first year of obamas presidency gates was the fourteenth cabinet member in history to serve under two presidents of different parties and the first to do so as secretary of defense one of the first priorities under president barack obamas administration for gates was a review of us policy and strategy in afghanistan gates sixth in the presidential line of succession was selected as designated survivor during obamas inauguration on march   he told david gregory on meet the press that he would not commit to how long he would serve as secretary of defense but implied that he would not serve the entire first term while gates continued the troop withdrawals in iraq which already had begun in the bush administration he also implemented a rapid limited surge of troops in afghanistan in  robert gates removed general david d mckiernan from command in afghanistan on may   and replaced him with general stanley a mcchrystal the washington post called it a rare decision to remove a wartime commander the washington post described the replacement as one of several replacements of generals who represented the traditional army with generals who have pressed for the use of counterinsurgency tactics in december  gates visited afghanistan following president barack obamas announcement of the deployment of  additional personnel against the taliban insurgency gates with afghan president hamid karzai in march  time magazine notes that gates and us secretary of state hillary clinton have forged a formidable partnership speaking frequently comparing notes before they go to the white house meeting with each other weekly and having lunch once a month at either the pentagon or the state department in a march  speech to a nato conference in washington secretary gates said that the demilitarization of europe—where large swaths of the general public and political class are averse to military force and the risks that go with it—has gone from a blessing in the th century to an impediment to achieving real security and lasting peace in the st gates announced in february  that the department would lift its ban on women serving on submarines gates also prepared the armed forces for the repeal of the dont ask dont tell policy since the repeal in  homosexuals are able to serve in the military openly in service of that goal he announced in late march  the approval of new regulations that would make it more difficult to kick gays out of the military gates called the guideline changes which went into effect immediately a matter of common sense and common decency that would be an important improvement allowing the pentagon to apply current law in a fairer and more appropriate manner the pentagons legal counsel jeh johnson said the new regulations are by no means a moratorium on the current law and stressed that cases would move forward under the new standards gates sitting with obama biden and the us national security team gathered in the situation room to monitor the progress of operation neptune spear gates was photographed in the white house situation room photograph taken on may   by pete souza in august  speaking to foreign policy magazine secretary gates said that he would remain as secretary of defense until  and then retire i think that it would be a mistake to wait until january  he said this is not the kind of job you want to fill in the spring of an election year gates officially retired as secretary of defense on july   and was presented the presidential medal of freedom the nations highest civilian award by president obama during his retirement ceremony fiscal restraintedit gates tenure with the obama administration included a huge shift in military spending in april  gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the us department of defense  budget the budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare such as the end of new orders of the f raptor and further development of future combat systems manned vehicles however these cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces gates called this the nations first truly st century defense budget in late april  he suggested the navy cease funding development of a new multibilliondollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy he has suggested the hundreds of billions of dollars would be better spent on a new generation of vessels tailored to the threats and tactics more likely to be faced noting mark my words the navy and marine corps must be willing to reexamine and question basic assumptions in light of evolving technologies new threats and budget realities in a speech made on may   gates stated that he would make politically unpopular cuts to the pentagon bureaucracy in his future budgets the attacks of sept   opened a gusher of defense spending that nearly doubled the base budget over the last decade   military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer harsher scrutiny the gusher has been turned off and will stay off for a good period of time gates speaks to navy seal trainees nab coronado california  it was announced in august  that gates was trying to find  billion in defense savings through to  in order to instill a culture of savings and restraint in the military secretary gates said that it is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense gates said as a matter of principle and political reality the department of defense cannot expect americas elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job indeed everything possible to make every dollar count these cuts included the closing of the joint forces command the redundancy of fifty general and admirals and the removal of  senior civilian positions nato commentsedit on january   gates was quoted in the los angeles times as saying nato forces in southern afghanistan do not know how to properly combat a guerrilla insurgency and that could be contributing to rising violence in the country the netherlands and united kingdom protested in a june   speech in brussels before nato gates again stated that other nato members must do more as the united states tackles its budget deficit he said bluntly that in the past ive worried openly about nato turning into a twotiered alliance between members who specialize in soft humanitarian development peacekeeping and talking tasks and those conducting the hard combat missions between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments and those who enjoy the benefits of nato membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but dont want to share the risks and the costs this is no longer a hypothetical worry we are there today and it is unacceptable the blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the us congress—and in the american body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense nations apparently willing and eager for american taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in european defense budgets indeed if current trends in the decline of european defense capabilities are not halted and reversed future us political leaders—those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on americas investment in nato worth the cost post–obama administrationedit secretary of defense

americas leading intelligence agency for many years gates and his cia staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the soviet union more particularly gates has been criticized for allegedly concocting evidence to show that the soviet union was stronger than it actually was george shultz said that while secretary of state he felt the cia under gates was trying to manipulate him that the agency was a big powerful machine not under good control i distrust what comes out of it schultz also told gates at the time that his cia was usually wrong about moscow having dismissed gorbachevs policies as just another soviet attempt to deceive us in  stansfield turner former director of central intelligence described the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the soviet crisis … i never heard a suggestion from the cia … that numerous soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem turner said this failure was a consequence of deliberate distortion by those in the upper echelon of the cia who were helping to sell the reagan administrations defense buildup a view backed by former cia analyst melvin goodman at gates  confirmation hearings william casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the soviet threat … while gates role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence reviewing the third instalment of gates memoirs in  goodman said in my  years at the cia there was never the kind of toxic atmosphere that existed when gates served as deputy director for intelligence deputy director of cia and finally director of cia also according to newsweek gates as deputy director of cia allegedly vouched for the comprehensiveness of a cia study presented to the senate and president reagan alleging that the soviet union played a role in the  shooting of pope john paul ii a cia internal review later denounced the report as being skewed but that gates did not try to influence the reports conclusions shortly after his retirement from his tenure as defense secretary in summer  during a meeting of the national security council principals committee gates highlighted many of the measures taken by the us to advance israels security during the obama administration including providing access to state of the art weaponry assisting with the development of missiledefense systems and sharing highlevel intelligence before expressing his view that the us has received nothing in return from the israeli government with regards to the peace process according to senior us
