done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when

 precious metals oil  gas contrarianmarketplacethe gold bull portfoliosummaryi started buying shares of pembina pipeline in a roth ira earlier this year and i continue to buy morepembina pays a solid monthly dividend and yields close to  and theres a good chance dividends will grow in the future following an acquisitioni break down the value of pembinas stock and why holding the stock in a retirement account is recommended especially for us investorspembina pipeline why you should buy it in a roth ira pba data by ycharts pembina pipeline nysepba is a canadian petroleum and natural gas pipeline operator which recently announced a mega acquisition of competitor veresen in a  billion stock and cash deal with a dividend yield approaching  and a monthly dividend payout a lowrisk feebased business model with predictable cash flows and the potential for longterm dividend and earnings growth i think the stock is an excellent buy here and a particularly good fit for a roth ira heres what you need to know about pembina the company is a highyield stock with some impressive growth opportunities but it also operates a lowrisk business the stock has performed quite well over the past  years it has grown its dividend by  annually and paid  billion in dividends total shareholder returns are  on average with a  total return since  according to its corporate presentation last year pembina reported a record of  billion in adjusted ebitda and  in adjusted cash flow per share and has maintained a conservative balance sheet with x debtadjusted ebitda following the takeover of veresen the company is aiming for up to  to  billion in adjusted ebitda in  its enterprise value of  billion will place it right below enbridge nyseenb which carries a  billion enterprise value approximately  of its pembinas cash flows will come from feeforservice throughout  following the acquisition up from  this gives it more stable predictable cash flows pembina currently pays a monthly dividend of  per share and yields  however the company is planning an immediate  dividend increase upon closing of its transaction with veresen i think the buyout is a nobrainer the result will be a larger more diversified company with stronger cash flows and additional growth opportunities pembina estimates that its growth projects will increase by  billion to  billion with an additional  billion in unsecured growth opportunities according to its corporate presentation credit pembina presentation above is a highlight of the pro forma company estimates for  which shows it will be a more diversified company have a larger portion of its ebitda come from the united states and have slightly less counterparty exposure to noninvestmentgrade companies what does this all mean for pembinas earnings and cash flow the company is targeting  to  cash flow per share growth throughout  notice that this is pershare growth and not total growth as the company is looking to grow value on a pershare basis us investors should note that pembinas dividends are considered qualified dividends and are subject to canadian withholding tax however this tax can be avoided as of  canadian corporate dividends and interest income are exempt from this  withholding tax as long as the investment is held in an ira or k this is one reason im focused on adding pembina shares to my roth ira i expect solid longterm returns driven by the acquisition of veresen dividends should continue to grow at a pace of at least  per year if cash flow per share grows as planned holding shares in a roth allows investors to avoid paying any taxes or capital gains as long as you dont make withdrawals until youre   monthly payment of dividends also means the total returns will actually be better than if dividends were paid quarterly for example a  investment that earns  per year with monthly compounding ends up equally  after  years the same investment with the same exact returns compounded quarterly turns into  use this compound interest calculator to see for yourself in conclusion pembina pipeline is a solid dividendpaying stock which should only grow stronger following its takeover of rival veresen im expecting longterm average annual total returns of  to  including reinvested dividends i plan on buying more shares on future weakness along with phillips  nysepsx magellan nysemmp and
