has become a toptier life expense alongside other bigticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement however education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and homebuying—has become hampered in some families manage your wealth find a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near you enter zipcode go invalid zipcode some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education  at the same time children are entering their ’s with student loan debt which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes financial aid and many consumer goods and services it now costs on average  per year for tuition fees room and board for a fouryear private college assuming a collegecost inflation rate of  today’s yearold child may need  come college time in  “for parents the numberone goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement but close behind is paying for a child’s education” says marc dextraze executive director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in  it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many

profitolivia oran min readthe corporate logo of financial firm morgan stanley is pictured on the companys world headquarters in the manhattan borough of new york city january  mike segarnew york reuters  morgan stanley better known for underwriting bonds than for retail banking plans to offer savings accounts and certificates of deposits next year to wring more profit from its wealth management clients executives told reuters the bank has offered checking accounts and credit cards for years but it is launching more consumer banking products and giving brokers bonuses if clients use them the goal is to win more of the assets that customers keep at rivals such as jpmorgan chase  co or bank of america corp right now just  percent of morgan stanleys more than  million wealth management clients actively use its retail banking products you shouldnt have to deal with two or three financial institutions said eric heaton president of morgan stanley us banks in an interview with reuters just deal with us morgan stanley has no plans to build retail bank branches and will instead rely on its  brokers to sell the new products the effort may leave it looking a little more like a conventional bank a move that regulators have been encouraging since the crisis its chief rival goldman sachs group inc took a similar step in august when it agreed to buy general electric capital banks online deposit business the move is also likely to boost the bottom line  clients who actively use morgan stanleys banking products hold on average  percent more assets at the firm than those who dont the annual fees that customers pay are often based on a percentage of the clients assets at the firm that fee income tends to be relatively stable over time compared with many investment banking businesses the importance of stable results was driven home for the banks investors last month when it released third quarter earnings that showed revenue in its bond trading business plunging  percent excluding an accounting adjustment that investors often ignore while revenue in its wealth unit which includes brokerage fees interest income and other items fell just  percent morgan stanleys fee income and commissions have been falling since the beginning of  which the bank has made up for by generating more revenue from areas including lending after multibillion dollar trading losses brought morgan stanley uncomfortably close to failure during the financial crisis the bank agreed to buy citigroups smith barney business in pieces starting in  turning its retail brokerage business from being an afterthought into the source of about half the banks revenue goldman by contrast remains much more heavily reliant on bond trading stock underwriting and other traditional investment banking businesses to drive its bottom line investors seem to be siding with goldman sachs now  its shares trade at about  times their book value an accounting measure of their net value while morgan stanleys trade at about their book value lofty goal in addition to fee income banking products offer more deposit funding for morgan stanley which regulators view positively during a financial crisis depositors are less likely than corporate bond investors and other lenders to flee when trouble is brewing in markets or at a bank when rates rise deposit funding is often cheaper than other forms of borrowing morgan stanley now has around  billion of deposits in its bank unit and is aiming to get up to  billion in the next several years to help its effort it has assembled a team of card and payment executives many of who led similar businesses at merrill lynch tom duffy who heads banking services within wealth management says his product development team has more than doubled to around  since he joined the bank in morgan stanleys overall deposits at around  billion fund a much smaller portion of its balance sheet than most other banks  its deposits equal about  percent of assets compared with more than  percent for both jpmorgan chase and bank of america winning more client assets may not be easy analysts noted its a lofty goal to be the primary bank for every one of their wealth management clients said glenn schorr an analyst with evercore isi but even if the bank wins just a sliver of business from customers morgan stanley will be better off he said some financial advisers also question whether they will be able to push their clients who may prefer to conduct their everyday banking at a traditional bank branch into changing their daily behavior five or six years ago the whole banking effort at morgan stanley was very embryonic  we were playing catch up in the space said greg fleming morgan stanleys president of wealth management weve been gearing up for this over the last few years and building out our technology which is why this is more of a  initiative the technology fleming referred to includes online banking and mobile banking software boosting retail banking products will help to expand wealth managements profit margins last quarter the pretax margin in the wealth business rose to  percent at the lower end of the banks longterm goals and in line with bank of americas wealth unit over the same period in addition to adding executives to duffys product development team morgan stanley hired eight cash management specialists and sent them to  wealth management offices around the country earlier this year to train financial advisors and their support staff about the firms different cash management products it has also built up customer service teams of more than  representatives in salt lake city and columbus ohio and who answer clients questions about everyday banking this isnt the first time morgan stanley has dealt with retail products in the late s it merged with dean witter discover  company giving it a retail brokerage and a credit card business the bank spun off discover in  but morgan stanley never had a complete retail bank which hurt it between  and  when it bought the smith barney retail brokerage unit from citigroup it lost some top advisers during that period because it could not offer as many banking products as citigroup it began ramping up its lending business and views its latest push into retail banking products as the next step in its bringing its business more in line with bank of americas merrill lynch for example it still has ground to gain interest income at morgan stanleys wealth management unit in the third quarter was  million compared with  billion at bank of americas global wealth and investment management unit which includes merrill lynch wealth management us trust and related businesses reporting by olivia oran in new york editing by dan

alongside other bigticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement however education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and homebuying—has become hampered in some families manage your wealth find a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near you enter zipcode go invalid zipcode some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education  at the same time children are entering their ’s with student loan debt which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes

dextraze executive director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in  it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many s from some of the nation’s leading mutual
