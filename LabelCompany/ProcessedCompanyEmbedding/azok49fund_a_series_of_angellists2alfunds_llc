angellist deals will soon be private and other updates you’ll want to know earlier this week we sat down with naval ravikant cofounder of fiveyearold angellist a popular platform that matches startups with earlystage investors three million people including  accredited investors have created profiles on angellist since its founding and angellist now uses that information to pair startups with capital pair startup employees with employers and more newly pair startups with customers it’s become a big business as well as a confusing one ravikant readily admits and while we can’t report on one interesting new performancerelated wrinkle that’s coming soon he walked us through many other stats and initiatives our chat has been edited for length and clarity tc a few years ago angellist introduced syndicates essentially popup funds that allow angel investors to syndicate their investments in exchange for some upside it was fairly transparent at the outset but that’s been changing why nr seventyfive percent of the deals are now private up from  percent a year ago it’ll be default private soon because a lot of the hot deals tend to be private also that publicprivate dichotomy is always really hard for entrepreneurs in fundraising mode to figure out so they start associating our brand with a place to share information publicly to accredited investors which is a negative so they don’t want to go on here we might take a hit on liquidity by making the default private but at the end of the day it’s all about getting the highquality companies tc an investor gil penchina has built a big business on the platform are more leads starting to see a kind of of network effect nr gil is a unique case he’s the one who’s always breaking the system we’re more catering to operatorangels meaning people who have operating jobs or vps at big companies or who’ve started their own startups it’s people who aren’t professional vcs but who do four to six deals a year investing in alumni and people they know tc how many of them close a deal each month and are the investors on the platform mostly based in silicon valley nr we had  deals led by  leads close in june we had  deals led by  leads close in july the average for most leads on the platform is a couple of deals per year as for demographics i’d say over half the people who lead deals on the platform are in silicon valley tc you’d said publicly somewhere that you were getting into special purpose vehicles which come together quickly to invest in a single laterstage company why would someone create an spv on the platform more here naval ravikant on china money into silicon valley this trickle could become a tsunami angellist the online platform that matches startups with earlystage investors has grown by leaps and bounds since its  founding — and so have its ambitions in fact the company which already bills itself as both the biggest seedstage firm in the world and the world’s largest hiring platform for startups also aims to become the biggest venture fund in the world earlier this week we sat down with cofounder naval ravikant at the firm’s swanky new threestory digs in san francisco’s jackson square and as workmen shifted planks around the nearly completed groundfloor level ravikant caught us up to speed on a many aspects of what’s happening at angellist we’ll have more on his overarching vision tomorrow today we’re publishing a part of our conversation that centered one of the biggest drivers of angellist’s current growth the  million that csc group — one of the biggest private equity funds in china — committed to invest through angellist roughly  months ago the wsj billed it as the “largest single pool of funds devoted to earlystage startups—ever” ravikant shared how that relationship is evolving and why he thinks csc’s money is just the tip of the iceberg for both angellist and silicon valley more broadly our chat has been edited for length and clarity tc let’s start at the beginning who is managing this  million from csc nr it’s a fund called csc upshot that’s managed by csc’s veronica wu who used to be a vp at tesla motors in beijing ming yeh who’d spent the previous six years or so as a managing director at silicon valley bank in shanghai and tom cole a former partner at trinity ventures tc how much have they invested in startups on angellist so far nr they’re on track to invest between  million and  million this year with an average check size of  tc wow that’s quite a pace how does the decisionmaking process work nr we’ve built a dashboard for fund management and all these managers have signed nondisclosure agreements so they get to see literally hundreds and hundreds of deals on angellist and they chat with each other and with the lead investor’s approval if enough people vote yes the deal gets done much more here strictlyvc february   it’s friday does backflips cartwheels jumping jacks lunges —– top news in the am britain’s electronic spying agency in cooperation with the nsa reportedly hacked into the networks of the world’s largest sim card maker in order to eavesdrop on mobile phones worldwide the intercept

tribulations of entrepreneurship he also gave those gathered a comprehensive look at the nearterm future of angellist a fastmoving person san franciscobased company that’s perhaps become bestknown for its popup venture funds called syndicates that allow angel investors to syndicate investments themselves indeed according to ravikant more than  companies raised  million through the platform last year making angellist the “largest seed fund in the world” and angellist is hoping to double or triple those numbers this year more from our chat that evening edited for length here you say of the  million that your monthold syndicates program funneled toward startups last year  million or just less than  percent was from institutions are you happy with that number no laughs obviously institutional investors come later to the game they need more certainty more diligence it takes more time a few venture firms now actively use syndicates including foundry group which did something like  deals last year on your platform have you also talked with big mutual funds that now make big bets on laterstage startups and that might diversify even more by getting into earlierstage investing they have no idea what this is i’ve tried to explain it to them and it’s too bleeding edge for them sometimes we’re too far out ahead of the curve where are these angels coming from – the bay area primarily a lot of them are from the bay area a lot are entrepreneurs angels or maybe individual vc partners who are backing each other we also have hedge fund managers oil traders people in the finance industry who have made some money but aren’t in silicon valley there are definitely the dentists and radiologists who the finance industry seems to hate – i don’t know why and they do try and come on and we either reject them or we put them into a new series of index funds that are managed by us so they can invest in  startups at a time and hedge their bets you have syndicates you have these index funds and other products what do people use the most at angellist actually they mostly use the recruiting site which we started on a lark in early  when we noticed that people were raiding failed companies on angellist for employees that’s by far the highest activity thing on the site because everyone is looking to hire we have around  companies recruiting on angellist of whom more than  login every single week and go through     candidate profiles that are active are you ever going to make money off those listings that’s the obvious source of cash but it works because it’s free for the startups if we do monetize that — and we’re running some experiments — it will be at the high end for people who have more money than time last year angel investor gil penchina raised  million via syndicates to invest in beepi a used car marketplace alongside dst global was that the biggest syndicate to date by far we’ve had a couple of others that were over a million bucks it’s relatively constrained because you’re gathering checks from individuals so when you collect  million that’s  different checks and wire transfers and so on and we’re limited because we form a special purpose vehicle to invest in each company and that spv is limited to  unit holders by law so i would not extrapolate and say okay  million today tomorrow it will be  million then  million it’s fun to think it could go to that range but i don’t think so not yet penchina recently told the wsj that he has poured his entire life savings into angellist does that concern you what if things go south for him that might have been an exaggeration laughs but sure it’s never good when someone loses their shirt that’s true of any startup has anyone come after you over a deal that didn’t go as expected no in the entire history of angellist we’ve never had a single related case of fraud or a lawsuit threat we follow the rules we have a noaction letterfrom the sec we have disclaimers we’re trying to deal only with sophisticated people this is america and anyone can sue you and someone eventually will but so far so good how do you keep people from getting in over their heads we look at what angel investments they’ve done before and if they don’t have a history of doing them then we’ll run them through a questionnaire that asks them what percentage of your net worth are you putting in what kind of return do you expect how liquid do you think these investments are how big a basket of these do you think you need to assemble and based on their responses we’ll either reject them we’ll cap the amount they can invest or we’ll move them into one of the index funds and say “you can put a small amount in here” or we’ll say “go offline go to your local angel association and lose some money there then come back to us” the test we’re looking for is have you lost money before how much of someone’s net worth would you advise investing in nascent startups up to  percent no i would say anything more than  percent is probably silly obviously i’m personally far more leveraged than that – i’m “all in” on startups — but that’s because i’m living in silicon valley and i’ve bought into the dream

nearterm future of angellist his fastmoving person san franciscobased company that’s perhaps become bestknown for its popup venture funds called syndicates that allow angel investors to syndicate investments themselves indeed according to ravikant more than  companies raised  million through the platform last year making angellist the “largest seed fund in the world” and angellist is hoping to double or triple those numbers this year more from our chat that evening edited for length here you say of the  million that your monthold syndicates program funneled toward startups last year  million or just less than  percent was from institutions are you happy with that number no laughs obviously institutional investors come later to the game they need more certainty more diligence it takes more time a few venture firms now actively use syndicates including foundry group which did something like  deals last year on your platform have you also talked with big mutual funds that now make big bets on laterstage startups and that might diversify even more by getting into earlierstage investing they have no idea what this is i’ve tried to explain it to them and it’s too bleeding edge for them sometimes we’re too far out ahead of the curve where are these angels coming from – the bay area primarily a lot of them are from the bay area a lot are entrepreneurs angels or maybe individual vc partners who are backing each other we also have hedge fund managers oil traders people in the finance industry who have made some money but aren’t in silicon valley there are definitely the dentists and radiologists who the finance industry seems to hate – i don’t know why and they do try and come on and we either reject them or we put them into a new series of index funds that are managed by us so they can invest in  startups at a time and hedge their bets you have syndicates you have these index funds and other products what do people use the most at angellist actually they mostly use the recruiting site which we started on a lark in early  when we noticed that people were raiding failed companies on angellist for employees that’s by far the highest activity thing on the site because everyone is looking to hire we have around  companies recruiting on angellist of whom more than  login every single week and go through     candidate profiles that are active are you ever going to make money off those listings that’s the obvious source of cash but it works because it’s free for the startups if we do monetize that — and we’re running some experiments — it will be at the high end for people who have more money than time last year angel investor gil penchina raised  million via syndicates to invest in beepi a used car marketplace alongside dst global was that the biggest syndicate to date by far we’ve had a couple of others that were over a million bucks it’s relatively constrained because you’re gathering checks from individuals so when you collect  million that’s  different checks and wire transfers and so on and we’re limited because we form a special purpose vehicle to invest in each company and that spv is limited to  unit holders by law so i would not extrapolate and say okay  million today tomorrow it will be  million then  million it’s fun to think it could go to that range but i don’t think so not yet penchina recently told the wsj that he has poured his entire life savings into angellist does that concern you what if things go south for him that might have been an exaggeration laughs but sure it’s never good when someone loses their shirt that’s true of any startup has anyone come after you over a deal that didn’t go as expected no in the entire history of angellist we’ve never had a single related case of fraud or a lawsuit threat we follow the rules we have a noaction letter from the sec we have disclaimers we’re trying to deal only with sophisticated people this is america and anyone can sue you and someone eventually will but so far so good how do you keep people from getting in over their heads we look at what angel investments they’ve done before and if they don’t have a history of doing them then we’ll run them through a questionnaire that asks them what percentage of your net worth are you putting in what kind of return do you expect how liquid do you think these investments are how big a basket of these do you think you need to assemble and based on their responses we’ll either reject them we’ll cap the amount they can invest or we’ll move them into one of the index funds and say “you can put a small amount in here” or we’ll say “go offline go to your local angel association and lose some money there then come back to us” the test we’re looking for is have you lost money before how much of someone’s net worth would you advise investing in nascent startups up to  percent no i would say anything more than  percent is probably silly obviously i’m personally far more leveraged than that – i’m “all in” on startups — but that’s because i’m living in silicon valley and i’ve bought into the dream —– you talk a lot about the advantage of moving investing online people like to think that it doesn’t create that much value but we forget that when you move online there are all kinds of things you cannot do offline an example by the end of this year you’ll be able to go into syndicates and say “this person sourced the deal for me so i’m going to give this person carry this is passive capital so they’ll pay full freight the pro rata will get gobbled up by following entities” you can even start doing differential pricing you can establish that the first  into a deal gets a  percent discount and the next  gets a  percent discount it breaks that logjam of why should i be the first one to write a check into the company online would also seem to play into this notion of continuous fundraising or rolling closes do you think that’s a sustainable trend we’re going to see a lot more of it companies are getting much better at raising money whenever it’s available and they’ll raise it in dribs and drabs until they get to the scale or productmarket fit where a vc will come in and write a  million check i think it’s a natural trend and i do think it’s easier online than offline we already enable it to an extent in that syndicated deals can stay open for months and keep collecting capital if you want it to    my guess is that by the end of next year it’ll be a common thing in the past entrepreneurs had gotten a lot of advice from the venture side which was kind of talking their own book which was “get your ducks in a row and raise money once and get a good board member” it’s all good advice but it’s a little selfserving whereas accelerators give almost the opposite advice which is “go get the money right now get it from anyone who will write you a check within reason and keep taking money as long as you can and just don’t run out of cash” i’ve also seen you mention getting into secondaries how serious were you yes they’re becoming very popular now because household names like uber and airbnb and dropbox are staying private longer and people are running around trading in the companies’ stock on the side but it’s very tricky because secondaries are regulated in a very different way insider trading laws apply to secondaries the companies often don’t want there to be secondary trades so they have a right of first refusal a lot of the secondary trades that are going on are in violation of the companies’ bylaws a lot of them have counterparty risk where you don’t actually run it through the company you just get an iou from someone who could skip town a lot of this going on right now it’s possible that the amount of secondary trading going on in silicon valley under the covers is going to match the amount of primary financing soon and if you look at the public markets like the nasdaq or the nyse it’s almost all secondary the ipos are a tiny piece of the trades and then it’s all secondary trading going back and forth so it’s something that we’re looking at but it’s very difficult and because we’re so large and so watched we have to do it by the book we’re looking into it but it’s a hard problem update the original version of this story was titled “in silicon valley secondary deals quietly reaching ‘primary’ funding levels” ravikant asked that we change it given that our choice in wording was more predictive and certain than his original comments or intent our apologies to ravikant and to readers the rolling close here to stay or gone tomorrow venture capital was long a clubby opaque industry but angellist and crowdfunding are two intertwined innovations that have since knocked that model onto its side now another related twist looks poised to roil it again the rolling close you’ve probably heard the term in recent years a rolling close is what happens when a management team raises money within a certain window of time with no predetermined size for the “round” every amount invested is closed immediately at a set valuation versus a traditional funding where a round isn’t closed until a predetermined minimum is raised the messaging service snapchat is the highestprofile company to employ the model closing  million from  investors over the course of nine months last year last week as techcrunch reported an eightyearold londonbased film streaming service called mubi closed on  million in similar fashion raising the money from  investors over many months strictlyvc is aware of two startups in san francisco that are currently employing the same tactic you might think of it like crowdsourcing without the middleman “whoever wires the money is in and when you reach your target you ‘close’ the round” mubi founder efe cakarel told techcrunch ramana nanda an associate professor at harvard business school characterizes rolling closes as a product of a frothy market – full stop it’s an “effective strategy for entrepreneurs in industries and at times when capital for startups is abundant and financing risk is low” as long as firms and investors can reasonably expect to continue raising money on good terms nanda says they’re “less concerned about having a cash cushion in the event that things don’t go as well as expected or because investors will not show up when the cash reserve runs low” rolling closes are also tactical argues todd chaffee a managing director at institutional venture partners a snapchat investor that wrote its first check to the company in  “the formality of ‘let’s close this round get back to business and then raise another round” isn’t always ideal for a fastmoving company chaffee says calling rolling closes a “more fluid and dynamic approach” still there are downsides including — presumably — managing investor relations according to techcrunch sources snapchat ceo evan spiegel has been known to invite different parties to invest in snapchat at different premoney valuations techcrunch says some investors funded snapchat last year at a  billion valuation while others participated at a premoney valuation that was closer to  billion mubi’s backers invested at the same premoney valuation but all while the company’s postmoney valuation was rising meaning that every subsequent investor in mubi’s newest fundraise was getting less of the company for his or her money it was a “very transparent and fair process” says cakarel who tells strictlyvc that “new investors weighed mubi’s increased ‘premoney’ valuation against a company that was becoming better capitalized and that continued to grow its subscriber base significantly throughout the funding period” little wonder that investors who are accustomed to traditional rounds — where everyone receives the same terms — aren’t sure what to make of the trend “we haven’t seen this sort of financingclosing structure in the late stage” says paul madera of the latestage investment firm meritech capital but we “generally wouldn’t be very comfortable with it” he adds hunter walk cofounder of the seedstage firm homebrew says his firm has “occasionally participated” in rolling closes — in cases where the entrepreneurs are “herding cats a bit and want to put money to work right away from committed investors” at the same time he says “it would give me pause at the seed stage to see a founder who tried to mark up the company several times during a round” the big question of course is whether rolling closes are here to stay only time will tell but our guess is that they are — that they’re indicative of how private financings are moving toward a more marketbased approach after all if there’s more demand for an issue doesn’t it make sense to raise the price why should founders be forever bound to the artificial constraints of “rounds” as cakarel puts it “it was unimaginable even eight years ago when i started mubi to do a round of  million from a bunch of individuals each coming in with somewhere between  and  million in silicon valley” cakarel isn’t saying he’s closing the door on vcs “raising institutional capital is also very attractive and vcs can add a lot of value” but he notes that “vcs are no longer the only option you have for this kind of capital and this is good for entrepreneurs out of options come good decisions” sign up for our morning missive strictlyvc featuring all the venturerelated news you need to start you day at six months syndicates is maturing without some big names when angellist launched its “syndicates” program last september allthingsd anointed one investor kevin rose as its “million dollar man” the reason within a week of angellist making it possible for backers to put their money behind one individual rose collected more than  million in commitments rose a google ventures partner told his  backers that he planned to participate in five seed investments per year on the platform but six months later he hasn’t invested in any both mg siegler of google ventures and path cofounder dave morin who also quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of dollars to syndicate deals haven’t pulled the trigger on anything either neither google ventures nor morin responded to a request for comment but angellist cofounder naval ravikant has a theory based on his own investing experience “i think some investors assembled syndicates but didn’t know what to do with them i think some are scared because the platform is very transparent an investment is going to be tracked people will see the deal in detail there’s no hiding anything and it causes people to freeze up a bit” some have painted another picture of why rose may not be syndicating deals on the platform one source cites a low volume of highquality deals while another says that if there’s enough demand for a startup’s seed round there’s no reason to include a syndicate it seems entirely possible too that it’s harder for fulltime vcs to justify their involvement with the platform until it’s better understood google ventures as a single lp fund might also be struggling with whether to essentially create a separate management company around one of its partners perhaps unsurprisingly ravikant rejects each one of these ideas noting that both venture firms and lps are showing increased interest in syndicates including maiden lane a new fund backed institutional investors that will invest both directly in syndicates and in direct investment opportunities found elsewhere on angellist’s platform ravikant further insists the quality of the deals being syndicated is “actually quite good” he points to altschool a yearold san franciscobased company that’s creating a brandnew network of schools on tuesday the company announced that it has raised  million in series a funding led by founders fund and andreessen horowitz among altschool’s other earlier investors is former wikia ceo gil penchina who syndicated the investment on angellist ravikant also notes that syndicate leads can choose whether information about a deal will be made available to the general angellist investor community or to specific backers only suggesting that some of the program’s best startups are being funded under the radar he highlights ben davenport whose mobile messaging startup beluga was acquired by facebook and turned into facebook messenger davenport recently syndicated an investment in nybx a new yorkbased company focused on cryptocurrencies by design his backers are serious bitcoin investors only and “unless you were one of ben’s lps” says ravikant you didn’t see it i ask hunter walk of the venture firm homebrew about his experience with the platform last september his firm led a  million investment in the shipping startup shyp some of which came from a syndicate led by entrepreneurauthor tim ferriss it created a lot of press at the time for shyp but in retrospect was it worth it walk says it was “tim was able to assemble a great set of angels – some known some new to investing – but we saw his participation as strategic” angellist’s syndicates program is “still very much in beta so going slow” says ravikant “i don’t think the program will be hitting its stride until next year” in the meantime he says there’s “a lot more demand than we can run fundamentally something is working” with little notice seedstage valuations begin falling a widely held belief in silicon valley is that valuations are still on a oneway trajectory toward the sky with founders firmly in the driver’s seat but the reality for seedstage companies may be a bit more dire than that — and getting worse by the month according to the research firm cb insights both average and median seedstage valuations have fallen since last year with the average valuation dropping from  million to  million and median valuation falling even more precipitously from  million to just  million data from angellist a matchmaking service for investors and seedstage entrepreneurs also shows declining valuations according to angellist which tracks thousands of startups in its system the average seedfunded company’s valuation dropped from  million in the third quarter of  to  million in the third quarter of this year that isn’t a massive dip but angellist founder naval ravikant tells me that “by the time a shift in one direction shows up in the averages it’s pretty pronounced” a recent quarterly venture capital report out of pitchbook which operates a subscriptiononly database of private equity and vc deals paints a rosier picture pitchbook found that median premoney valuations for seedstage vcfunded companies have nearly doubled over the last three years — from  million in  to  million through the first three quarters of  still this same report observed that lofty valuations are only making it harder for companies to raise series a rounds pitchbook further noted that the rise of valuations can’t go on endlessly suggesting there will likely be more flat and down rounds in coming years ravikant — noting that “everyone’s dataset is incomplete” — suggests the future is now though he can’t pinpoint exactly when things began trending downward he thinks valuations “kind of peaked around the facebook ipo when it turned out to be less than people thought it would be” according to ravikant there “hasn’t been a mass exodus out” out of the seedstage investing market mainly because “people still believe some percentage of your portfolio should be earlystage but there’s increased recognition” that it’s a tough racket with many angels suffering from investor fatigue and suddenly becoming more realistic about the chances of their portfolio companies receiving followon investments there will always be a market for the most promising seedstage startups in other words but evidence from cb insights and angellist suggests that for entrepreneurs just setting out the road ahead looks bumpy sign up for our morning missive strictlyvc featuring all the venturerelated news you need to start you day angellist’s naval ravikant on his syndicates program two months in entrepreneurs naval ravikant and babak nivi have already done much to reshape the startup investing landscape with angellist their now fouryearold networking site that has largely replaced coffee meetings with internetbased matchmaking  in september angellist introduced another gamechanger — its syndicates program which allows angel investors to syndicate investments themselves work for which they receive carry an angel who syndicates a deal earns  percent of any upside while angellist collects  percent though syndicates is still nascent i caught up with ravikant yesterday afternoon to see who has begun using it and how it’s doing generally our chat has been edited for length can you give us a sense of the activity you’re seeing on syndicates i’d estimate that something like  million has moved through the platform already with several million more dollars committed but not yet closed about  deals have closed and others are in various stages of closing do the deals involve many of the same people or are you seeing fairly disparate groups a bit of both some people are using it more promiscuously to diversify their portfolio others are doing deals because the know the lead backer well and it’s a trust relationship for example you see path ceo and former facebook exec dave morin and other facebook alums coinvesting together and backing each other is anyone using the platform who you didn’t anticipate would the biggest surprise has been vc interest the response has been the highest from angels but we’re in advanced stages of talking about how to do syndicates with four firms and numerous others are using the platform as a way to scout out deals as with their scout programs they’re backing their portfolio ceos when those ceos go and find and fund great companies will we see a day when a person can raise  million via syndicates to invest across numerous startups the way it’s set up right now you can invest deal by deal…so we’ll hold funds in escrow for one deal what we’re not doing is managing a year commitment if google ventures partner kevin rose has  million in backing that’s  million for one deal but he can drop people or they can drop out of the syndicate any time has kevin rose made an investment through the platform yet  there are three google ventures partners who have a lot of syndicate backing but haven’t done a deal yet this whole thing seems like a great financial proposition for everyone but you is that true the idea isn’t to make money in the short term but yes today it’s a money loser we take  percent of any upside so if a lead invests  personally in a company then raises another  million off syndicates we get carry off that  million or  if the company sells for  million but most syndicates are in the  or  to  so at the lower end that’s about  for us meanwhile our outofpocket fees – to set up the funds handle customer accounting and so forth are  so we’re basically paying  for  in future profit why do it then because longer term we think we can bring llc costs down to  and as syndicate sizes grow it starts to become marginally profitable in the meantime are you quietly investing a fund for anyone right now at one point you were talking about doing that after you’d invested a  million angel fund hit forge i’ve been offered to raise another hit forge included stakes in uber twitter and stack overflow but investing is just a side hobby now and i’m making all my investments through syndicates i get to follow my best friends into deals and i don’t mind paying them for carry if it means i don’t have as many coffee meetings sign up for

andreessen horowitz how angellist syndicates could actually hurt some angels help some vcs the case for more transparency on angellist last week angellist the hugely popular platform that connects entrepreneurs with accredited investors introduced what many have heralded as a gamechanging new twist to its business called its syndicate program angellist now allows angel investors to syndicate investments themselves work for which they will receive carry an angel who syndicates a deal will earn  percent of any upside while angellist will collect  percent  if some of these syndicates involve the same groups of investors and those groups morph into venture funds don’t be surprised as some angels have said on social media since angellist announced its new program it might allow many of the “best” angels to strengthen their brands and potentially move up the investing food chain and there’s no reason why angels shouldn’t be able to extract more leverage from their investments particularly if they’re willing to manage a big syndicate or serve on a company’s board still while the syndicate program seems like a wellconsidered start angellist might think about providing some public accounting of the track records of its various syndicate leaders as the gossip site valleywag pointed out in its inimitable way yesterday without a structure that manages to disclose something about the investors’ irrs the program seems likely to degenerate into a popularity contest much of angellist’s matchmaking still rests on “social proof” which isn’t quite the same thing as cash on cash returns last week for example author and entrepreneur tim ferriss raised  for a logistics startup called shyp in  minutes ferriss’ fundraising prowess is impressive and nobody is prejudging shyp but it’s hard not to be skeptical about investments that are closed in less than an hour most vcs wouldn’t wish their fundraising process on their worst enemy but it does help them demonstrate their qualifications and commitment to the investment process to both their investors and their fellow partners through vetting their ppms with cambridge associates undergoing lengthy and arduous roadshows with family offices and pension funds and sacrificing a large amount of their own capital – typically  percent – in order to launch their funds venture investors let it all hang out yes there are toptier funds that are able to raise funds by picking up the phone a few times but that’s the exception not the norm by the time a firm has raised a fund they have left a trail of evidence testifying to the work they will put into an investment can the same be said of ferriss obviously angellist doesn’t need to replicate the venture business – it’s large enough as it is but in the interests of both entrepreneurs and the syndicates themselves it might be time for angellist to adopt an objective ratings process one that would provide everyone with more insight into an investor’s qualifications than just his or her klout score no doubt it would make an already promising initiative even better sign up for our morning missive strictlyvc featuring all the venturerelated news you
