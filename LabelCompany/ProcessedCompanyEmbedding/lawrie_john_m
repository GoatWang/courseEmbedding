woodsdirector john m lawrie  chairman  ceo at csc are you an employer spark of the corporate john m lawrie chairman  ceo csc a solid educational background almost three decades of work at one of the world’s leading technology pioneers and major – having progressed through various positions across myriad functions spanning several geographies and cultures followed by challenging leadership roles at relatively smaller enterprises as compared to the one he was long associated with make john michael lawrie the perfect example of how to revel in both conducive as well as notsoconducive working and business environmentswhile it seems like not such a great run so far with csc  he assumed the ceo position four years ago when the company – it can be said wasn’t doing any better— one can expect from the man with so much potential to turn things around one need look no further than his cv to understand his calibereducationlawrie did his mba from the drexel university philadelphia and also holds a ba in history from ohio universityprofessional careerof all the stints that lawrie has had so far his long association with technology major ibm stands out as that is where he seems to have both – added to his repertoire as well as delivered fantastically in multipositions spread over varied locations and contending or working with both customers and employees of many cultures and diversitieslawrie’s association started in  and for the next decadeandahalf or so he served in a variety of roles covering marketing financial and operational realms and did well enough to be considered for playing greater roles across other business functions throughout the globethe break toward leadership at ibm beginswhen he was made the general manager in  he was entrusted with handling the great lakes area us of ibm’s operations this acted as the stepping stone for lawrie and he made good of it and proved his worth in the next three years leading up to his elevation in  to the post of general manager of software ibm asia pacific he was based of tokyo japan and served in this capacity for a period of one yearthis was soon followed by him being entrusted with increased responsibility and areas to oversee thus aiding the inevitable  moving up the ranks slowly but ever so surely he was made general manager of industries ibm asia pacific – while still being stationed at tokyo japanback to the usafter successive year stints as general manager in asia – serving two vastly different business segments the management seems to have realized the potential that lawrie’s possessed acknowledging the same the company now brought him back to the us to make better use of his capabilities this happened in  when was tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the network computing division as its general managerwelltravelled and well honed…even as he about to complete a year with the network computing division there came yet another opportunity to showcase his improving leadership skills and the business acumen he had so manifested across multiple divisions this was as the general manager of ibm europe paris middleeast and africa – which included operations in  countries and  employees that was mammoth and lawrie proved his worth there as well for the next  years up until turn of the century and rolesthe new millennium brought along with it a whole new set of challenges as well as opportunities with it for ibm capable hands were the need of the hour especially those helming critical positions were like gold dust lawrie with his proven multicountry multicontinental experiences was right up thereaccordingly he would go on to become senior vice president and group executive of ibm global – which made him responsible for the worldwide sales and distribution of ibm products and services which role he assayed for the next three years until the end of his tenure at ibm – in breakingawayhaving served in very senior positions at ibm time was ripe for him to ascend to the top position of a company and prove to the world of his mettle at the opportune moment in  he joined siebel systems inc now part of the oracle corporation – the internationally renowned software and related solutions company as its chief executive officerthen came another opportunity to put to use all his skills capabilities and leadership qualities with a private investment firm called valueactcapital based of san francisco as a general partner – which stint lased for one year up to at it againbarring this brief digression from the it field lawrie’s entire career has been in the technology side after valueact it was back to the information technology realm when he served for two years as the executive chairman of all scriptsmisys healthcare solutions inc – a healthcare it solutions company deriving from all the experience he had gained lawrie proved to be instrumental in several strategic mergers that helped the company became one of the leading players in the industryon the back of his brief stint with valueact capital as indeed the undoubted it industry experience he now assumed the leadership position as the ukbased software solutions company called misys plc which primarily served the financial services industry he helped the company grow through significant revenue growth and several other factors that augured well for the company as well as himselfincreased top line growth coming on the heels of client satisfaction improved operational margins and appreciable returns to the company’s shareholders helped in not only cementing the company’s position in the market but it also facilitated lawrie’s move to his current company csc which he joined as a member on the board of directors in early at csca month later lawrie was made the ceo of the company with the aim of utilizing his proven experience in revitalizing complex global companies to deliver increased shareholder value by driving operational excellence clientcentric strategies and championing innovationin due course around end lawrie also became the chairman of the board of directors of the company which role would likely allow him to exercise more control over the company strategy and the way forward it is too early to say whether he will make fruitful use of the mandate he possesses perhaps it is best left for time to decide whether or not it was the right decisionfor his part though he has been proactively working towards helping the company in keeping pace with contemporaries as well as taking company’s services and offerings to the next
