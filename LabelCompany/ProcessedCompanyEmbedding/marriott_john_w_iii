ceremonial gold rope to unveil a model of the hotel chains new room design in new yorks times square on sept  by richard drew  associated press toolbox resize print email reprints by michael s rosenwald washington post staff writer saturday october   john w marriott iii said yesterday that he is leaving the company that his family built from a washington dc root beer stand into a global food and hotel empire the apparent start of a transition away from daytoday family control of one of the regions most prominent corporations as the middle son of marriott internationals chairman and chief executive jw bill marriott jr he had been a leading candidate to take over the firm when his father  retires but word that he will leave the bethesda company in january seemed to confirm what many marriottwatchers have long suspected executive control of the worlds largest hotel chain will pass from the family that built the company this clearly indicates that someone other than a family member will likely be the next chief executive said william c marks an analyst with jmp securities the focus now he said is on two longtime executives arne m sorenson the chief financial officer and william j shaw the president marriotts deep roots in the regions business community date back to when washington was mostly a onecompany town  a government town though that has largely changed through the years with dozens of hightech startups and government contractors producing a bevy of millionaires marriotts presence has been a constant with the family playing major roles in the civic and philanthropic worlds bill marriott has been a member of the federal city council an influential civic organization focused on development in the district for decades the company has supported local causes such as the marriott hospitality public charter high school a district public school that prepares high school students for careers in the hotel business sorenson also has ties to washington before joining marriott he was a washingtonbased partner with law firm latham  watkins john w marriott iii  joined the family business in  four years after his father took over as chief executive as executive vice president of lodging he had been credited recently with reviving the firms  different brands  from the moderately priced fairfield inn to the extravagant ritzcarlton while the announcement appears to take john marriott out of the running to control the company he was promoted to vice chairman of the board of directors suggesting the family would continue to wield influence in the firms operations the family controls  percent of company stock john marriott outranked his brothers stephen and david on the corporate ladder in the company their grandparents founded in  on th street nw the root beer stand led to the hot shoppes restaurant chain followed by roy rogers and big boy the family opened their first hotel in arlington in  today the company has  employees   locally  and more than  billion a year in revenue with that kind of money at stake particularly in a familyrun business questions of succession become complicated the media conglomerate murdoch family is wrestling with similar issues with rupert murdochs oldest son lachlan recently leaving the family business though bill marriott and the company strongly maintain that he has no plans to step aside anytime soon that hasnt stopped speculation both inside and outside of the firm about who will one day take over the focus in part had naturally been on a family member which is not surprising to anyone familiar with bill marriotts persona as a folksy devout mormon a tough businessman who also cares deeply about family life and values though john marriott is known to be more introverted than his father he is clearly trusted with the familys fortune he founded jwm family enterprises a private investment partnership with more than  million in assets he will become the organizations chief executive john marriotts position as a possible successor to his father was largely a function of family circumstances his brother david senior vice president of global and field sales is only  years old and not fully groomed as a top executive his older brother stephen a senior vice president of culture and special events has a hearing and vision impairment that developed when he was a teenager and has progressed their sister debbie does not work in the business though her husband ron harrison is in charge of canadian operations john marriott and his father were not available for comment yesterday company officials said however charlotte sterling executive vice president of communications said that the companys board has always felt very strongly that the right person should lead the
