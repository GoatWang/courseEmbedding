yale university research interests  job description • sugar metabolism and sensing in plants • the effect of sugars on stomata and plant water management• the connection between sugar sensing and regulation of stomata photosynthesis and transpiration • xylem development and water transport brief description of research activitiessugars are the primary products of plants and affect almost every aspect of plant development the lab is studying how sugars affect plant development and physiology we focus on the initial central sugar metabolism genes hexokinases hxks and fructokinases frkswe isolated hxk and frk genes and determined their biochemical characteristics and intracellular localizationthe role of each of the hxk and frk isozymes is explored by the use of sense and antisense transgenic plantsin contrast to a  years old hypothesis that sugars open stomata we discovered recently that sugars close stomata and they do it via hxk based on this discovery we developed a method registered as a patent to create plants that save wateranother major topic in the lab is the connection between sugar metabolism and vascular development we found that specific frks play major roles in xylem and phloem developmentmore recently we discovered a new connection between sugar levels and plant water management publication listpublications        kassir y granot d and simchen g
