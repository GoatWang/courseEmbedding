peter galuszka moneywatch october    am national citys demise owes much to greedy ceos comment share tweet stumble email last updated oct    am edt national city bank survived the civil war the great depression the world wars and the demise and comeback of cleveland but it couldnt withstand the decisions made over the past decade by its ceos who stand to gain millions in golden parachutes once a solid trusted bank national city saw its stock tumble and big layoffs of its workforce over the past year last week after the federal government officials said they wouldnt include it in its bailout program the bank agreed to be bought by pnc finanical group of pittsburgh thats a special irony since the cleveland browns nfl team and pittsburgh steelers are bitter rivals what got national city into such a mess was the aggressive move into mortgages led by former ceo david daberko i had covered national city and had interviewed daberko many times in the late s back then he seemed a visionary and wanted to turn profitable national city into a mortgage juggernaut these were the late clinton admnistration years when the economy was booming the internet craze was in full swing and the future looked very very bright national city hadnt dealt much with mortgages but daberko got the subprime bug he bought californiabased first franklin for  million in  soon half of national citys profits were coming from mortgages curiously pnc which is to buy national city dumped mortgages back in  believing them to be too risky but daberko looked smarter still when he sold first franklin in  for  billion to merril lynch but the bank still had a pile of risky loans the stars started falling and the bank didnt notice until it was too late daberko retired from national city late last year with a  million payout although much of that has since been reduced following the dramatic tanking of the banks stock prices new ceo peter raskind took over incredibly he was telling reporters as recently as oct  that he was optimistic about the banks future raskind makes about  million in total annual compensation and it isnt clear what his payout will be when pnc takes over probably by the first of next year meanwhile plenty of national city employees are being laid off a total of one third may be gone with the merger and loyal company retirees have seen their  ks devastated this post first appeared
