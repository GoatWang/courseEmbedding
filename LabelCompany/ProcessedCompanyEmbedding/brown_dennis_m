with his parents three elder brothers and a sister although his mother died in the s he began his singing career at the age of nine while still at junior school with an endofterm concert the first time he performed in public although he had been keen on music from an even earlier age and as a youngster was a keen fan of american balladeers such as brook benton sam cooke frank sinatra and dean martin he cited nat king cole as one of his greatest early influences he regularly hung around jjs record store on orange street in the rocksteady era and his relatives and neighbours would often throw brown pennies to hear him sing in their yard browns first professional appearance came at the age of eleven when he visited a local club where his brother basil was performing a comedy routine and where he made a guest appearance with the clubs resident group the fabulous falcons a group that included cynthia richards david scotty scott and noel brown on the strength of this performance he was asked to join the group as a featured vocalist when the group performed at a jlp conference at the national arena brown sang two songs  desmond dekkers unity and johnnie taylors aint that loving you  and after the audience showered the stage with money he was able to buy his first suit with the proceeds bandleader byron lee performed on the same bill and was sufficiently impressed with brown to book him to perform on package shows featuring visiting us artists where he was billed as the boy wonder as a young singer brown was influenced by older contemporaries such as delroy wilson whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing errol dunkley john holt ken boothe and bob andy browns first recording was an original song called lips of wine for producer derrick harriott but when this was not released he recorded for clement coxsone dodds studio one label and his first session yielded the single no man is an island recorded when brown was aged twelve and released in late  the single received steadily increasing airplay for almost a year before becoming a huge hit throughout jamaica brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for dodd amounting to around thirty songs and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists including providing harmonies along with horace andy and larry marshall on alton elliss sunday coming album brown was advised by fellow studio one artist ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting and after convincing dodd to buy him an instrument was taught the basics by ellis these studio one recordings were collected on two albums no man is an island and if i follow my heart the title track penned by alton ellis although brown had left studio one before either was released he went on to record for several producers including lloyd daley baby dont do it and things in life prince buster one day soon and if i had the world and phil pratt black magic woman let love in and what about the half before returning to work with derrick harriott recording a string of popular singles including silhouettes concentration he cant spell and musical heatwave with the pick of these tracks collected on the super reggae and soul hits album in  brown also recorded for vincent randy chin cheater dennis alcapone i was lonely and herman chin loy its too late and song my mother used to sing among others with brown still at school at this stage of his career international successedit in  brown began an association that would result in his breakthrough as an internationally successful artist he was asked by joe gibbs to record an album for him and one of the tracks recorded as a result money in my pocket was a hit with uk reggae audiences and quickly became a favourite of his live performances this original version of money in my pocket was in fact produced by winston niney holness on behalf of gibbs with musical backing from the soul syndicate in the same year brown performed as part of a christmas morning showcase in toronto ontario canada along with delroy wilson scotty errol dunkley and the fabulous flames where he was billed as the boy wonder of jamaica and was considered the star of the show in a local newspaper review the songs popularity in the uk was further cemented with the release of a deejay version aso we stay money in hand credited to big youth and dennis brown which outsold the original single and topped the jamaican singles chart brown and holness became close even sharing a house in pembroke hall brown followed this with another collaboration with holness on westbound train which was the biggest jamaican hit of summer  and browns star status was confirmed when he was voted jamaicas top male vocalist in a poll by swing magazine the same year brown followed this success with cassandra and no more will i roam and tracks such as africa and love jah displaying browns rastafari beliefs became staples on londons sound system scene in  brown was hospitalized due to fatigue caused by overwork although at the time rumours spread that he only had one lung and had only a week to live or had contracted tuberculosis he was advised to take an extended break from performing and concentrated instead on his college studies brown returned to music and toured the united kingdom for the first time in late summer  as part of a jamaican showcase along with cynthia richards al brown sharon forrester and the maytals after which he was invited to stay on for further dates where he was backed by the cimarons staying in the uk for another three months while in the uk he recorded for the first time since his hospitalization working with producer sydney crooks and again backed by the cimarons while brown was in the uk gibbs released an album collecting recordings made earlier in jamaica released as the best of dennis brown and browns first single to get a proper uk release was issued on the synda label  no more will i roam he returned to jamaica for christmas but six weeks later was back in the uk now with holness in tow as his business manager to negotiate a record deal with trojan records the first brown album to be released as a result being just dennis although the pair would be left out of pocket after trojans collapse and subsequent buyout by saga records on their return to jamaica brown and holness resumed recording in earnest with tracks for a new album including so long rastafari boasting and open the gate during  brown also recorded oneoff sessions for sonia pottinger if you leave me and bunny lee so much pain a duet with johnny clarke and the first recordings began to appear on browns new deb music label in the wake of the trojan collapse brown and holness arranged a deal with local independent label owners castro brown who ran morpheus records and larry lawrence ethnic fight to distribute their releases in the uk brown saw the uk as the most important market to target and performed for five consecutive nights at the georgian club in croydon to raise funds to start his new deb music label with castro brown in early  castro secured a deal with radio london disc jockey charlie gillett for morpheus and hence deb output to be issued through the latters oval records which had a distribution deal with virgin records but after a dispute over castros separate supply of these records to london record shops the deal was scrapped and the early deb releases suffered from a lack of promotion later that year brown voiced two tracks at lee scratch perrys black ark studio take a trip to zion and wolf and leopard the latter of which was a hit in jamaica and would prove to be one of browns most popular songs with a lyric criticizing those criminals who rode the natty dread bandwagon brown confirmed in an interview in black echoes that he had parted company with holness stating i was going along with one mans ideas for too long niney was trying to find a new beat at all times which was disconcerting so i hadnt been working with my true abilities now i know that i can produce myself brown began working again with joe gibbs with an agreement that in return for studio time for his own productions brown would allow gibbs use of any rhythm recorded in the process the first album from this arrangement the  release visions of dennis brown gave him his biggest success so far blending conscious themes and love songs and confirming browns transformation from child star to grown up artist the biblicalthemed sleeve and portrait of haile selassie on the back complemented the roots reggae tracks on the album including repatriation jah can do it and cover versions of earl s malcolm x and clive hunts milk and honey the album immediately entered the black echoes chart and stayed there well into the following year although it was only available in the uk as an expensive import visions was voted reggae album of the year by melody maker writers and was given the same award by readers of black echoes a reissued wolf and leopard single and the eventual album release of the same name also sold well in the uk both topping the black echoes chart brown toured the uk in autumn  with big youth and described the tour its like i was appointed to deliver certain messages and now is the time to deliver them he had also begun producing recordings by his protege junior delgado in  brown moved to live in london and set up premises in battersea rise near clapham junction to relaunch the deb music label with castro brown with artists featured on the label including junior delgado  bob andy lennox brown and later gregory isaacs brown had further success himself with a discomix of how could i leave you a version of the sharks rocksteady standard how could i live with accompanying toast by prince mohamed in march  brown flew to jamaica where he was booked at the last minute to perform at the one love peace concert at the national arena backed by lloyd parks we the people band visions of dennis

single was first released initially released as a discomix featuring a new version of money in my pocket and the deejay version cool runnings by price mohamed which became unavailable for a time after quickly selling out its first pressing this single gave brown his first uk top  hit reaching number  the following year and becoming one of the biggest international hits in jamaicas history after crossing over first into soul clubs and then rock clubs this success led to brown featuring on the cover of the nme in february  browns next two albums were both released on deb  so long rastafari and josephs coat of many colours although the label was closed down in  after which brown again did the rounds of jamaicas top producers as well as continuing selfproductions with singles such as the

been keen on music from an even earlier age and as a youngster was a keen fan of american balladeers such as brook benton sam cooke frank sinatra and dean martin he cited nat king cole as one of his greatest early influences he regularly hung around jjs record store on orange street in the rocksteady era and his relatives and neighbours would often throw brown pennies to hear him sing in their yard browns first professional appearance came at the age of eleven when he visited a local club where his brother basil was performing a comedy routine and where he made a guest appearance with the clubs resident group the fabulous falcons a group that included cynthia richards david scotty scott and noel brown on the strength of this performance he was asked to join the group as a featured

canada along with delroy wilson scotty errol dunkley and the fabulous flames where he was billed as the boy wonder of jamaica and was considered the star of the show in a local newspaper review the songs popularity in the uk was further cemented with the release of a deejay version aso we stay money in hand credited to big youth and dennis brown which outsold the original single and topped the jamaican singles chart brown and holness became close even sharing a house in pembroke hall brown followed this with another collaboration with holness on westbound train which was the biggest

croydon to raise funds to start his new deb music label with castro brown in early  castro secured a deal with radio london disc jockey charlie gillett for morpheus and hence deb output to be issued through the latters oval records which had a distribution deal with virgin records but after a dispute over castros separate supply of these records to london record shops the deal was scrapped and the early deb releases suffered from a lack of promotion later that year brown voiced two tracks at lee scratch perrys black ark studio take a trip to zion and wolf and leopard the latter of which was a hit in jamaica and would prove to be one of browns most popular songs with a lyric criticizing those criminals who rode the natty dread bandwagon brown confirmed in an interview in black echoes that he had parted company with holness stating i was going along with one mans ideas for too long niney was trying to find a new beat at all times which was disconcerting so i hadnt been working with my true abilities now i know that i can produce myself brown began working again with joe gibbs with an agreement that in return for studio time for his own productions brown would allow gibbs use of any rhythm recorded in the process the first album from this arrangement the  release visions of dennis brown gave him his biggest success so far blending conscious themes and love songs and confirming

actor and journalist and he grew up in a large tenement yard between north street and king street in kingston with his parents three elder brothers and a sister although his mother died in the s he began his singing career at the age of nine while still at junior school with an endofterm concert the first time he performed in public although he had been keen on music from an even earlier age and as a youngster was a keen fan of american balladeers such as brook benton sam cooke frank sinatra and dean martin he cited nat king cole as one of his greatest early influences he regularly hung around jjs record store on orange street in the rocksteady era and his relatives and neighbours would often throw brown pennies to hear him sing in their yard browns first professional appearance came at the age of eleven when he visited a local club where his brother basil was performing a comedy routine and where he made a guest appearance with the clubs resident group the fabulous falcons a group that included cynthia richards david scotty scott and noel brown on the strength of this performance he was asked to join the group as a featured vocalist when the group performed at a jlp conference at the national arena brown sang two songs  desmond dekkers unity and johnnie taylors aint that loving you  and after the audience showered the stage with money he was able to buy his first suit with the proceeds bandleader byron lee performed on the same bill and was sufficiently impressed with brown to book him to perform on package shows featuring visiting us artists where he was billed as the boy wonder as a young singer brown was influenced by older contemporaries such as delroy wilson whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing errol dunkley john holt ken boothe and bob andy browns first recording was an original song called lips of wine for producer derrick harriott but when this was not released he recorded for clement coxsone dodds studio one label and his first session yielded the single no man is an island recorded when brown was aged twelve and released in late  the single received steadily increasing airplay for almost a year before becoming a huge hit throughout jamaica brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for dodd amounting to around thirty songs and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists including providing harmonies along with horace andy and larry marshall on alton elliss sunday coming album brown was advised by fellow studio one artist ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting and after convincing dodd to buy him an instrument was taught the basics by ellis these studio one recordings were collected on two albums no man is an island and if i follow my heart the title track penned by alton ellis although brown had left studio one before either was released he went on to record for several producers including lloyd daley baby dont do it and things in life prince buster one day soon and if i had the world and phil pratt black magic woman let love in and what about the half before returning to work with derrick harriott recording a string of popular singles including silhouettes concentration he cant spell and musical heatwave with the pick of these tracks collected on the super reggae and soul hits album in  brown also recorded for vincent randy chin cheater dennis alcapone i was lonely and herman chin loy its too late and song my mother used to sing among others with brown still at school at this stage of his career international successedit in  brown began an association that would result in his breakthrough as an internationally successful artist he was asked by joe gibbs to record an album for him and one of the tracks recorded as a result money in my pocket was a hit with uk reggae audiences and quickly became a favourite of his live performances this original version of money in my pocket was in fact produced by winston niney holness on behalf of gibbs with musical backing from the soul syndicate in the same year brown performed as part of a christmas morning showcase in toronto ontario canada along with delroy wilson scotty errol dunkley and the fabulous flames where he was billed as the boy wonder of jamaica and was considered the star of the show in a local newspaper review the songs popularity in the uk was further cemented with the release of a deejay version aso we stay money in hand credited to big youth and dennis brown which outsold the original single and topped the jamaican singles chart brown and holness became close even sharing a house in pembroke hall brown followed this with another collaboration with holness on westbound train which was the biggest jamaican hit of summer  and browns star status was confirmed when he was voted jamaicas top male vocalist in a poll by swing magazine the same year brown followed this success with cassandra and no more will i roam and tracks such as africa and love jah displaying browns rastafari beliefs became staples on londons sound system scene in  brown was hospitalized due to fatigue caused by overwork although at the time rumours spread that he only had one lung and had only a week to live or had contracted tuberculosis he was advised to take an extended break from performing and concentrated instead on his college studies brown returned to music and toured the united kingdom for the first time in late summer  as part of a jamaican showcase along with cynthia richards al brown sharon forrester and the maytals after which he was invited to stay on for further dates where he was backed by the cimarons staying in the uk for another three months while in the uk he recorded for the first time since his hospitalization working with producer sydney crooks and again backed by the cimarons while brown was in the uk gibbs released an album collecting recordings made earlier in jamaica released as the best of dennis brown and browns first single to get a proper uk release was issued on the synda label  no more will i roam he returned to jamaica for christmas but six weeks later was back in the uk now with holness in tow as his business manager to negotiate a record deal with trojan records the first brown album to be released as a result being just dennis although the pair would be left out of pocket after trojans collapse and subsequent buyout by saga records on their return to jamaica brown and holness resumed recording in earnest with tracks for a new album including so long rastafari boasting and open the gate during  brown also recorded oneoff sessions for sonia pottinger if you leave me and bunny lee so much pain a duet with johnny clarke and the first recordings began to appear on browns new deb music label in the wake of the trojan collapse brown and holness arranged a deal with local independent label owners castro brown who ran morpheus records and larry lawrence ethnic fight to distribute their releases in the uk brown saw the uk as the most important market to target and performed for five consecutive nights at the georgian club in croydon to raise funds to start his new deb music label with castro brown in early  castro secured a deal with radio london disc jockey charlie gillett for morpheus and hence deb output to be issued through the latters oval records which had a distribution deal with virgin records but after a dispute over castros separate supply of these records to london record shops the deal was scrapped and the early deb releases suffered from a lack of promotion later that year brown voiced two tracks at lee scratch perrys black ark studio take a trip to zion and wolf and leopard the latter of which was a hit in jamaica and would prove to be one of browns most popular songs with a lyric criticizing those criminals who rode the natty dread bandwagon brown confirmed in an interview in black echoes that he had parted company with holness stating i was going along with one mans ideas for too long niney was trying to find a new beat at all times which was disconcerting so i hadnt been working with my true abilities now i know that i can produce myself brown began working again with joe gibbs with an agreement that in return for studio time for his own productions brown would allow gibbs use of any rhythm recorded in the process the first album from this arrangement the  release visions of dennis brown gave him his biggest success so far blending conscious themes and love songs and confirming browns transformation from child star to grown up artist the biblicalthemed sleeve and portrait of haile selassie on the back complemented the roots reggae tracks on the album including repatriation jah can do it and cover versions of earl s malcolm x and clive hunts milk and honey the album immediately entered the black echoes chart and stayed there well into the following year although it was only available in the uk as an expensive import visions was voted reggae album of the year by melody maker writers and was given the same award by readers of black echoes a reissued wolf and leopard single and the eventual album release of the same name also sold well in the uk both topping the black echoes chart brown toured the uk in autumn  with big youth and described the tour its like i was appointed to deliver certain messages and now is the time to deliver them he had also begun producing recordings by his protege junior delgado in  brown moved to live in london and set up premises in battersea rise near clapham junction to relaunch the deb music label with castro brown with artists featured on the label including junior delgado  bob andy lennox brown and later gregory isaacs brown had further success himself with a discomix of how could i leave you a version of the sharks rocksteady standard how could i live with accompanying toast by prince mohamed in march  brown flew to jamaica where he was booked at the last minute to perform at the one love peace concert at the national arena backed by lloyd parks we the people band visions of dennis brown was given a wider distribution via a deal between lightning records and wea and topped the uk reggae album chart in september  this chart run lasting for five months in august  brown returned to the uk bringing junior delgado with him and deb music released a series of singles although they sold moderately compared to the labels earlier successes but in the same month browns breakthrough single was first released initially released as a discomix featuring a new version of money in my pocket and the deejay version cool runnings by price mohamed which became unavailable for a time after quickly selling out its first pressing this single gave brown his first uk top  hit reaching number  the following year and becoming one of the biggest international hits in jamaicas history after crossing over first into soul clubs and then rock clubs this success led to brown featuring on the cover of the nme in february  browns next two albums were both released on deb  so long rastafari and josephs coat of many colours although the label was closed down in  after which brown again did the rounds of jamaicas top producers as well as continuing selfproductions with singles such as the little village and do i worry in  am and the dancehall eraedit with continuing commercial success brown signed an international deal with am records in  and now based permanently in the uk his first album release for the label was the gibbsproduced foul play which while not wholly a success included the roots tracks the existence of jah and the world is troubled this was followed in  by love has found its way a gibbsbrownwillie lindo production that blended lovers rock with a more pop sound and again was not a great success his final album with the label s the prophet rides again again mixed roots themes with commercial rb style tracks and proved to be his swansong with the label while his association with am had taken him in a more commercial pop direction kingstons music scene had shifted towards the new dancehall era and brown enthusiastically adapted to the new sound recording for some of the genres major producers including prince jammy and gussie clarke in the early s he also started a new label yvonnes special dedicated to his wife in  he collaborated with gregory isaacs on the album two bad superstars meet and the hit single let aaf sumn recorded with sly  robbie and jammy which was followed by a second album featuring the two stars judge not in  brown released a huge amount of work through the s including the  jammyproduced album the exit but his biggest success of the decade came in  with the gussie clarkeproduced duet with isaacs big all round and the album unchallenged he continued to record prolifically in the s notably on the three against war album in  with beenie man and triston palma and on albums produced by mikey bennett and his profile in the united states was raised by a series of album releases on ras records in the late s he was managed by tommy cowan who contrasted brown to bob marley who he had also managed stating bob marley was a serious businessman i dont think dennis was as serious when it came to investment dennis was like a community person he would earn money and in one hour he would give it away brown said of his approach to songwriting in the late s when i write a song i try to follow josephs way  deliverance through vision from all  true vibration i want to be a shepherd in my work teaching and learning really singing so much i dont want to sing and not live it i must live it if i can sing songs that people can watch me living then they can take my work browns  album light my fire was nominated for a grammy award as was the last album recorded by brown let me be the one in  deathedit in the late s browns health began to deteriorate he had developed respiratory issues

actor and journalist and he grew up in a large tenement yard between north street and king street in kingston with his parents three elder brothers and a sister although his mother died in the s he began his singing career at the age of nine while still at junior school with an endofterm concert the first time he performed in public although he had been keen on music from an even earlier age and as a youngster was a keen fan of american balladeers such as brook benton sam cooke frank sinatra and dean martin he cited nat king cole as one of his greatest early influences he regularly hung around jjs record store on orange street in the rocksteady era and his relatives and neighbours would often throw brown pennies to hear him sing in their yard browns first professional appearance came at the age of eleven when he visited a local club where his brother basil was performing a comedy routine and where he made a guest appearance with the clubs resident group the fabulous falcons a group that included cynthia richards david scotty scott and noel brown on the strength of this performance he was asked to join the group as a featured vocalist when the group performed at a jlp conference at the national arena brown sang two songs  desmond dekkers unity and johnnie taylors aint that loving you  and after the audience showered the stage with money he was able to buy his first suit with the proceeds bandleader byron lee performed on the same bill and was sufficiently impressed with brown to book him to perform on package shows featuring visiting us artists where he was billed as the boy wonder as a young singer brown was influenced by older contemporaries such as delroy wilson whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing errol dunkley john holt ken boothe and bob andy browns first recording was an original song called lips of wine for producer derrick harriott but when this was not released he recorded for clement coxsone dodds studio one label and his first session yielded the single no man is an island recorded when brown was aged twelve and released in late  the single received steadily increasing airplay for almost a year before becoming a huge hit throughout jamaica brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for dodd amounting to around thirty songs and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists including providing harmonies along with horace andy and larry marshall on alton elliss sunday coming album brown was advised by fellow studio one artist ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting and after convincing dodd to buy him an instrument was taught the basics by ellis these studio one recordings were collected on two albums no man is an island and if i follow my heart the title track penned by alton ellis although brown had left studio one before either was released he went on to record for several producers including lloyd daley baby dont do it and things in life prince buster one day soon and if i had the world and phil pratt black magic woman let love in and what about the half before returning to work with derrick harriott recording a string of popular singles including silhouettes concentration he cant spell and musical heatwave with the pick of these tracks collected on the super reggae and soul hits album in  brown also recorded for vincent randy chin cheater dennis alcapone i was lonely and herman chin loy its too late and song my mother used to sing among others with brown still at school at this stage of his career international successedit in  brown began an association that would result in his breakthrough as an internationally successful artist he was asked by joe gibbs to record an album for him and one of the tracks recorded as a result money in my pocket was a hit with uk reggae audiences and quickly became a favourite of his live performances this original version of money in my pocket was in fact produced by winston niney holness on behalf of gibbs with musical backing from the soul syndicate in the same year brown performed as part of a christmas morning showcase in toronto ontario canada along with delroy wilson scotty errol dunkley and the fabulous flames where he was billed as the boy wonder of jamaica and was considered the star of the show in a local newspaper review the songs popularity in the uk was further cemented with the release of a deejay version aso we stay money in hand credited to big youth and dennis brown which outsold the original single and topped the jamaican singles chart brown and holness became close even sharing a house in pembroke hall brown followed this with another collaboration with holness on westbound train which was the biggest jamaican hit of summer  and browns star status was confirmed when he was voted jamaicas top male vocalist in a poll by swing magazine the same year brown followed this success with cassandra and no more will i roam and tracks such as africa and love jah displaying browns rastafari beliefs became staples on londons sound system scene in  brown was hospitalized due to fatigue caused by overwork although at the time rumours spread that he only had one lung and had only a week to live or had contracted tuberculosis he was advised to take an extended break from performing and concentrated instead on his college studies brown returned to music and toured the united kingdom for the first time in late summer  as part of a jamaican showcase along with cynthia richards al brown sharon forrester and the maytals after which he was invited to stay on for further dates where he was backed by the cimarons staying in the uk for another three months while in the uk he recorded for the first time since his hospitalization working with producer sydney crooks and again backed by the cimarons while brown was in the uk gibbs released an album collecting recordings made earlier in jamaica released as the best of dennis brown and browns first single to get a proper uk release was issued on the synda label  no more will i roam he returned to jamaica for christmas but six weeks later was back in the uk now with holness in tow as his business manager to negotiate a record deal with trojan records the first brown album to be released as a result being just dennis although the pair would be left out of pocket after trojans collapse and subsequent buyout by saga records on their return to jamaica brown and holness resumed recording in earnest with tracks for a new album including so long rastafari boasting and open the gate during  brown also recorded oneoff sessions for sonia pottinger if you leave me and bunny lee so much pain a duet with johnny clarke and the first recordings began to appear on browns new deb music label in the wake of the trojan collapse brown and holness arranged a deal with local independent label owners castro brown who ran morpheus records and larry lawrence ethnic fight to distribute their releases in the uk brown saw the uk as the most important market to target and performed for five consecutive nights at the georgian club in croydon to raise funds to start his new deb music label with castro brown in early  castro secured a deal with radio london disc jockey charlie gillett for morpheus and hence deb output to be issued through the latters oval records which had a distribution deal with virgin records but after a dispute over castros separate supply of these records to london record shops the deal was scrapped and the early deb releases suffered from a lack of promotion later that year brown voiced two tracks at lee scratch perrys black ark studio take a trip to zion and wolf and leopard the latter of which was a hit in jamaica and would prove to be one of browns most popular songs with a lyric criticizing those criminals who rode the natty dread bandwagon brown confirmed in an interview in black echoes that he had parted company with holness stating i was going along with one mans ideas for too long niney was trying to find a new beat at all times which was disconcerting so i hadnt been working with my true abilities now i know that i can produce myself brown began working again with joe gibbs with an agreement that in return for studio time for his own productions brown would allow gibbs use of any rhythm recorded in the process the first album from this arrangement the  release visions of dennis brown gave him his biggest success so far blending conscious themes and love songs and confirming browns transformation from child star to grown up artist the biblicalthemed sleeve and portrait of haile selassie on the back complemented the roots reggae tracks on the album including repatriation jah can do it and cover versions of earl s malcolm x and clive hunts milk and honey the album immediately entered the black echoes chart and stayed there well into the following year although it was only available in the uk as an expensive import visions was voted reggae album of the year by melody maker writers and was given the same award by readers of black echoes a reissued wolf and leopard single and the eventual album release of the same name also sold well in the uk both topping the black echoes chart brown toured the uk in autumn  with big youth and described the tour its like i was appointed to deliver certain messages and now is the time to deliver them he had also begun producing recordings by his protege junior delgado in  brown moved to live in london and set up premises in battersea rise near clapham junction to relaunch the deb music label with castro brown with artists featured on the label including junior delgado  bob andy lennox brown and later gregory isaacs brown had further success himself with a discomix of how could i leave you a version of the sharks rocksteady standard how could i live with accompanying toast by prince mohamed in march  brown flew to jamaica where he was booked at the last minute to perform at the one love peace concert at the national arena backed by lloyd parks we the people band visions of dennis brown was given a wider distribution via a deal between lightning records and wea and topped the uk reggae album chart in september  this chart run lasting for five months in august  brown returned to the uk bringing junior delgado with him and deb music released a series of singles although they sold moderately compared to the labels earlier successes but in the same month browns breakthrough single was first released initially released as a discomix featuring a new version of money in my pocket and the deejay version cool runnings by price mohamed which became unavailable for a time after quickly selling out its first pressing this single gave brown his first uk top  hit reaching number  the following year and becoming one of the biggest international hits in jamaicas history after crossing over first into soul clubs and then rock clubs this success led to brown featuring on the cover of the nme in february  browns next two albums were both released on deb  so long rastafari and josephs coat of many colours although the label was closed down in  after which brown again did the rounds of jamaicas top producers as well as continuing selfproductions with singles such as the little village and do i worry in  am and the dancehall eraedit with continuing commercial success brown signed an international deal with am records in  and now based permanently in the uk his first album release for the label was the gibbsproduced foul play which while not wholly a success included the roots tracks the existence of jah and the world is troubled this was followed in  by love has found its way a gibbsbrownwillie lindo production that blended lovers rock with a more pop sound and again was not a great success his final album with the label s the prophet rides again again mixed roots themes with commercial rb style tracks and proved to be his swansong with the label while his association with am had taken him in a more commercial pop direction kingstons music scene had shifted towards the new dancehall era and brown enthusiastically adapted to the new sound recording for some of the genres major producers including prince jammy and gussie clarke in the early s he also started a new label yvonnes special dedicated to his wife in  he collaborated with gregory isaacs on the album two bad superstars meet and the hit single let aaf sumn recorded with sly  robbie and jammy which was followed by a second album featuring the two stars judge not in  brown released a huge amount of work through the s including the  jammyproduced album the exit but his biggest success of the decade came in  with the gussie clarkeproduced duet with isaacs big all round and the album unchallenged he continued to record prolifically in the s notably on the three against war album in  with beenie man and triston palma and on albums produced by mikey bennett and his profile in the united states was raised by a series of album releases on ras records in the late s he was managed by tommy cowan who contrasted brown to bob marley who he had also managed stating bob marley was a serious businessman i dont think dennis was as serious when it came to investment dennis was like a community person he would earn money and in one hour he would give it away brown said of his approach to songwriting in the late s when i write a song i try to follow josephs way  deliverance through vision from all  true vibration i want to be a shepherd in my work teaching and learning really singing so much i dont want to sing and not live it i must live it if i can sing songs that people can watch me living then they can take my work browns  album light my fire was nominated for a grammy award as was the last album recorded by brown let me be the one in  deathedit in the late s browns health began to deteriorate he had developed respiratory issues
