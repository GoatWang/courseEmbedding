woman similar changes in appearance were given to jesus and the holy spirit the story of pain and redemption then resonated with the publicbut is youngs worldview important is his theology that big a dealjames de young thinks so in fact its so important that hes written a compelling book challenge to the shack in burning down the shack de young manages to shed important light on the implications of youngs pluralistic faith and provides readers with a gripping counterbalance to the popular little volume thats spent many weeks on the bestseller lists exploring the nature and character of god from scripture de young concludes that it is necessary to proceed carefully with the shack lest important truths be skewed and even jettisoned without being confrontational de young makes the case that dangers can lurk under the foundationabout the authorjames b de young is professor of new testament language and literature at western seminary portland ore where he has taught for  years seeking
