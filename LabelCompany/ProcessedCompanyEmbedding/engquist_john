this morning to our first quarter results our business and overall market conditions then leslie will review our financial results for the quarter when leslie finishes i will close with a few brief comments after which we would take your questions proceed to slide six please the first quarter was in line with our expectations and the current trends continue to reinforce our outlook for the year demand for rental equipment was solid which resulted in mid singledigit rental revenue growth and margin holding firmly on the yearoveryear basis while our rental business continues to benefit from increased activity in the eagle ford and permian basin as well as other oil field areas we still believe sustained oil prices around  a barrel would increase demand for new cranes total revenues decreased  or  million to  million the decline was primarily related to new equipment sales which declined  to  million given the shift in revenue mix gross margins were strong up more than  basis points from a year ago to  ebitda was  million compared to  million a year ago with margins increased to  compared to  slide seven please for the first quarter we generated net income of  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share a year ago demand has been solid with physical utilization at  for the quarter versus  a year ago on the oec basis our rental business performed well with revenues increasing  to  million margins were  while rental rates were down only  from a year ago dollar returns were  proceed to slide eight please this slide illustrates our nationwide footprint various regions  branch locations and the  greenfield sites that we have opened since the beginning of  we expect to open three more branch locations in  and remain focused on executing our greenfield strategy to expand our footprint and grow our business we believe the environment in our gulf coast region remains positive as a result of several factors texas our largest market continues to experience a very healthy economy is driving array of nonresidential projects the energy markets are also improving as a result of increased shale drilling activity in both taxes and louisiana a solid line of large industrial projects are either underway at breaking ground stage or scheduled to commence construction over the next few years just recently they have also been several large industrial projects announced in february for most plastics group began to seek permits from the state of louisiana to invest  billion to build petrochemical plants in the state in march exxonmobil announced plans to spend  billion on refineries petrochemical plants and other projects in and around the gulf coast region including certain previously announced project and in early april china based wan hue ph chemical announced the company will develop a  million chemical manufacturing complex in louisiana proceed to slide nine please activity in oil patch continued to accelerate during the first quarter driven primarily by the shale drillers in the permian and eagle ford basins at the end of the first quarter  rigs were operating in the us up  from  rigs at the end of the fourth quarter to put this is even better perspective of the  total rigs operating domestically on march st  or  of these rigs were drilling in our operating region our oil patch exposure at the end of the first quarter was roughly  of our total revenue down from a high  at peak all prices utilization in our four texas branches with heavy exposure to the oil patch averaged  during the first quarter on a combined basis up  basis points from the fourth quarter our rental business is the nearterm beneficiary of the improved energy markets as i mentioned earlier we believe  oil increased demand for new cranes sales in the oil patch proceed to slide  please the key take away from this slide is the outlook for the nonresidential construction market in general is positive for  and beyond major market indicators including the dodge momentum index and the abi forecast continued growth construction employment reaching eight year high in march and then there is the infrastructure spending wildcard proposed by the new administration in addition to significant other potential probusiness initiatives which could help extend the cycle for years to come at this time im going to turn the call over to leslie for the financial results leslie magee good morning everyone and thank you john ill begin on slide  to discuss our financials in greater detail as john discussed our rental business trends were positive however the weakness in new equipment sales persisted as we cautioned our listeners on our last call to summarize total revenues decreased   million in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago to  million with the strength in our rental business with the weakness in areas of our distribution business gross profit decreased  or  million to  million compared to a year ago on higher margins of  compared to  a year ago as for the rental segment rental revenues increased  to  million physical utilization remained healthy with average time utilization based on oec of  for the quarter compared to  a year ago demand increased in all product lines compared to a year ago as we anticipate new equipment sales declined  or  million to  million new cranes sales decrease  representing  million of the total  million declined from a year ago used equipment sales increased  or  million to  million largely as a result of higher used cranes and moving equipment sales partially offset by a decline in june awp equipment sales sales from our rental fleet comprised of  of total used equipment sales this quarter compared to  a year ago our parts and service segments delivered  million in revenue on a combined basis down  from a year ago total gross profit for the quarter was  million compared to  million a year ago a decrease of  on  decrease in revenue consolidated margins were  compared to  a year ago for more detail by segment rental gross margins for the quarter was  compared to  last year with a slight decrease due to higher maintenance and repair cost in depreciation expense we encourage slightly higher maintenance and repair cost compared to a year ago period largely as a result of the increase activity in our oil fleet market margins on new equipment sales were  for the first quarter compared to  a year ago largely due to lower margins on new crane and earthmoving sales used equipment sales gross margins were  compared to  last year margins on pure rental fleet only sales were  compared to  a year ago parts and service gross margin on a combined basis were  compared to  a year ago move to slide  please income from operations for the first quarter decreased  to  million compared to  million last year on a margin of  compared to  in the first quarter last year the decrease in income from operations is primarily due to lower revenues compared to year ago proceed to slide  net income was  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter compared to  million or  per diluted share in the same period a year ago our effective tax rate was  compared to  a year ago please move this slide  ebitda was  million in the first quarter compared to  million a year ago and ebitda margins were  compared to  a year ago next on slide  sga was  million a  million or  decrease over the same period last year sga as a percentage of revenue was  this quarter compared to  a year ago branch expansion cost increased

expenditures for the quarter were  million gross ppe capex for the quarter was  million and net was  million our average average fleet age as of march  was  months and we generated  million of cash in the first quarter compared to  million a year ago weve included a free cash flow gaap reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities in the appendix at the end of the presentation reconciling free cash flow for the same period is presented here on the slide next on slide  at the end of the first quarter the size of our rental fleet based on oec was  billion a  or  million increase from a year ago average dollar utilization was  compared to  a year ago proceed to slide  please at the end of the first quarter our outstanding balance under our  million abl facility was  million and therefore we had  million of availability at quarter end which is net of  million of outstanding letters of credit at this time i would turn the call back over to john for conclusion john engquist thank you leslie i think ive addressed all of these points in my previous comments but to conclude i want to say that we believe the current trends in our business and industry are very encouraging as we move further into  lastly we paid our th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on march  at this time we would like to take your questions operator please provide instructions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from neil frohnapple from longbow research neil frohnapple regarding new equipment sales obviously we weakness in current demand continues but was there something from a timing standpoint such as a few cranes shipped right after the quarterend which caused the step down in revenue from kind of where you guys have been trending in the last few quarters john engquist i think we did have a few machine slip i dont know how much that move the needle but brad you may… bradley barber neil we did i mean we had a handful of cranes looked in i dont think we want to get into habit of talking about delivery timing and schedules and slippage some of our german products was not delivered in time it still wouldve been a very difficult quarter but we certainly had cranes ship that did not make point of delivery dates and it wouldve helped some but still it would have been a tough comp neil frohnapple okay but generally you would still expect new equipment sales to sort of bounce back from q levels just directionally and i understand were still waiting on  oil so really how big the crane size but again just trying to calibrate expectations for the rest of the year i understand the business can be very lumpy but anymore color you can provide there will be great bradley barber look the first quarter is always our softness quarter from the sales perspective and from rental perspective utilization or rate or anything else so yes we would expect things to improve on the sales side as we move through the year and i can tell you we are quoting a lot more stuff right now and we are encouraged by that that had turned into purchase orders but we do see more code activity and yes you can expect sales to improve as they almost always do as we move into the year neil frohnapple okay great that’s helpful i’ll jump back in queue john engquist thank you operator and we will take our next question from nick coppola from thompson research group nick coppola hey good morning bradley barber good morning nick nick coppola so strong performance in terms of utilization improvement a larger fleet so i just wanted to talk about the rate environment and what would it take to see an improvement in rates on the yearoveryear basis to what scale is seasonality and what do you think kind of the rate trajectory looks like from here john engquist look as i just stated the first quarter is always a tough quarter its your low point in utilization you have a lot of fleet sitting and its a tough environment to drive rates and its not just us its everybody in the sector so we are pretty comfortable only being down  point particularly when to look at the numbers of big projects that we participate in thats a pretty tough rate environment our view is still that as we move into the year rates will return positive and we would still hopeful that we will be positive by yearend on a yearoveryear basis were really need to see the big rental players start being more rational in the big projects i can tell you the rate environment there is really difficult and i think it’s really hurting rates in the entire sector nick coppola okay and then i just wanted to ask you – just maybe elaborate on demand trends in the oil patch you certainly mentioned some positive comments about trends there moving fleet back into the yield per permian or are you continuing to move fleet there i mean i guess what is the direction look like there john engquist yes we have continue to move fleet demand is strong our utilization running at very high level from the mids to  in our heavy oil field markets midland would be a good example we see that environment very steady and improving so we have continue to move fleet in there but ill say we are doing so cautiously we are being very careful not to over fleet those markets nick coppola yeah that really makes lot of sense thanks for answering my questions operator well take our next question from seth weber from rbc capital markets seth weber hey good morning everybody john engquist good morning seth seth weber a few questions here just sticking on the energy patch discussion we have heard elsewhere that that projects that are coming back on in the energy patch or coming back at lower rate versus prior where we were at the peak is that is that accurate or are you guys are seeing that as well i guess is the first question john engquist you are talking about oil field upstream stuff seth weber yes john thanks john engquist i am going to refer brad on that question the question is are we getting lower rates than we were on this equipment as going back in the oil patch bradley barber the answer is no we are not i think john spoke to were moving back in cautiously rates are very important to us and the best rates that we generally have on of equipment types are in the oilfield and that will continue to be our position we are not going to forgo rates in add fleet to the oilfield so the answer would be no we have got quality rates that are improving in the oilfield seth weber okay thanks so just to clarify it was relative to where it was at the peak not relative to the rest bradley barber i guess ill have to seth take a  do a quick analysis i suspect our rates are very similar today to where they were at the peak but you know i would have to do an analysis to give you the definitive answer but i strongly suspect there are very similar today to where they were at the peak seth weber okay thanks and just switching it up little bit the parts and services business continues to be kind of frustrating here i mean cranes have been software while but then a new slide deck you referenced this in potential for nearterm benefits on the parts and service business and we have seen some pick up and that aftermarket pickup from some of the other oems and whatnot do you think the parts and service sales turned positive here over the next  i mean can may be positive for the year how are you  i guess may be whats behind the comment on slide john engquist look we are seeing some parts and service opportunities come from the oil patch and obviously from our earthmoving account but crane rebuild crane remanufacturing is a huge driver of our parts and service business and that is just really down right now we are just not getting any activity in that area and thats really hurting us on the parts and service side so the weakness you are seeing is almost totally related to the weakness in the crane market and when that starts to rebound and it will its a question of time youll see our parts and service business rebound with it seth weber okay so you see you think its kind of flattish this year then is that – is that the way you think about it john engquist seth yes flatfish would be probably a good way to think about it and the only additional color i would add would be that an increase and parts and service particularly around cranes needs a substantial piece will be the indicator that sales would quickly follow seth weber sure all right that makes sense thanks and then maybe just for leslie a quick one its tax rate now structurally lower or do you think it goes back to that kind of low  range leslie magee no for this year i would say that it is structurally lower so the  is a good range for the remaining quarter with the exception of the third quarter we are estimating a discrete item which would substantially over the tax rate end of third quarter this is something like around  so for the year we would be  to  on our effective tax rate once we take into account the discrete item in the third quarter seth weber right okay leslie magee it’s a little unusual seth weber okay and then sort of going forward it should be in the high s then is it for when you think about it leslie magee so beyond  seth weber yes yes leslie magee it’s a little early to say i would say at least  going forward but again it is a little early to commit to that seth weber okay all right thank you very much everybody john engquist thanks operator we will take our next question from joe box from keybanc capital markets joe box yes hey guys john engquist hi joe joe box question for you on the dollar utilization can you guys give up little bit more color on  basis point jump in your dirt equipment and the  basis –  basis point jump in the telehandler relative to awp that was flat yearoveryear i guess is that just a function of maybe buying more aerial equipment and the new equipment dragging down dollar utilization are you seeing any differences in either time out or rental rates for those different buckets john engquist well if i understand i think the increase as we saw in dollar out or relative to the increase in physical utilization primarily i am not – look there are puts and takes within the product as you said we lump telehandlers into the aerial work platform group and were not going to comment on product types within but there are always puts and takes the broader issue was increase physical time utilization joe box so i mean is there anything to read into that if the dirt site has higher dollar utilization and if its coming from time is that a function of some projects ramping up is that pads are being created on the oil patch side anything to read into that john engquist i think looked historically earthmoving is been among our higher dollar utilization so its a product that some companies are challenged to manage from a maintenance standpoint we do a pretty nice job we continue to grow our earthmoving component of our business over the last few years in fact earthmoving has been taking a larger percent i mean its growing a little quicker than most of the other products within the broader mix we’ve also had some decline when you think about a little bit of a shift toward a benefit value utilization we had a decline with cranes cranes carry our lowest dollar utilization historically even when they are better or more difficult they carried the lowest dollar utilization so we have got some slight declines there we basically reinvest those dollars in higher returning product joe box maybe switching gears then incremental rental gross profit margins came in at about  looks like its below the more typical  plus range can you maybe put some color around that margin and may be just a sense for where it could shake out as we move to the year john engquist sure i would say that for the first quarter even it’s below what you would prefer to it’s kind of norm of  it is going to be due to a higher maintenance and repair cost the that i refer too so throughout the course of the year we would expect that to normalize along with some of the other positive drivers john talked about rate a little bit physical utilization and then the fleet growth so i think those were all balanced out to get a more normalized rental incremental margin joe box got it thanks leslie and maybe just to take a different angle on your distribution business i guess specifically around new sales we are starting to see some signs of life out of the oems do you expect similar benefits to eventually kind of filter into the new equipment sales or do you think you are too crane heavy to see that type of benefit any sort of change maybe in the relationships with your customers just any sort of color around the relationship and how we should think about that uptick in oems relative to what you guys could see john engquist when you speak to uptick in oems are you speaking of earthmoving manufacturers joe box more on the earth side than the crane i guess to be specific john engquist yes look we feel good about our earthmoving end market the demand is solid we have got a lot of activity there the area continues to be very weak and challenging for us is on the cranes side this demand is about as weak as ive seen it with that said we are quoting a lot more equipment and i mean a lot more equipment than we have been that is not translated in the purchase orders as of yet but we’re cautiously optimistic that were going to start seeing some pickup in demand there but on the earthmoving side we are very pleased with what we’re seeing i mean there is solid activity and is just really strong demand in the nonresidential construction market and that demand is very broadbased so we feel good about our end markets john engquist joe the other thing i would add i know youre talking about distribution but as a leading indicator our largest increase as we sit here today yearoveryear has been in earthmoving utilization its up about  basis points yearoveryear so thats a good indicator of what we think will continue to accomplish on the distribution side as well now keeping context we are commodity dealer thats the broadest piece of our earthmoving distribution we’re also a distributor but we are a commodity dealer in two states so in the broader mix of distribution revenues cranes is heavily weighted to cranes and i think you’re aware of that joe box got it that’s good color thank you guys john engquist you bet operator operator instructions we will take our next question from sean wondrack with deutsche bank sean wondrack hi john and leslie how are you john engquist good how are you sean wondrack very good so just going back to the oil and gas basins again i know we talked about this a little bit last quarter but just wanted to see if you can give us update how have you seen the competitive environment down there in terms of operators who are still servicing and operators who are basically gone insolvent and basically out of the industry now especially at this point in time what you are seeing out there john engquist you know from a competitive environment standpoint just relative to the oil patch i think were probably seeing pretty good discipline i think people are being fairly cautious you know these oil prices bounce around a little bit i mean they have been staying in the s but i think everybody is cautiously optimistic and being fairly disciplined from a competitive standpoint we are seeing the crazy competition crazy rate pressures on a big petrochemical projects the more downstream stuff the rate environment there is brutal right now sean wondrack and when you basically approach something like that when you know they are basically fighting for the lowest rates whats your take on that how do you respond to that situation do you share that revenue or do you continue to compete for it john engquist we do some of both i mean we get to a point where we walk away from the deal based on rate we do participate on those projects and they are not the biggest driver of our business but we own a lot of those big projects and obviously we have to it impacts our overall rate performance but you know we do on a regular basis walk away from deals because of rates on those big projects sean wondrack right thank you for that and then just a quick remainder what is your cash tax position currently do you still have nols or do you expect that to continue for the future john engquist were still in the nol position so really not a significant cash taxpayer at all sean wondrack and do you think thatll continue into  or will you mostly exhausted them in  john engquist they will run into  yes sean wondrack okay great and then just lastly you know as i look at bloomberg right now your bonds are trading at roughly  theyre obviously callable in september you know you have some rate hikes going on this year are you considering refinancing these bonds john engquist were always looking are our options as it relates to our bonds so thats just an ongoing situation for us and you know well watch that and you know watch what rates are doing and well make that decision at the appropriate time and with thats something i think we certainly stay on top of sean wondrack great thank you answering my questions john engquist sure operator we will take our next question from steven fisher with ubs steven fisher thanks good morning wondering if you guys… john engquist good morning steven fisher morning what if you could about your experience at conexpo related to cranes clearly there was a lot of optimism at the show in general it still seems like things are a little soft in the crane market were you guys placing orders taking orders or just maybe if you could talk about your experience at conexpo bradley barber sure steve so the experience was good it was very positive we just placed orders we did take some orders the order intake was not as robust the kind of expo was a few years ago but it was certainly a positive event and we had an outstanding turnout of our largest most loyal customers so good event positive things happen because of the event that being said we are still overshadowed by the broader issue and thats cheap oil and weak energy markets steven fisher was there a  that was helpful was there sort of a waiting towards where the orders what kind of products you are taking orders on bradley barber its a mix of products there was no particular product type that stands out thats worth noting steven fisher okay just looking at the dollar utilization on cranes coming down im not sure brad if you mention what driving that decline in utilization was that the gulf coast in particular bradley barber its broadbased and the drivers lower physical utilization and substantially lower rental rates our largest the decreases have come in the cranes segments as you may can imagine steven fisher i mean so no particular geography thats features and just leslie to clarify your expectation on rental gross margin do you expect that to be flat for the rest of the year or up on a yearoveryear basis leslie magee yeah we would expect it to be up on a yearoveryear basis steven fisher okay and then just lastly what the utilization of the texas branches that you open in the later part of last year either on a q basis or a kind of a current run rate just curious how quickly those branches have ramped up utilization john engquist yeah we dont quote utilization at the per branch level but i will say that the utilization of those locations is very similar to the utilization of the locations within the region steven fisher okay terrific thanks a lot john engquist thank you operator our next question comes from sean wondrack with deutsche bank sean wondrack hey just one followup here on slide nine you list your end markets and clearly your industrial nonres and res but then you also have  for this other category is there any way you could break that down a little more for us like what does that represent exactly are there any bigger buckets in that does that have any oil and gas in it john engquist no sean its more of a catch off for things that are not squarely in one of the other buckets and we typically dont break it out in further detail but its running pretty consistently sean wondrack okay all right fair enough thank you john engquist thank you operator that concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the call back to mr john engquist for closing comments and remarks i want to thank everybody for participating today obviously we feel very good about our end markets we think we got some runway in front of us and i think were going to have a nice year and hopefully a nice a several years in front of us so thanks for participating look forward

goshop period which runs through august   during which the special committee of neff’s board of directors with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors may solicit our alternative proposals to acquire neff there is a possibility that this process will result in neffs receipt of a superior offer or that neff will approve our consummate an alternative transaction in lieu of our proposed transaction the transaction is expected to close in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of  and is subject to customary closing conditions including hartscottrodino act clearance proceed to slide  please the neff acquisition is the major milestone for the future of he and from absolutely every perspective we believe that it was a right deal at the right time the combined companies would be one of the largest equipment rental companies in the united states generating nearly  billion in annual revenue on a ltm basis ending march   with a fleet consisting of more than  units at  billion of equipment based on original equipment cost as of the same date the transaction will increase our rental fleets exposure to the earthmoving asset class which is a relatively underpenetrated product line compared to the aerial work platform equipment the deal will increase the density of our existing footprint in the strategically important and high growth gulf coast midatlantic southeast and west coast region the deal will also increase hes penetration in the nonresidential construction market and expand its exposure to new regional and local customers in overall construction markets with the addition of neffs earthmoving assets we believe well be well positioned to benefit from new infrastructure projects and governmental spending initiatives lastly but very importantly he and neff are culturally similar in many respects which is extremely important in any deal especially one of this scale not only are both companies similarly structured and operated both employee bases are very focused on the highest standard of work and customer satisfaction safety and entrepreneurial spirit at this time ill let brad provide an overview of the combined companies brad barber good afternoon everyone and thank you john please proceed to slide  we believe the neff acquisition is a transformative step for he john leslie and myself and our entire management team and employees are extremely energized to get the transition behind us and integrate neff into our operations we believe the combination of he and neff will result in extremely formidable equipment rental and integrated equipment services company this slide affixes several key metrics for he neff and how he is expected to look post closing the neff acquisition will significantly increase our scale on a combined basis for the last  months ending march   the company has generated nearly  billion in total revenue  million in rental revenue and  million in adjusted ebitda our branch count renewed and our employee base will increase by more than  individuals let me provide a few comments about fleet which was a significant strategic checkbox with this deal as of march   the companys combined fleet totaled  billion based on oec and consisted of more than  pieces of machinery the combined company will possess one of the largest earthmoving rental fleets in the industry as of march   the combined companys earthmoving fleet totaled  million and consisted of more than  units with an average age for neffs fleet at  months compared to  months for he average age for neffs earthmoving fleet was  months compared to  months for he our fleet mix will undergo a significant shift post closing using the march st fleet statistics for both companies aerial work platforms will continue to represent the largest component of our fleet but will decrease to  from  and earthmoving would increase to  from  in terms of neffs rental revenues by end market as of march    was infrastructure  residential construction   excuse me  nonresidential construction  residential construction  other  municipal and  oil and gas please proceed to slide  this map depicts hes current  branches and neffs current  branches the map demonstrates why we believe neffs existing footprint is an extremely strategic fit for he increasing branch and customer coverage density in a higher growth gulf coast midatlantic southeast and west coast regions both he and neff customers will benefit from bestinclass practices in a wide range of equipment in more locations please proceed to slide  we expect total cost synergies between  million and  million and believe this is a very achievable number in terms of total operating cost income statement synergies are anticipated to come from a combination of closing select overlapping branches benefit from a new regional operating structure and reduction in corporate overhead total cost synergies would have been even higher but were partially offset by differences in accounting policies primarily related to the treatment of depreciation expense cash flow synergies are expected to be realized from fleet and rolling stock procurement savings through favorable equipment pricing vendor consolidation and our ability to leverage large purchase volumes in terms of timing we anticipate the synergies to be fully realized by the end of  i will now turn the call over to leslie to discuss the financial implications of the transaction leslie leslie magee thank you brad please just stay to slide  the financial aspects of the neff deal are very attractive and transformation as well so let me quickly hit the highlight so we can move onto your question we expect to finance the transaction with a balance mix of borrowings on a new abl credit facility longterm debt and equity as previously announced we believe this is an appropriate mix for our capital structure enabling us to continue investing in growth the  billion purchase price including the  million net debt will be paid in cash we expect our current credit ratings will be maintained with the use of equity to partially fund the transaction our increased operating scale and our commitment to delever based upon late third quarter closing we anticipate leverage of approximately three times based on debt to adjusted ebitda by the end of  and further reduce to approximately  times by the end of  the transaction is noncontingent on financing as john indicated he has a paying committed financing from wells fargo and supported this transaction subject to customary conditions please proceed to slide  in summary in addition to the strategic rationale john and brad discussed earlier the neff acquisition brings very attractive financial characteristic as well beginning with an immediate  plus percent increase in revenue combined with the run rate cost synergies of  million to  million as brad discussed by  we expect deal to be accretive to adjusted eps when you factor in cost synergies and approximately  million present value of estimated tax benefits that brings the adjusted purchased price multiples to  times a very attractive rate of return for the acquisition deal will also have a positive impact on margin based on march   ltm revenue and ebitda margins are combined margins with increase  basis points to  including run rate cost synergies before i turn the call to john for his conclusions i want to remind everyone that we do not anticipate making any further comments regarding the transaction for our business generally until we report our second quarter earnings on july  john john engquist thank you leslie please proceed to slide  were extremely excited about this transaction for the numerous reasons we outlined in our comments we say afternoon acquiring neff is strategic and timely for our company as we expect it to provide immediate financial benefits scale and exposure to new end market and customers we’re also pleased with the structure of the transaction which should allow us to maintain a flexible capital structure everyone at he is egger to begin the integration process with the neff team we look forward to welcoming neffs talented employee base to the he family to offer a more coverage and capabilities to support our combined customer base and to continuing our work to create value for our shareholders we will now take questions operator please provide instructions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and we will take our first question from nick coppola with thompson research group please go ahead unidentified analyst good morning guys this is steven on  good afternoon this is steven on for nick a couple of questions now that you have combined two of the largest players in the industry and you are now about the fourth largest player in the gen rent industry can you talk about little more specifically your advantages of scale now how this benefits you at buying power the ability to share fleet across the network expand on that a little bit john engquist yes look this definitely gives us better coverage we have more locations they are having earthmoving we are having aerials we see just a lot of benefits it’s a high synergy deal we are going to be able to take a lot of cost down of the deal and at the same time cover the markets better neff has a different customer base than we do we are heavily weighted to the larger project larger customers neff does a really good job with the smaller projects smaller customers this is a really really good fit for us unidentified analyst and turning on from that with the difference in the age of equipment for both companies with hes fleet being so much younger especially on the earthmoving side what is the outlook for acquiring new equipment once the deal is closed john engquist nothing out of the ordinary we are going to continue our capex plan on both sides neff has a capex plan we do no significant changes obviously we will be selling off the oldest part of their fleet and replacing some of that equipment but we don’t see it creating any unusual capex requirements right now unidentified analyst excellent and one last question does  having the new neffs branch network provide any strategic platform for growing the equipment sales side of your business thank you john engquist no it does not i mean neff is a pure rental play and it will stay such operator and we will take our next question from joe box with keybanc capital markets joe box so just want to go back to that strategy question when i think of your business john obviously you guys have a lot of large project work but i tend to think about you guys as both being a bit regional maybe super regional so when you want these two companies together does it ultimately open up more national account business that maybe on a standalone basis both you and neff for maybe too small to play in before john engquist i think there is some benefit there i mean it gives us better coverage and probably a better fleet mix so i think it opens up some opportunities there i think the real play here is these different customer bases that we have i think there is going to be some real crossselling opportunities there that are going to be very important to this business joe box i apologize if i missed it but do you actually say the amount of overlap that you guys have on a customer basis brad barber no we have not but its  we view this as very minimal and let me go back to add on to johns comments weve been successful neffs been successful particularly with strategic accounts more regional type accounts i think the better balance of fleet mix is going to be a nice advantage and that will allow us to grow those types of accounts more than we could have without the combination of the two companies joe box so and obviously your strategy up to this point has largely been in greenfield expansion i dont know what happens to that strategy going forward i assume it get puts on hold but can you maybe just talk about how you plan to kind of match these two companies together how you think about the benefits of having density in a given market with multiple locations and what the overall benefit would be there versus maybe saying okay weve got three locations in dallas lets look to  restructure that down to one or two locations and ultimately going to get a cost savings from that john engquist so look as weve gone through our greenfield strategy and houston and dallas are great examples where weve added multiples of locations over the last four or five years weve realized cost savings on the transaction meaning less time less cost to deliver to a job because were physically closer weve realized that just how underpenetrated some of our opportunities had been and in every case when weve kind of added a second third or fourth location in one of these markets its of been the proverbial one plus one is equal to three force and we view this as something similar now overtime were going to focus on integrating the businesses performing at high quality levels and as you stated were likely to pause our greenfield strategy for a period of time during the integration but we see opportunities for both of these two combined to continue to grow similarly in some of these large markets and in many cases one large location in a major metropolitan area youre significantly disadvantaged due to the logistics associated with that brad barber yes joe the consolidation well have on locations is where weve two locations that within half a mile or a mile apart in a major market where these locations are spread out thats a benefit thats  nothing will be trying to take cost out of that that helps us better penetrate the market joe box understood one last one from me and then ill hop back in line but so whats the interest expense assumption that you guys are thinking about on the financing here and how should we think about the dividend going forward is that still part of the capital allocation john engquist absolutely the dividend will stay in place and i think the cost of the financing remains to be seen in and i assume youre talking about the note but our anticipation is somewhere in the  range joe box so but therell be a new abl facility there too right i mean i dont know if theres any opportunity to reduce the interest expense there as well john engquist therell be a new abl facility yes this is going to be a mix of abl and new notes and some equity operator and well take our next question from seth weber with rbc capital market seth weber i wanted to ask about the systems that youre going to be using so i dont know too much about neff systems but are they compatible with your current systems and is there going to be some sort of blending of that the internal operations or how should we think about this process of kind of getting everybody on the same page if thats what youre going to be doing john engquist yes seth look weve invested over the course of last seven or eight years of tremendous amount of money in systems to position our self to be able to run a much much larger business many times larger so we developed a platform that will support that neff will be integrated onto our platform and totality so they will be brought on our platform and that’s why we run the business seth weber okay do you have sense for i mean there has been a lot of discussion around the industry lately around contract mix day week month et cetera based on your comments about smaller customer et cetera i image there mix is more skewed towards daily or weekly rentals but do you have data around that relative to what to your kind of set up right now john engquist look i believe there average renewal contract is by a little shorter than our average contract because of that mix but i don’t have any data here in front of me that i can share with you on that seth weber okay and i guess may be just for leslie i just want to make sure i am understanding this different accounting policies statement is that just a function of the useful life on the earthmoving equipment versus your current mix or  i just want to make sure im understanding that leslie magee its different life across their fleet along with different salvage value seth weber okay so theyre assuming some sort of salvage value john engquist that’s correct the net effect is that they depreciate their equipment little longer than we do seth weber their earthmoving equipment is depreciated longer than your earthmoving equipment or just in general fleet john engquist in general seth weber but is the earthmoving equipment about on the same methodology john engquist same thing they depreciate their earthmoving fleet a little longer than we do operator we will take our next question from steven fisher from ubs steven fisher just to clarify on the deleveraging what is the expectation of that deleveraging will come from cash flow debt reduction  cash flow based debt reduction or just to increase ebitda or some combination john engquist both leslie magee combination of both john engquist yes steven fisher okay and i guess as you consider the possible strategic action that you could have taken here how did you weigh the decision to go into say a larger earthmoving heavy company versus may be a specialty company that they have had higher returns or a company not into your main geographic region john engquist yes look weve looked at the concept of specialty businesses many many times you tend to pay a very high multiple for those businesses and when you integrate i mean the company like he that multiple seems to get homogenized then i think you lose it we like what were doing we like the fleet mix combination here we like the earthmoving business weve been an earthmoving distributor for many many many years we understand the earthmoving business we know how to maintain that type fleet we know how to deal with undercarriages it’s a business we like its one of our highest dollar return assets its the largest secondary markets of any product type we deal and so its easy to adjust those fleets up and down the secondary markets are huge they are always liquid its an asset class that enjoys solid residual values there is really nothing about the earthmoving business that we don’t like and we were growing that aspect of our business before we got together when neff on this transaction this just accelerates that a lot so we are very happy with this acquisition and their fleet mix steven fisher okay and then lastly i know leslie mentioned the ebitda margins should go up i think you said it was about  basis points what does the increasing mix of earthmoving due to the overall returns on invested capital of the business leslie magee we have to do further analysis and followup i don’t have that exact analysis in front of me brad barber yes but i would point to the comment john just made that earthmoving generally carries the highest dollar utilization of all the product types that we carry such point nice gp and its one of the easier fleets to manage whenever you need to readjust your mix of proposition so maybe directly that can help you that it is among if not the highest dollar utilization of the products family that offer operator we will take our next question from scott napier with oppenheimer scott napier first one for me could you please discuss rental penetration opportunity within earthmoving and in the broader portfolio in your consideration from that aspect on the acquisition john engquist yes and that’s a great question and its one of the things we like about this acquisition earthmoving equipment is relatively under penetrated in the rental markets if you look at the aerial business its almost all rentals  nobody buy the areas anymore its almost totally rented so the penetration is in the  range i think earthmoving penetration is around  so we think that gives us some real nice growth opportunities in front of us scott napier i didn’t see in the presentation pack and maybe you are not prepared to provide at this juncture but considerations of growth maintenance capex of the combined company and will there be any dramatic sales or increases the capex upon consummation of the deal thanks john engquist there will not be dramatic increases to capex no operator and we will take our next question from sean wondrack with deutsche bank sean wondrack just a couple of more questions for you first id like to ask you what was the rationale behind how the transaction rose did you guys approach neff or did they approach you can you talk about that a little bit john engquist well look over the course of last three or four years we looked at lot of opportunities out there and weve looked at about everything thats come to market and weve never felt like we found the right fit whether its multiple expectations issues with fleet cultural issues whatever we havent found the right fit we feel like this is the right fit we approached neff through our financial advisor and were able to get together on this and couldnt be more excited about it sean wondrack and just given that theres been quite a few acquisitions in the market this year whether you have indiscernible and now you guys are acquiring neff do you think theres a transition within the industry to be a little more acquisitive right now given the potential for maybe a little bit of a longer cycle and some infrastructure programs out there john engquist well i think youve got a pretty fragmented sector here theres a lot of small players and so i wouldnt expect you to continue to see a certain amount of consolidation it is our belief that this cycle has been extended so theres some activity i dont have any real insights or what thats going to look like going forward but i would expect to see more consolidation sean wondrack and then im not sure if youve given any specifics surrounding this lately but the debt and equity split what percentage of the deal do you expect to fund with debt versus equity and have you publicly disclosed that or leslie magee we previously released an k and so what we intend to do currently is a  billion in abl  million in senior unsecured notes and up to  million in equity based on todays expectations sean wondrack right thats great and do you have any numbers of the neff family joining your company any members of management are joining your board john engquist not at this time no sean wondrack and then very quick last question when you think about working capital with the inclusion of neff do you think that there should be a big movement one way or another this year leslie magee no wed not expect that operator operator instructions well take our next question from ross gilardi with bank of america ross gilardi i just had a question wonder if you could just flush out the goshop theory a little bit more any other color you could provide and based on your understanding as neffs been shopped already and why establish formality around that what happens at the point that the goshop theory expires to the point that the deal actually close does the breakup fee come into play or something or john engquist no no i mean im not sure i understand your question i mean i think goshop theory theyre pretty common when youre acquiring a public company its basically protection for the board and they want to make sure theyre getting the best price they can get for their shareholders so nothing uncommon there ross gilardi is there a breakup fee with the deal right now john engquist no ross gilardi and the extent that you can answer this in the event there was a higher bid for neff how would you think about he from  how should we think about he from credit prospective would you  you’re overall wiliness to have a lower credit rating and just how would think about the capital structure in the event to this became more of a competitive option type process john engquist well i mean i think theres a lot of speculation going on there and we will cross that bridge when we get there im not sure what you meant by your comment on credit ratings we don’t anticipate doing anything thats going lower our credit rating operator operator instructions we have a followup question from joe box with keybanc capital markets joe box just wondering if you guys could put some more color around the tax step up i think you said leslie that the mpv is worth about a half turn toward the value of the deal if i heard that right ultimately curious about what the free cash flow profile is going to look like going forward and how long this could erratically push out cash taxes leslie magee right so there is obviously significant nols evolved and so i believe theyre going to run out four were estimating today into  thats what were looking at joe box so that the nols and the tax step up that come from this deal so you wouldn’t have cash taxes until  with the deal correct leslie magee right no significant cash taxes to speak up until  joe box okay great remind me what was that before hand with just he leslie magee the runoff of nols the pure runoff  im not sure i understand your question brad barber our cash payer next year midyear next year leslie magee and we ended  with close to a  million in nols joe box got it so then it does theoretically change the free cash flow profile the combined company it ultimately just pushes out your cash tax leslie magee thats correct joe box okay and then can you just let me talk about the cadence of synergies of frontloaded item or should we think about it being spread evenly through  john engquist look we think we will get half the synergies in  and then be fully synergized in  operator and it appears that there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to john engquist for any additional or closing remarks john engquist well i just want to thank everybody for being on the call i hope you can tell how excited were about this acquisition its transformational for us it moves us strategically where we think we need to be to really create significant shareholder value and that’s what our job is so thank you for being on the call and we look forward to speaking with you
