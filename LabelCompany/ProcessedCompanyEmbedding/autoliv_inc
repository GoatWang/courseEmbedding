greaterthanexpected impact on the auto safety product makers results matthew dilallo tmfmd jul   at pm autoliv nysealv didnt like what it spied on the horizon when it reported firstquarter results a few months ago at that time ceo jan carlson stated that the company saw some uncertainties relating to light vehicle production growth including high inventory levels and slower sales momentum especially in north america and china those worrisome trends for slowing light vehicle production didnt go away during the second quarter causing autolivs results to come in below expectations furthermore the company anticipates that those headwinds will persist during the third quarter which led it to reduce its fullyear organic sales growth guidance autoliv results the raw numbers metric

lightvehicle production growth slowed during the quarter autoliv anticipated that organic sales would grow by around  this quarter however after adjusting for the impact of currencies organic sales only increased  due to lowerthanexpected lightvehicle sales in china and north america overall lightvehicle production was flat during the quarter as a  decline in china and a  decrease the americas overwhelmed a doubledigit jump from japan hardest hit by the flattening out of production was the companys electronics segment where reported revenue fell  and was still down  after adjusting for the negative impact of currencies sales of restraint control and sensing products dropped  while revenue from brake systems was down  the lone bright spot was active safety sales which rose  on an organic basis thanks to strong sales of radar and camera systems autolivs passive safety segment was also under pressure during the quarter sales slipped  though they were up  after adjusting for the impact of currencies thanks to a  organic rise in airbag sales primarily on strength in china and japan the weaker organic sales growth caused margins to come in a bit below expectations the company anticipated that its adjusted operating margin would be around  but it came in at  several items caused earnings per share to fall despite a slight rise in operating income including tax items currencies and the impact of equity accounting on investments on a more positive note operating cash flow surged  to  million due to changes in working capital which is the money it needs to run its daytoday operations what management had to say autoliv ceo jan carlson commented on what drove its results during the second quarter i am pleased that we continue to execute well in passive safety and that proactive adjustments to a weaker market in china and north america helped the segment generate another quarter of double digit operating margin despite continued elevated investments for growth we managed another quarter with good operating efficiency and our strong gross margin performance enabled us to meet our adjusted operating margin expectation although the organic sales growth was slightly below our expectation due to lower light vehicle production in china and north america order intake continued on a high level in passive safety in the quarter as carlson points out the company operated well in a lessthanideal environment automakers had hoped that their strong sales momentum from last year would continue in  but that hasnt been the case gm nysegm for example recently reduced its forecast for  us vehicle sales the us automaker now foresees sales in the low  million range down from an initial expectation that sales would match last years peak of  million one of the culprits is a glut of cars on the market which is causing gm to slow production  looking forward autoliv expects higher lightvehicle inventory in the us and elsewhere as well as slow sales momentum and uncertainty in china and north america to continue to impact its sales in the near term because of that the company only expects organic sales growth in the range of  to  during the third quarter with an operating margin in the  to  range given the weakness in the second quarter and the outlook for the third autoliv is reducing its fullyear expectations the company now sees organic sales growth of around  for the full year down from its initial expectation of a  increase that said the company does still expect its operating margin to be around  for the year matt dilallo has no

positions stay strong the markets for the company’s key products are expected to grow faster than the economies of the respective geographical regions our dcf analysis shows that there is a considerable upside opportunity at current market levels autoliv inc alv is a world leader in automotive safety the companys share price has fallen from the level that we consider to be fair our target range is    per share since june  the decline was mainly caused by the brexit panic the brexit referendum was held on thursday june   to decide whether the uk should leave or remain in the european union the result is wellknown the next day autolivs shares were under pressure see the graph below the companys shares are listed on the new york stock exchange nyse alv and its swedish depository receipts are listed on the omx nordic exchange in stockholm aliv sdb as a result the european asset sale was the driver for the shares price decline autoliv inc has swedish roots but at the present time the company is a multinational and highly diversified usincorporated firm with little business exposure in europe more imporantly the company is in a good financial shape and operates in the favorable business climate as a result our valuation model shows a significant upside potential source investopediacom dependence on europe according to companys annual report  the companys sales are split over several hundred contracts covering approximately  vehicle models which generally moderates the effect of changes in vehicle demand of individual countries and regions or stops in production due to for instance natural disasters the risk in fluctuating sales has also been mitigated by autolivs rapid expansion in asia and other growth markets which has reduced the companys former high dependence on europe from more than  of sales to a diversified mix with europe the americas and asia each accounting for roughly one third of  sales source autolivs annual report the companys customer base has become more balanced and diversified as a result of autolivs significant expansion in asia in fy the asian sales reached a of  of total sales in comparison sales in the

keiretsu of honda which has a  ownership stake in the company some might say that the june  events affected many companies shares not only european ones but in fact if we compare the price movement of autolivs shares with competitors like visteon corp  vc delphi automotive plc  dlph and denso corp  we see a recovery in the rivals share prices source morningstarcom there does not seem to be reasons why autolivs shares should not follow the trends of the companys peers business climate the  driver autoliv inc is a socalled tier  supplier of the autoparts for light vehicles this means company sells its products directly to the original equipment manufacturers oem consequently the companys sales are driven by light vehicle production market experts see a potential for the continuous growth for the next six years source pwc autofacts march   the companys management describes the target market as follows our addressable market is expected to grow at a cagr of approximately  until  to about  billion based on the current macroeconomic outlook and our internal market intelligence and estimates… source annual report we will show the effect of this expected growth in the assumptions to our valuation model business climate government regulation automotive safety systems have a great impact on society thus government regulations can create additional demand for such products below is the regulatory timeline for safety technology recommendationsmandates us  eu every year almost  people are killed in motor vehicle accidents in the united states additionally these crashes cause  million nonfatal injuries and damage  million vehicles… adas alone has the potential to save society roughly  per car and fully autonomous cars could generate societal savings of as much as  per car sold when they have fully penetrated the market source bcg  mema research report no wonder that nhtsa national highway traffic safety administration continues to promote the adoption of the safety features the bcg  mema research report gives us the following additional facts since the  model year electronic stability control systems have been required for all new light vehicles and by model year  all light vehicles will be required to install a rearview camera system in addition nhtsa is in the process of updating the ncap to include aeb systems featuring two system types  crash imminent braking and dynamic brake support the agency is studying other adas features such as lane keeping assist but has not yet mandated these technologies there is more evidence for the beneficial regulation activity in  the us adopted new regulations for sideimpact protection which now have been fully phasedin china introduced a vehicle rating program in  and latin america introduced a similar program in  the united states upgraded its vehicle rating program in  and europe completed an upgrade of its euroncap rating system in  and has initiated a further upgrade which will be fully implemented by  there are also other plans for improved automotive safety both in these countries and many other countries that could affect the companys market thanks to more stringent crash ratings by institutes such as euroncap and the trends towards more automated vehicles we see a strong demand of more active safety sensors and software we also see vehicle manufacturers installing more airbags and more advanced seatbelt systems in their vehicles generally when new models are introduced the safety standards of vehicles are increasing in china india and other growth markets such as brazil partially due to new regulations and crash test rating programs for example the indian government has decided on a new traffic legalization that mandate more rigid crash test standards of light vehicles this should eventually lead to higher installation rate of airbags and more advanced seatbelts source autolivs annual report autoliv can definitely benefit from the broad implementation of such regulations they can help improve the second main driver of the companys sales  content per vehicle nysecpv ie value of the safety products in a vehicle it a is very important factor of success because growth of cpv enables the automotive safety market to grow faster than the light vehicles production business climate current products and future trends source bcg  mema research report regardless of future changes passive safety components will still be required to protect occupants in the event of a car crash it is a vital product line for autoliv because the passive safety segment is the biggest revenue source source companys financials authors dcf model nowadays the passive safety components market is the primary provider of lifesaving safety products in the world these products play a big role in emerging markets including fastgrowing china and india  in contrast to the active safety products autoliv is a global market leader both in airbags and seatbelts with the

signed an agreement to form a new jointlyowned company the new company will develop adas and ad systems for the use in volvo cars and for sale exclusively by autoliv to all oems the revenues will be shared by both companies operations are expected to start in the first half of  source autolivs annual report we can conclude that autoliv is not only a global market leader in the automotive safety in the present time but also has a solid foundation for longterm development financial standing according to the latest sp report as of october   autoliv inc has a corporate credit rating of astablea

apply the recent percentage of sales to forecasts capex stand at a level of  of revenue according to the managements plans it is higher than the average historical level of  the rest of the forecast

expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
