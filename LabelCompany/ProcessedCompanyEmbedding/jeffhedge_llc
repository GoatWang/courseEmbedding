behalf of the us environmental protection agency automotive electronics manufacturer edge products llc edge has agreed to pay a  civil penalty for manufacturing and selling electronic devices that allowed owners of model year  and later diesel pickup trucks to remove emission controls from their vehicles diesel trucks that are not equipped with emission controls known as “diesel particulate filters” emit excess particulate matter pm when running trucks without these types of controls leave behind a trail of dark black smoke pm is associated with a number of health problems including respiratory and cardiovascular disease chronic bronchitis decreased lung function and an increased risk of lung cancer settlement resources press release consent decree on this page overview of company violations injunctive relief pollutant impacts civil penalty comment contact overview of company edge products llc edge is an automotive electronics manufacturer based in ogden utah the company was founded in  the electronic devices at issue in this case were sold to authorized distributors and directly to individuals throughout the united states top of page violations federal law prohibits any vehicle or engine from being sold in the united states unless it is covered by a valid epaissued certificate of conformity indicating that the vehicle or engine meets applicable federal emission standards the law further prohibits anyone from manufacturing or selling any part that defeats or bypasses the emission controls that are used to meet the standards epa sets different emission standards for different types of vehicles and engines since  heavy duty diesel trucks must meet stringent emission standards for particulate matter pm and other pollutants under epa’s regulations at  cfr part  in order to meet these standards heavy duty diesel trucks generally must be equipped with an emission control device known as a diesel particulate filter dpf which collects and burns soot from the engine exhaust to ensure that the dpf functions properly it is continuously monitored by the truck’s computer if the truck’s computer detects a problem with the dpf or if it has been tampered with or removed the vehicle’s “check engine” light is illuminated and the vehicle may not operate properly between january  and april  edge manufactured and sold a variety of electronic devices intended for use with model year  and later gm ford and dodge diesel pickup trucks which allowed users to reprogram a truck’s computer so that the check engine light would not illuminate and the vehicle would continue to run even after the dpf had been completely removed in total edge sold more than  of these products nationwide under the edge racing brand name in doing so edge violated the provisions of title ii of the clean air act caa which prohibit the manufacture and sale of parts or components that defeat or bypass an emission control device that is installed on a motor vehicle top of page pollutant impacts pm especially fine particles consists of microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems pm is linked to a variety of problems including increased respiratory symptoms such as irritation of the airways coughing or difficulty breathing decreased lung function aggravated asthma and premature death in people with heart or lung disease epa estimates that the illegal devices sold by edge will result in  tons of excess pm emissions this is equivalent to the emissions from  new longhaul semi trucks operating for a period of  years top of page injunctive relief the settlement requires edge to do the following offer to buy back the illegal devices from anyone who possesses one in order to sell a device back to edge the truck from which the device came must be returned to its original factory programming and spend at least  to fund an emission mitigation project to offset the excess pm emissions resulting from the use of its devices the funds provided by edge will be offered as rebates to individuals who own old woodburning stoves and who wish to replace them with cleaner burning appliances such as new pellet stoves or epacertified wood stoves in selected geographic areas with severe pm pollution the rebate program will be implemented by an independent third party selected solely by edge further details about the rebate program including eligibility requirements will be available after the third party has been selected top of page civil
