life f itspmagazine connects with shehzad merchant gigamons chief technology officer about his role as cto for gigamon the value of culture in building out a cybersecurity program and the importance he and his company place on collaboration and innovation beyond traditional rd rolesitspmagazine can you please tell us a little bit about yourselfmerchant i serve as the chief technology officer at gigamon and have over  years of experience in the hightech industry prior to joining gigamon i served as the cto at extreme networks and authored several networking and communications patents i speak at various industry events including interop and open networking summit and have been engaged with many standards bodies including the ieee ietf and onf before extreme networks i was the cofounder and vp of products at polytime systems following on from various senior architectural and research roles at allied telesyn nevis networks and sri i have a masters degree in computer engineering from usc and an electronic engineering degree from university of mumbaiitspmagazine whats a recent accomplishment youd like to share with our readersmerchant our biggest recent team accomplishment has been building our security operation center soc at the gigamon offices operationalizing the soc and putting our own infrastructure in place has been a huge success for our technology development team it has not only given us the ability to mirror our customers’ toughest cybersecurity network visibility problems but also find solutions and test them out before bringing a finished product to market through that we now have the ability to service out different threats and more quickly innovate for our customersfrom a more personal perspective culture is something that can never change unless it is embraced from the top it must be reflected by all the members of the executive team and for gigamon our goal is to have a culture that enables collaboration and innovation we strive for this kind of environment across the entire company so that every person in the office can jump in and solve challenging issues without concern about being tied to different teams or projects it fosters a very positive work environment an example of this is our infosec and it teams traditionally these two groups are at odds and always pushing against each other because their priorities are different at gigamon we have tried to bridge that gap through our own practices creating a model where it and infosec teams work in a frictionless manner by providing them with the tools they need to accomplish their goalsitspmagazine what inspires and motivates you to do what you domerchant inspiration really comes from deep inside it’s sewn into your dna i’ve found that i’ve continued to be inspired by people who think outside the box and have a different perspective on how to solve problems they are the people that don’t say “solve this problem by doing x y z” they are the people that say “why is there a problem” thinking this way creates an environment to work hard have integrity and be creative which is where my biggest source of inspiration comes fromi am continuously motivated knowing that i have the ability to make a difference at gigamon but also across the broader industry right now the cybersecurity industry is facing numerous challenges but along with those challenges are opportunities to actually make things better and help enterprise and public sectors keep their infrastructure safer and secure cyber attackers currently have the upper hand but i think we are at a point where we can leverage technology to shift that advantage back to the defender in   or  years from now the security industry can look back and say “this was a time when cybersecurity shifted” it is really motivating to me to think gigamon is a part of such a significant changeitspmagazine how would you describe your impact on societymerchant at gigamon we continuously try to find ways to reach out to our community and drive support in the cybersecurity industry we recently partnered with uc irvine as part of their cybersecurity initiative it is a group that is utilizing the most cuttingedge technologies for research in cybersecurity and gigamon is sponsoring that initiative our company really believes that there is a lot of interesting work being done at universities and that partnering with schools and giving them a place to showcase talented students will ultimately benefit the industry gigamon also runs a very effective internship program where we bring in students from all over the country and give them an opportunity to work in a fastpaced exciting environment while also giving them the freedom to think independentlygigamon also runs an internal annual global innovation fair this fair is not just open to rd and technology employees it is open to anybody at the company to bring ideas that can be implemented into our products through this we are hoping to encourage innovation and thought leadership all levels across the organization you never know who may have the next big idea that could change the game for our customersitspmagazine whats one final thing about the work youve done that youd like your colleagues peers friends and family to knowmerchant something that changed my perspective on security was when my son was in th grade and he would hack into and jam our home network while he was doing it to get my attention when i was working at home it was definitely an eyeopener he could hack into the network so easily by downloading some readilyavailable software seeing the democratization of malware in my own home was very shocking and just proved how easily available this software is that even a th grader could do it that happened about two years ago and had an impact on the genesis of our whole security delivery platform it shifted my perspective on who we address and how we view security challengesabout shehzad

steps to succeed in merchant services sales every day we speak to potential agents who ask us how they can be successful when selling credit card processing  there are a lot of factors but we have laid out the top  for you below  follow these and you will be on your way to a six figure income in the merchant services sales field   join the right iso this is the single most important factor  you need to work with a company that will not only support you but will also deliver on their promises to you and your clients  look the company up on the bbb rip off report wwwtopcreditcardprocessorratingcom and wwwcardpaymentoptionscom  if they have bad ratings it is for a reason  they either do not deliver on their promises to the client the merchant account sales agent or both  we have one of the top rated iso agent programs in the country  but shop around  see whats out there  then come back and contact us to learn more about what makes us different    learn your product working as a merchant services sales agent is very competitive  you need to make sure that you have as much knowledge as possible when you hit the field  you can learn most of what you need to know through your iso agent program training portal or from your manager at your iso  if you ask your manager a question and they dont know the answer then that is a red flag that you are not working for the right company  learn as much as you can and never stop learning  the credit card processing is changing rapidly and you need to keep up to date in order to compete   set a schedule for yourself one of the more difficult parts of working as an independent sales agent in the merchant account field is taking responsibility for your daily actions  you are your own boss and your success is  dictated by your schedule  write it up daily and stick to it  for example  from am cold call over the phone from am to pm cold call in the field have an appointment set for  every day then finish your day following up with old clients  this works for most people  but you really need to work the schedule that best fits your needs  if you do not plan your day you may get caught up in one activity and your entire day can go to waste  plan ahead for success  sample schedule that we suggest you use   referrals referrals referrals this is the single most important way you can grow your business  cold calling sucks  period  there is no way around it  you have to do it in the beginning of your career  but you wont have to do it forever you need to set a pattern for how you interact and follow up with clients in order to get the most referrals you can from every one  first  when you are signing up a new client  set the expectation that you will be coming back in for referrals after you prove your self to them  second  after your client has been with you for a full month complete reverse cost comparison to show them the savings you generated  finally  bring hte cost comparison in to them and ask them for specific referrals  who is their doctor veterinarian mechanic etc  do not ask who they know  ask them specific questions to get specific answers  these  steps wont guarantee your success in the merchant services field  but  they will absolutely help you take the right steps to success  if you would like to learn more about a career with beacon payments click the link  beacon payments careers nameemailphonecomments optional beacon payments  stop cold calling and start making more sales  home blog stop cold calling and start making more sales stop cold calling and start making more sales published  the majority of the sales people at our company work outside in door to door sales  this is hands down one of the hardest ways you can build a book of business in any industry  it is time consuming exhausting and the negativity that comes with being told no many times daily can lead a person to look for a new career  but   there is a better way to sell if you are a rookie in sales im going to give you some bad news right now  you will need to start off with a lot cold calling in order to build up a pipeline  but you wont have to forever so  what is the magic plan to grow your business and sell more deals than anyone else in your company  its all about scheduling traditionally sales people have been taught that they need to leave their office and go grind  spend  hours walking door to door  hit every door and every floor  talk to everyone  this is not the answer though  working hard is not always enough to make someone successful   you need to work smart as well you need to set up your day so part of it is spent cold calling this part will get smaller and smaller as you grow your database of potential clients part of it is spent at appointments and part of it is spent on referrals  this is what a typical day should look like for any outside sales person   am  am spend the morning reaching out to potential customers that you have not had a chance to sit down with yet via the phone  you have spent time collecting their information   most likely cold calling and pulling their business card or just their name and when the best time is to contact them  now you are going to reach out to them to try to set up an appointment to sit down with them  a typical script would be  i was in the other day to speak to you about x  i helped some of your neighbors with x and i would like to come in and speak with you for  minutes on tuesday at pm  then handle any rejections or rebuttals that come your way  always offer them a time when you are going to be near them  never ask them what time is good  they will always say they have no time  you are going to suggest either  am or pm  hit those calls for  hours and start setting as many appointments as you can   am  you are going to have your first of  daily appointments at this time  hit the area before and after in any spare time you have to do some cold callingcollecting of information so you can reach out to people the next day during you phone session   pm  the middle of the day  lunch  a great time to sit down with an existing client and ask for referrals bring them something to eat   and most importantly  ask for referrals  the most important part of your day will be getting those referrals and then calling them to set up a meeting  nothing is more powerful than calling someone up and saying that their friend told you to call  people will give you their attention twice as often on a referral than they will on a cold call  once you have enough clients you should be constantly going to these lunch meetings and working on referrals  just to be clear  his does not mean asking who they know  ask for a very specific type of person or business that you are trying to work with for example i am looking to work with people in the medical field who is your doctor or dentist and can i reach out to them   pm  this will be your second appointment of the day  spend time cold calling around this appointment and information gathering   pm  get out of the field  go home and wrap up your day and start organizing and preparing for the next day  in sales your day does not truly end at pm   you should spend time after the work day getting ready for the next day  this is what makes the difference between someone earning  a year and someone earning  a year if you follow this simple plan you will effectively cut your time cold calling down from  hours a day to maybe  hours max there will be days where you wont even be doing any  you will eventually hit a point where almost all of your business will be coming from appointments and referrals  stick to this schedule and keep track of your daily activity and sales will be much less stressful you will be happier and you will make a ton more money  if you are looking to start a lucrative career and earn a six figure income please let us know tags cold calling independent sales independent sales

retiree increases income by selling merchant services  home blog retiree increases income by selling merchant services retiree increases income by selling merchant services published  recently we have seen an influx of retired salespeople contacting us looking to reenter the workforce  we are more than happy to speak to them as their years of experience can translate well into being a successful outside sales person  selling merchant card services is a sales job that does not require experience  but if someone comes to us with a lot of it we are not going to give them a chance to succeed a year ago we hired a gentleman in the midwest who had retired  years ago and was living on social security  his checks were just enough to pay his bills  but he wanted something more  after almost a year of searching for a sales job he had no luck  he contacted us knowing that while we could not guarantee him a salary  we could give him an opportunity to increase his income substantially on his own timeframe after explaining that selling merchant services is one of the last ways to build a residual income in this country he decided to give us a shot  his first month selling was tough  it had been a while since he had done any outside sales and he had to reaquaint himself with dealing with rejection  he kept at it though knowing that every no was one step closer to a yes and he was just spending his days filling up his pipeline six months later he had brought on over  clients and was earning a monthly residual of over   while it doesnt sound like much he was almost doubling his social security payment and if he decided he did not want to go out and sell any more he would continue to earn this residual as long as his clients continue to process credit cards with us fortunately he was not happy with only  a month in residual income  he kept at it and a year later he has brought in over  clients  his residual is now over  a month  if he decides to lay back and take a few months off he will continue to earn  a year like i said  selling merchant card services is one of the last ways to earn a great residual income  if you would like to learn more please click
