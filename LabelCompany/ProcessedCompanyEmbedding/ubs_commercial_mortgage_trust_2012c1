because the transactions key metrics including moodys loantovalue ltv ratio moodys stressed debt service coverage ratio dscr and the transactions herfindahl index herf are within acceptable ranges the ratings on three pi classes were upgraded primarily due to a significant increase in defeasance which increased to  of the current pool balance from  at the last review as well as an increase in overall pool performance the ratings on the io classes classes xa and xb were affirmed based on the credit performance or the weighted average rating factor or warf of the referenced classes moodys

lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool loan concentration an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls methodology underlying

moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  compared to a herf of  at the last review deal performance as of

driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  compared to a herf of  at moodys last review when the herf falls below  moodys uses the excelbased large loan model and then reconciles and weights the results from the conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation the large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loanlevel proceeds derived from moodys loanlevel ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage loan structure and property type moodys also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations deal performance as of the january   distribution date

identifies each affected issuer ratings rationale please click on this link httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf for the list of affected credit ratings this list is an integral part of this press release and provides for each of the credit ratings covered moodys disclosures on the following items principal methodologies the upgrades of eight cmbs io classes and the downgrades of  cmbs io classes follow the publication of moodys approach to rating structured finance interestonly io securities published on  june  the updated io methodology and reflect the rating impact of our updated approach incorporating performance information as of the may  remittance dates the updated methodology modifies moodys approach to rating io securities referencing multiple bonds and single or multiple collateral pools with realized losses references made to the exclusion of certain io securities in the previous methodology were removed in addition a description was added to explain when an io bond is viewed as having effectively matured and results in the withdrawal of the rating the updated methodology explains that moodys will limit the rating of an io security to no more than five notches above the rating of the lowest credit quality reference bond or the rating that would be assigned based on an assessment of the default probability of the reference pools as applicable and clarifies that the collateral pools default probability typically will be treated as equivalent to casf if a loss is expected on the pool the methodology also explains how moodys year idealised cumulative loss rates table will be used to determine the rating of ios referencing multiple bonds and ios backed by single or multiple pools as well as how the table is used when the loss falls between two rating categories this press release is not intended to provide a summary of the methodology for a full explanation of the methodology please consult the updated report now available on wwwmoodyscom and accessible at httpswwwmoodyscomresearchmoodysupdatesitsapproachforratingstructuredfinanceinterestonlypr ratings on  of the interestonly classes from  deals were withdrawn due to the excess spread due on the io bond being reduced to zero and are treated as having effectively matured the upgrades of eight cmbs io classes were due to the modification of moodys approach to rating io securities referencing multiple bonds including wac ios to the weighted average of the current credit quality of all referenced bonds based on current balances grossed up for realized losses subject to the constraint of no more than five notches above the lowest credit quality referenced bond the downgrades on  cmbs io classes were due to i the rating limit of an io security to no more than five notches above the lowest credit quality referenced bond ii the use of moodys year idealised cumulative loss rates table to determine the rating of ios referencing multiple bonds and the mapping to the next lower category when the loss falls between two rating categories and iii principal paydowns of higher quality reference classes as of the may  remittance statements factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings an io class may be subject to ratings upgrades if there is an improvement in the credit quality of its referenced classes subject to the limits and provisions of the updated io methodology an io class may be subject to ratings downgrades if there is i a decline in the credit quality of the reference classes andor ii paydowns of higher quality reference classes subject to the limits and provisions of the updated io methodology regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis
