relations recycling technology imagine countless foot high mounds of textile waste waiting to be picked up from busy clothing factories endless years of garbage trucks picking up and then dumping all this trash over and over not a pretty picture nor a healthy solution for the landfills that it will end up rotting in now imagine that all these garbage trucks suddenly cease to make their routine visits to these factories  instead a different kind of truck pulls in and collects all that seemingly worthless waste hauls it over to a place where that same textile waste is cleaned scoured stripped of color and eventually returned to its original form its true it’s finally happening  imagination inspires transformation as the pioneer behind this new process of rethinking textile waste code green apparel is proudly driving our industry away from landfills and transforming the apparel industry for good saving water cotton is one of the worlds thirstiest crops and most desirable textiles but it takes hundreds and sometimes thousands of gallons of water to grow enough cotton to manufacture a single shirt or even one pair of jeans our technology of recycling preconsumer textile waste significantly reduces the amount of water that is traditionally wasted during the intensive process of growing cotton in the fields and code green apparel doesn’t just recycle cotton out of those foot high mounds of textile waste we also breathe new life into polyester and other blends of fabric as well better apparel once the textile waste has been returned to its original form it is then handled no differently than any other textile would be treated at an ordinary garment manufacturer our recycled apparel looks feels and performs identically to any nonrecycled piece of clothing the yarns we weave and the fabric we sew are subjected to the same industry standards and the employees of your company wont notice any difference with their fresh green apparel but there is a difference in that new company uniform of theirs a big difference because what you wear matters it matters now more than ever since responsible companies across the globe all share in companywide sustainability initiatives that hold us all to that same rising standard these environmental views can now be both supported and worn in the form of better apparel with a conscience  code green apparel the right shade of green sustainability companies are proving that it makes sense to their operations and our environment change of this sort within companies is both noble in effort and rewarding for our communities but executives know all too well that implementing sustainability initiatives may ultimately doom the financial sustainability of their very own business model in the face of this challenge going green continues to be a major priority for many companies but it needs to be it has to be the right shade of green we not only support the sustainability initiatives of companies

way to change there i was parked in the driveway of my home along with my yearold son in the backseat still fastened with his seatbelt on as i was just about to step out from behind the wheel my son luke asked me a question that i didn’t have an answer for… a question posed to me some six years ago that today now finds me sharing this very letter with you he simply asked me why not luke and i had just returned from our areas recycling center which featured a shared lesson from dad as to why we needed to make the effort to deposit our cans bottles and papers he got the lesson so much that as we sat there parked in our driveway he said that we should be recycling everything i quickly dispelled his notion and said well maybe not everything and then this kid so boldly asked why not youre absolutely right luke at the very least we sure can try to having been in the apparel industry for over  years i couldnt help recalling the mindboggling amounts of waste and filth that my industry had created and that maybe just maybe i could help find a way to bridge the disconnect between our environment and the clothing industry now with the help of a handful of brave visionaries we have taken a bold first step with code green apparel “heres to the kid in all of us that will always dare to ask why not in witnessing the profound sustainability initiatives launched by countless fortune  companies i respect how the leadership of these organizations has placed a high value on inspiring their employees to remain engaged in their environmental principles with the challenge of integrating sustainability programs measuring their effectiveness and delivering continued value to stakeholders these global companies are the pioneers that light the trail of responsibility for respecting our
