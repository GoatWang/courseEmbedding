chief executive officer  director thanks christiane and welcome everyone to our third quarter  earnings call ill provide an overview of our q performance and share some insights about the business and our preparations for q before turning the call over to brian for a financial review and an update to our full year  outlook we delivered strong operational and financial performance during the third quarter as we continued to delight our customers across our portfolio of premium lifestyle brands and execute on the growing opportunity that lies ahead of us in our enterprise business with the holiday season in front of us we remain singularly focused on fulfilling our mission of making the world a better place by helping people share lifes joy and the memories and sentiments of the holiday season provide us a unique opportunity to strengthen that mission with our outstanding lineup of products services and user experiences the team is prepared to handle this holiday seasons expected record order volumes during the third quarter we delivered healthy growth on a number of key financial metrics customers orders revenue adjusted ebitda free cash flow and the ongoing efficient return of capital through share repurchases both revenue and gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance operating expenses were slightly lower than planned and adjusted ebitda and free cash flow exceeded expectations our results once again demonstrate leverage in our model as profitability metrics improved and we expect margin improvement will accelerate as we enter into our seasonally strong fourth quarter accordingly as brian will discuss in more detail we are increasing our adjusted ebitda free cash flow free cash flow per share and eps guidance for the year revenue was  million up  versus last year and at the high end of our guidance range representing our th consecutive quarter of yearoveryear net revenue growth our consumer business grew  to  million and our enterprise business doubled to  million versus the third quarter last year our shutterfly brand continued to demonstrate doubledigit organic growth while our smaller brands continued to lag in line with our expectations as we discussed last quarter our enterprise segment generated significant growth this quarter benefiting from the contract we signed with a fortune  company at the end of the second quarter which has the potential to generate up to  million over seven years the success we are seeing in our enterprise business further reinforces our belief that the investments weve been making in the enterprise platform are already paying off and that additional growth opportunities exist for us to better utilize our fixed assets we also completed the last piece of our facilities consolidation and restructuring in the third quarter and celebrated the opening of our third stateoftheart facility in tempe arizona at the end of august on time and below budget as we discussed in previous quarters we closed two other arizona locations and our elmsford new york production facility as a reminder we estimated the restructuring charges for facility consolidation would be  million to  million for the year and they came in within that range all material facility restructuring activity is now completed and we expect profitability and margin to show improvement this q and next year as we lap our manufacturing infrastructure investments our customer and order growth also reached record highs for the third quarter customers and orders across all brands grew  and  respectively this resulted in a record  million unique customers generating  million orders across all of our lifestyle brands excluding groovebook which operates with a  monthly subscription model and our discontinued treat brand customers grew  and orders grew  while average order value decreased roughly  to  the third quarter is typically slower than other quarters due to the lack of any gift giving holiday and results reflect higher promotional activity following our normal pricing and promotional pattern in q in order to generate additional buying activity and consumer engagement leading into the allimportant fourth quarter we are pleased with the progress we made in broadening our demographic and customer reach driven by our improved mobile capabilities and continued expansion of new product selections we are seeing a material increase in customer spend by millennials who now comprise approximately  of our active customers separately we formally entered the hispanic market with the release of spanish language cards and stationery including customization options spanish characters and spanishspeaking customer service along with a new partnership with actress maria canalsbarrera to bring awareness to our new offering moving on to shutterfly  as a reminder we announced our plan earlier this year to build the next generation of shutterfly and create a worldclass memory management service connected to the smartest personalized ecommerce solutions with a planned rollout in mid our goals with shutterfly  are to build a next gen commerce platform to innovate faster launch more products and service categories further our mobile creation and engagement capabilities and bring our awardwinning creation paths to wherever peoples photos are there are five main components to shutterfly  first to provide a nextgeneration photo service we are bringing thislife directly into shutterflycom while also consolidating our mobile apps we believe that by bringing the photo curation capabilities of thislife together with the product creation capabilities of shutterfly we will enable a richer customer experience and higher conversion rates and revenue having one service one site one set of apps and one wellknown brand will drive greater usage and monetization second shutterfly  will provide the ability for us to partner more deeply with other photo sharing sites allowing customers to create great products and oneofakind gifts wherever their pictures are stored third increase our mobile footprint and capabilities revenue from mobile sources grew over  yearoveryear this past quarter reaching  of shutterfly brand revenue during the quarter we launched a universal ios app with new designs and features including throwback and auto upload which further reduces the friction from uploading photos manually and we expanded the product assortment within our mobile app all leading to the plus growth fourth reduce the number of technology platforms we manage thus driving quicker time to market for new features while lowering operating cost and complexity this aspect of shutterfly  will take a little longer as we decided to further modernize the core shutterfly platform by building shared service apis before migrating tiny prints and wpd over to our new platform this will allow us to add additional features and functionality to tp and wpd and hopefully revenue throughout  and lastly to expand internationally through a modernized efficient multicurrency multilanguage technology platform turning now to the allimportant holiday season as you know preparing for q is a major endeavor across all areas of our business including product and services marketing manufacturing technology finance human resources and customer service and our teams are better prepared than any other time in my  years at shutterfly we have innovative new products to delight our customers including solutions themed innovations such as the recently launched make my

stationary brand we are encouraging our customers to send something spectacular this holiday season we are showcasing great breadth in innovation in our card assortment which we believe will meaningfully stand out against our competitors first glitter cards that keep the glitter on the cards not your floor second envelopes with cuttingedge new designs and options for a full recipient experience and solutions via multiple design choices such as new fold leaf backup card layouts with a printed return address on the back and envelope liners that add a final personal touch to every

gap partnership we continue to expand our brand impressions and reach in advance of the holidays through our integrated marketing campaign and our strategic partnerships with leading brands such as

shutterfly finally we will continue to test and scale tv and radio ads for shutterfly and we will soon be dropping our largest annual holiday catalog campaign ever for the shutterfly and tiny prints brands featuring all of our exciting new products and designs q readiness on the product side wouldnt be anything without the loyal support of our manufacturing and our customer service teams we are gearing up to increase our manufacturing staff while executing against numerous scale efficiency programs we recently upgraded to a new virtual language software program to handle call volumes more efficiently and effectively while hopefully creating even higher customer satisfaction during our upcoming holiday peak i couldnt be more pleased with the progress our team has made in q and the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter now ill turn it over to brian for a more detailed review of our financials and outlook brian brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill begin with some observations about our third quarter performance key metrics and operating results ill then conclude with an update to our q and full year  financial guidance before opening the call up for your questions earlier today we posted third quarter results that met or exceeded our expectations in nearly every financial metric total revenue of  million was up  yearoveryear coming in at the high end of our guidance range led by continued solid growth at our shutterfly flagship brand and very strong performance in our enterprise business led by the new multiyear client contract that jeff discussed earlier q consumer revenue was up  to  million and enterprise revenue was up  to  million accounting for  of our total revenues this quarter as jeff mentioned earlier excluding groovebook and treat average order value or aov for the quarter was down  to  aov continues to reflect the ongoing strength and over delivery of our photo gift products and mobile channel as well as end of quarter pricing and promotional strategies plan to generate greater consumer engagement leading into our q seasonal peak gaap gross margin in the third quarter was  at the high end of our guidance range of  to  despite the fact that enterprise revenue which carries lower gross margins grew significantly faster than consumer revenue in the quarter and that consumer margin was impacted by a number of significant events in the third quarter on a yearoveryear basis such as lapping the opening of our shakopee minnesota facility and completing the nonrecurring arizona consolidation costs and the shutdown costs of our elmsford new york facility the enterprise gross margin itself improved from scale benefits and the new client contracts while the consumer margin was lower due to the nonrecurring facility charges i just mentioned and greater product mix of photo gift and home décor products which historically have been largely fulfilled through outsourced partners at a lower margin we continue to expect more normalized yearoveryear gross margin comparisons to begin this q operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation totaled  million up  yearoveryear breaking opex down further technology and development costs totaled  million for the quarter up  over prioryear or  of net revenues down slightly from  compared to q of last year excluding stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization our technology and development spending totaled  million up  from the prior year our technology costs were lower as a percentage of revenue primarily due to lower head count and savings from the colocation data center move to las vegas completed in q of  sales and marketing expenses totaled  million for the quarter or  of net revenues down from  in q of last year excluding stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization sales and marketing expense increased  to  million sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue were lower due to some timing shifts of costs into early q offset slightly by the rising cost of media and advertising for many of our consumer marketing channels general and administrative expense for the quarter totaled  million or  of net revenues down from  in q of last year excluding stockbased comp credit card processing fees depreciation and amortization ga expenses totaled  million up  from the prior year now that most of our nonrecurring restructuring and proxy events are mostly behind us yeartodate we have incurred roughly  million in nonrecurring charges which is favorable to our previous expectations by a few million dollars due to more efficient shutdown costs and consolidation of our various facilityrelated initiatives ill provide a fullyear outlook in a few moments operating loss for the quarter was  million well ahead of guidance for a loss of  million to  million or more than  better than the midpoint of our expectations and the pretax loss was  million after factoring in noncash interest expense on our convertible notes turning to our profitability metrics the adjusted ebitda loss for q was only  million a  improvement over the prior year and  million better than the midpoint of our guidance our tax rate for the quarter was significantly impacted by the better than expected operating loss and therefore we reversed and trued up a tax benefit we had taken in the first half based on lower pretax expectations this overperformance resulted in us accruing a tax provision instead of a benefit this quarter resulting in an effective tax rate for the third quarter of negative  compared to guidance of a tax benefit of  to  this trueup negatively impacted our inquarter eps by nearly  per share for q but it will normalize for the full year and our guidance today incorporates the fullyear impact gaap net loss for the quarter was  million or  per share without the  impact of the tax reversal gaap net loss would have been  per share or nearly  per share better than the midpoint of our guidance normalizing for the impact of our convertible note offering on our earnings per share nongaap net loss was  million or  per share on a weighted average share count of  million shares the share count came in slightly lower than our guidance of  million shares as we continued to execute on our previously authorized  million stock repurchase plan shutterfly repurchased  million shares in q at an average price of  for a total of  million the accelerated stock repurchase transaction we previously disclosed in q is included in that total that brings our total repurchases over the past  months to nearly  million or  million shares at an average price of  we have approximately  million of authorized repurchase capacity remaining capital expenditures during the quarter totaled  million including  million for technology equipment and software  million in capitalized software development costs  million for manufacturing and building improvements and  for rental equipment for the yeartodate period through september  capital expenditures totaled  million down nearly  compared to  million for the comparable period last year cash and total investments as of september  totaled  million due to the improvements in both adjusted ebitda and capex yeartodate free cash flow totaled a negative  million at the end of the third quarter an improvement of approximately  compared to a negative  million for the comparable period last year and this favorable free cash flow trend is expected to continue into our most important fourth quarter period which leads me to conclude my remarks with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year guidance for the fourth quarter we expect net revenues to range from  million to  million which reflects yearoveryear growth of up to  we expect our gaap gross margin to range from  to  of net revenues which at the midpoint will be up  basis points yearoveryear as we begin to fully normalize our comparisons lap our most significant capacity investments from last year and start to realize the operating leverage and returns we have been discussing over the past few years we also expect operating income to range from  million to  million we estimate our adjusted ebitda for q will range from  million to  million and that our gaap effective tax rate will range between  and  we expect gaap net income per share to range from  per share to  per share based on approximately  million shares outstanding based on our yeartodate results and outlook we are increasing our guidance for the year for adjusted ebitda operating income gaap eps and nongaap eps free cash flow and free cash flow per share while lowering the guidance for weighted shares outstanding and capital expenditures we are reiterating our guidance for revenue of  billion to  billion and our gross margin range of  to  of net revenues we are raising adjusted ebitda to  to  of net revenues compared to  in  operating income guidance is increasing to  million to  million excluding the impact of the nonrecurring restructuring and proxy costs of  million to  million our operating income would range from  million to  million or up nearly  times over  operating income of  million at the guidance midpoint and adjusted ebitda margin would be  to  of net revenues or  million at our guidance midpoint up  or more than  million over  adjusted ebitda dollars we now expect the effective tax rate for  to increase to  to  we expect gaap eps to range from a loss of  to a loss of  or on a nongaap basis adjusted for the impact of the convertible note from a negative  to a positive  excluding the impact of the nonrecurring charges of  million to  million plus depreciation on a nonrecurring basis of  million our gaap eps guidance would range from positive  to  per share we now expect a lower weighted average share count of approximately  million shares and finally we expect  capital expenditures will finish lower from  to  of net revenues down from the third quarter guidance for  of  to  of net revenues this results in a revised outlook of fullyear free cash flow to range from  million to  million up approximately  yearoveryear at the midpoint and our outlook for free cash flow per share is now even higher from  to  per share or up  yearoveryear at the midpoint and improved by  per share over our previous guidance of  per share with that ill turn the call back to jeff for some closing comments before opening the call up for questions jeff jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director thanks brian were entering the last two months in a very good position we have great products stateoftheart manufacturing facilities strategically located for optimal coverage of the united states and we are staffed and ready for q this year we expect to reach two key milestones more than  billion in annual revenues and more than  million in free cash flow our free cash flow alone is more than the annual revenue generated by most of our competitors our margins are showing improvement and we are executing on our vision for the future to be the leader in digital memory management and commerce we have tremendous opportunities ahead and the team is energized before we take your questions i want to take a moment to acknowledge the news of our cfo transition in the k that we filed earlier today as you may have seen by now our cfo brian regan is starting a new chapter in his career and moving on from shutterfly into private equity on behalf of the board and the management team i want to thank brian for his partnership and contributions over the past threeplus years and we wish him the very best in his new endeavor im thrilled to welcome mike pope to the team who is listening to the call and will be officially joining shutterfly this week mike brings deep financial and operational experience as cfo coo and ceo in private and public companies including several with manufacturing divisions brian will be working with mike on a smooth transition during the next few weeks under the cfo we have built a strong finance leadership team and look forward to mike further scaling our capabilities lastly id like to give you a quick update on the progress weve made regarding a new proposal for the employee compensation and incentive plan the compensation committee unanimously recommended and the board of directors unanimously approved an approach to seek shareholder approval for additional shares in our employee stock plan we look forward to discussing the new proposal with both the buy side and sell side in early  operator we are now ready to open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of paul bieber of merrill lynch your line is open please go ahead paul judd bieber  bank of america merrill lynch hi guys thanks for taking my questions first off the consumer business i think it was singledigit growth for the first time in a while i was hoping youd give some color around just whats driving that singledigit growth and then as we head into the fourth quarter how should we think about the mix of enterprise revenue versus consumer revenue and then separately the enterprise gross margins are very strong how should we think about enterprise gross margins generally going forward jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director great thanks paul its jeff so consumer revenue for the shutterfly brand grew double digits organically during the quarter and we were pleased with the strength in our biggest brand as our awareness continues to grow the product assortment continues to expand and our cohort curves remain very stable the weakness in consumer continue to be on the smaller brands which was driven by several factors a reduction in investment on those brands particularly in feature functionality and tech and dev a shifting of marketing resources on those brands and increased competition from smaller players who are nonprofitably buying market share during a seasonally slow third quarter as we head into the fourth quarter given the strength in our core brand and the fact that tiny prints is largely a cards and stationery brand who does more than shutterfly does in its annual revenue in the fourth quarter we are optimistic about reacceleration of growth in the consumer going into the fourth quarter as it relates to enterprise great results coming out of the enterprise team sales were up  yearoveryear and this new contract that we signed with a fortune  company has a number of components to it but overall lifted the profitability for that segment during the quarter and we believe will continue to allow for increased margin in our enterprise business over the coming years and as we continue investment in that enterprise platform and we complete that that will allow us to go out to other verticals and hopefully continue to acquire large clients paul judd bieber  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you and best of luck brian on your new endeavor brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you paul operator thank you our next question comes from the line of youssef squali of cantor your line is open please go ahead naved a khan  cantor fitzgerald securities yeah thanks this is actually naved khan for youssef congratulations guys on the quarter and brian good luck on the move just a couple of questions on the consumer side i think you guys talked about some weakness in the smaller brands and i just wanted to dig into that a little bit more so how much of that slowdown in the smaller brand is because of the fact that you sort of reduced the investments and  competition and then i had a followup jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yes so hard to parse the investments versus the competition but as i said in my prepared remarks around shutterfly  our goal is to get to one unified modern global efficient tech platform and what we started out doing in  was migrating the tiny prints and wedding paper divas technology stack onto the shutterfly stack as my new cto and my architecture team and my engineering team dug into that approach they came back and put forth a recommendation that we modernize the shutterfly stack first and then build a shared service model where wed then migrate the platform the tiny prints and wedding paper divas platform in the future so thats going to allow us to reinvest in feature functionality going into  which should drive improvement in the revenue growth rate on those smaller brands and then well come back in  and be able to get some efficiencies from this new api shared service model so hard for us to parse competition versus our own investment but certainly the reduction in our investment had a – impact on the growth of the smaller brands naved a khan  cantor fitzgerald securities okay and then i think jeff you mentioned that some of the marketing – maybe it was brian – some of the marketing spend was pushed out from q into q but at the same time if i look at the customer growth it came in really strong so i wonder if you saw some opportunities to acquire customers toward the end of the quarter and you decided to take that and therefore the marketing spend – or how would you – can you just provide some more color on that jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yes so its not uncommon for us to see some of the planned marketing spend in q move to q that happened almost every year ive been here but with the strength of our partnerships because of our brand position and our market share we did a lot more through our partnerships and some free trial and some of the flash coupon sites like groupon and that allow us to acquire more customers so we didnt need to spend hard marketing dollars in the quarter so were keeping those in reserve as we enter into the seasonally strong fourth quarter and well be able to put more dollars to work against our integrated marketing campaign so thats why you saw a reduction of about  in aov if you normalize for groove book that was because we were giving away some free product towards the end of the quarter to get customers back into the fold for them to upload more photos for them to receive their product in q and be top of mind awareness as we enter into the busy season brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president and that is exactly why we do some of those endofquarter promotions we are generating some customer activity that may not yet fully translate into revenue which we fully expect to reengage for the fourth quarter and that is assumed in the guidance weve given today for the fourth quarter revenues naved a khan  cantor fitzgerald securities got it okay and then one final question if i may i know i said the last one was going to be the last question but i promise this one would be so on the enterprise side we know that fourth quarter tends to be pretty tight in terms of capacity and i guess between thanksgiving and christmas you probably are  to capacity so as we think about how enterprise can do in this quarter we just saw  kind of growth in the third quarter how should we model it out if we had to think about it jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yeah so couple of things one a large part of the reason why we opened a new  square foot facility in shakopee minnesota last year and a  square foot facility in tempe arizona this year was to be able to accommodate the growth of enterprise during all quarters including the fourth quarter enterprise also works on slightly different – not entirely – but slightly different machinery and so with our temporary hiring were able to both staff the labor as well as our capacity to be able to serve the needs of our enterprise clients simultaneously and delivering on our consumer business so we feel good about the capacity and with the current footprint of our three stateoftheart modern plants in south carolina minnesota and arizona we believe we have capacity to do towards  million in annual revenue for enterprise with the current facility infrastructure as we think about the fourth quarter given that  or roughly thereof revenue for consumer occurs in that quarter you would expect consumer to have a greater weighting of the total revenue in the fourth quarter than it does in the third quarter brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president and then also there is going to be some outsourcing of enterprise that would occur more often than not in that fourth quarter when weve got the consumer business being more done inhouse so the favorable margin trends that you saw in the third quarter for enterprise wont continue to that same extent in the fourth quarter and thats incorporated into our guidance naved a khan  cantor fitzgerald securities thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of colin sebastian of robert w baird your line is open please go ahead colin a sebastian  robert w baird  co inc broker thanks good afternoon and first off brian sorry to see you go but best of luck to you and welcome to mike couple of questions on the business first one of the larger european players was acquired recently at i think a doubledigit ebitda multiple and i wonder if you had a chance to look at the books why that wasnt a fit and might that deal change your strategy or timing for expansion into new markets and i have a followup jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director sure so we are aware of that deal it looks like it traded at x current ev to ebitda keep in mind that they dont take on storage because of the privacy laws in europe so part of our value proposition has been free unlimited storage for our customers and that has been part of why we have more than  of the market share and so slightly different market in which youre playing so it has a lower capital intensity than the usbased business and so when you normalize for those things its about a x current were trading at about x so the difference represents a control premium plus a lower capital intensity as we talked about shutterfly  vision on the call one of the five key components is to build a modern global technology platform that will allow us to take shutterfly and our family of brands beyond just north america and so as we roll out and continue to invest over the next  months to  months on the shutterfly  vision that will allow us the ability to compete on a global basis colin a sebastian  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks and then secondly down that – jeff a broader question in terms of the source of new consumer segment customers and the mix of millennials that you referenced on the call are the majority of your new customers now in the younger cohorts that have essentially skipped the offline channels altogether and what are the spending and engagement patterns that youre seeing from newer users compared to the older cohorts thanks jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director sure were excited about the new subsegments in which were able to attract into the family of brands millennials as i indicated was about  of active customers on shutterfly mobile was up  yearoveryear and weve made a concerted launch into the hispanic and latino market which represents a very fastgrowing demographic in america so we believe those investments while already paying off will continue to do so in the future as you look at the spending patterns of customers what we have said is were seeing a slightly lower aov on mobile because today were not really pushing photo books on a smartphone and we dont offer the ability to make cards and stationery on a smartphone today those are part of the shutterfly  replatforming effort and as youve seen from both google and apple that tablet sales are down to about  yearoveryear growth so people are either using a very small screen or a very large screen and were playing in both of those millennials are not just going exclusively online they are walking into retail and theyre doing some purchases in retail what we want to do is build the shutterfly  vision that aggregates their images across any device any ecosystems and allows the power of our creation paths to go wherever their photos go and part of the replatforming will allow us to bring the entire catalog of products and services on shutterflycom to shutterfly mobile which should increase the conversion rate the revenue and the average order value and then by integrating thislife where were using algorithmic machine learning to infer about the images we take out more of the human interaction and friction and the timeconsuming aspects of product creation and we move to a thoughtful impulse purchase that could be done on any screen we believe that series of investments will increase conversion rates revenue and lifetime value colin a sebastian  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rohit kulkarni of rbc capital markets your line is open please go ahead rohit r kulkarni  rbc capital markets llc great thank you and best of luck to you brian i would be sorry to see you go i guess in terms of wedding paper divas and tiny prints probably the second time in second quarter youve called out the inprogress technology platform migration can you just draw out what milestones you are tracking as far as integrating the platforms are concerned and how prepared do you think you are as far as q heavy season is concerned and i have a quick followup jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yeah as i indicated in my prepared remarks and a previous question we were going to move the technology platforms at the end of this year into the early part of next year we decided to a delay that by about  months to  months so that we can build a modern technology platform and have everything on a modern technology platform using the shared service model which will allow us to reinvest in feature functionality and product assortment going into  which should have a positive impact on the revenue growth for both wedding paper divas and tiny prints as it relates to key milestones we have a number of them on shutterfly  that were not disclosing externally but it is the largest project that our team is undertaking and we have daily scrums and weekly release meetings so that were constantly keeping on track to our key internal milestones rohit r kulkarni  rbc capital markets llc okay and on the international expansion side any more color commentary you can give jeff in terms of specific investment plans or any buildouts you would need to do or what needs to happen for you to take an international expansion plan a more concrete step towards that jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yes the completion of shutterfly  when we do that the platform will become doublebyteenabled multicurrency multilanguage and then the next step is simply some localization because you dont want to go to england with american english you want to go with the queens english so a little bit of local translation which is relatively quick and inexpensive and then local marketing and so after we get the platform theres not a lot more to be done to be able to go international as we approach that point of view well give the street more visibility as to what our international plans are but as i indicated finishing the platform work on  is another  months to  months that doesnt mean were not going to get benefits from the thislife integration and new releases and mobile updates along the way but to be at a point where we can go international is more like  months rohit r kulkarni  rbc capital markets llc okay thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from the line of heath terry of goldman sachs your line is open please go ahead heath patrick terry  goldman sachs  co great thanks jeff i was hoping you could provide some additional detail on the adoption and engagement for thislife what does the timeline look like for you to begin putting marketing dollars behind it and has the launch of google photos and the evolution of some of the similar services like iphoto impacted your outlook on the prospects for it jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director thanks heath so what were doing with thislife is were merging it into shutterfly and the thislife brand will go away as i indicated in my prepared remarks it will just be shutterfly the allnew shutterfly and so we havent been marketing thislife knowing that that is coming outside of a link on the website which tens and tens of thousands of people sign up each quarter and so were pleased by the engagement what weve seen is those that sign up for thislife their lifetime value is meaningfully higher than those that arent using that service and so i think that bodes well for the future and as we integrate it were not going to give customers a choice its just going to be the new shutterfly and theyre going to get all of that power of facial tagging of curation of creation of stories of pulling in facebook information all of that and so were very excited about that and that should occur in the first half of  as it relates to google photos and others i dont think that has an impact on our timeline part of one of the five key strategic initiatives around  is about bringing the power of our product creation manufacturing customer support and ecommerce monetization to wherever your photos are so i think that actually allows us to partner in a much deeper way with players in the ecosystem that have large amounts of photos obviously facebook instagram snapchat google apple are players who have a lot of photos that arent monetizing through direct ecommerce today and given our scale our brand our quality and our expertise we think if we continue to build the apis and the ability to partner in a deeper way that will be good for shutterfly as well as our potential partners heath patrick terry  goldman sachs  co great thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian fitzgerald of jefferies your line is open please go ahead john streppa  jefferies llc hi yes thanks for taking my questions this is actually john streppa just curious you mentioned that mobile was up  yearoveryear and a couple quarters into  could you talk a little bit more about some of the information youve gotten from these mobile transactions and consumer behavior how has it changed your view on customer stickiness repeat orders increasing order size et cetera jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yeah the mobile customers so some portion of our mobile customers are new to shutterfly inc and theyre exclusively mobile others and the vast majority are more customers that are using us in multichannel so they may start a project on the couch on their ipad they may finish it on their desktop at work on monday morning or they may get an email on mobile which then they – reminds them to login at night right so were seeing multitouch attribution across many of the devices and so mobile is incremental to the overall spend that these customers would be doing on shutterfly the one negative today that were seeing from mobile is a slightly lower average order value and again thats because we dont have the full catalog of products that are available on the dotcom or the desktop available on mobile today the investments were making in the  platform will allow us to have equal offerings across both mobile tablet and desktop across both android ios and kindle so were going to be deviceagnostic platformagnostic the power and the uniqueness of shutterfly will be available wherever your photos reside on whatever device and whatever ecosystem our customers choose john streppa  jefferies llc great thank you jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director my pleasure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris merwin of barclays your line is open please go ahead chris merwin  barclays capital inc all right thank you just a couple first could you talk a bit about what drove the yearonyear gross margin expansion in the enterprise business i think obviously it seems like enterprise is going to be an increasing percentage of the mix going forward and i guess thatll be coming in at a lower margin relative to consumer so i guess in light of that trend how should we be thinking about margin expansion in  and is that sort of implicitly included in your general commentary around margins expanding in  and then just one quick second one you also talked about shutterfly  setting the stage for international expansion and how should we be thinking about any costs associated with that i imagine that building a brand internationally can have some incremental costs associated with it so just was curious how that might affect margins at some point in the future thanks jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director sure so we were pleased by the continued progress in enterprise and its not one thing its actually multiple things so it first starts with the mix of the clients you have and the work that the clients need in that particular quarter certain projects have lower margin than others with the signing of this large multiyear up to  million contract with a fortune  customer part of that work stream involved more complex projects which carried a slightly higher margin because of our unique capability to deliver it so margin will move around but its moving in the right direction which is up the other thing that i want to make sure people understand is if you take a x card and you sell that to a consumer we sell that between  and  kind of rack rate you take that same card and the same ink and the same paper and the same labor and you sell it in enterprise youre selling that for  to  so the gross margin in enterprise will be inherently much lower but youre getting much more volume and as you get volume your overall economics of buying paper and ink gets more efficient not just for the enterprise business but across your entire base you also get benefits in shipping and you get benefits in labor utilization and you get benefits in capacity utilization and throughput on your machines so enterprise is not only benefiting the enterprise division but its benefiting the entire corporate pl so we think enterprise margins will continue to move around quarter to quarter but generally in the direction of going up but they will never approach the level of consumer margins second what ive said consistently is that i believe margins in the back half of  will get better and i think we demonstrated that in q and also with our q guidance and fullyear guidance and that  margins will continue to improve but were just going to continue to invest in shutterfly  in mobile in wedding in enterprise in subsegments like hispanic so that we are growing the ultimate size of the franchise and that the total free cash flow dollars and the total revenue will be bigger in the out years and so its a balanced approach between continue to expand margins but making sure that we have healthy top line growth and continued opportunities for the firm as you look out into international i think its premature to be able to be specific around costs but certainly we would only – theres always a startup cost in any specific country having been at ebay and altavista when we went global and being on groupons board lots of experience around the startup costs theres certainly startup costs but remember currently in the us we are profitable on the very first transaction for every customer because were vertically integrated and because of our brand and our acquisition costs so while theres likely some startup costs i dont anticipate them to be large and we will be thoughtful about how we do that and we will communicate that to the street in  months or so when were prepared to go international chris merwin  barclays capital inc all right thanks jeff and brian best of luck brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kerry rice of needham your line is open please go ahead kerry rice  needham  co llc thanks first brian it was great working with you and good luck on your next venture brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks kerry kerry rice  needham  co llc maybe related to the tiny prints and discussion around the pushout of that replatforming until next year last q there was some production issues around tiny prints i think it was a pretty complex card stock and maybe could you give us an update what youve done to resolve that and kind of the risk that something like that happens in q and then my other question is the strong growth in enterprise in q was that all related to the fortune  customer or were some other things in there that was able to push it to the higher level thanks jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director sure so tiny prints is our premium brand and whats happening in the industry is that those affluent customers are looking for something new every year so a couple years ago it was rounded corners then it was clear cards and then it was foil last year and this year our glitter cards are really popular and resonating so youve got to keep the line fresh and so youre constantly investing in new form factors new finishing new edge treatments all these things that add a little bit of extra complexity each year into your execution last year our big challenge was primarily from the fact that our foil cards saw greater demand than we forecasted and our outsource partner for that technology couldnt handle the overflow of demand that we generated and so that created some delays for customers we brought some of the production inhouse weve expanded our outsource partner network and we believe we have a better handle on forecasting but if youve got something thats really popular and it exceeds your expectations in some ways thats not a bad thing and then on the technology side tiny prints was built as a startup weve scaled it from a database standpoint from a security standpoint from a capability standpoint but its still a technology stack that needs to be modernized and moved on to the larger scaled shutterfly platform and so the tech team has worked since last q to ensure that our uptime and availability is where it is so we cant foresee unforeseen things today but i believe that were very well prepared from a technology and manufacturing standpoint as you think about enterprise it wasnt just this new contract we continue to execute on existing projects for existing clients and taking on more work as we continue to deliver and meet and exceed expectations of those enterprise clients and we landed a number of new clients that are still relatively small but that were investing in and that we believe will continue to grow over the last few years weve actually pruned our enterprise client list significantly essentially firing over  clients because we didnt believe they would hit the profitability thresholds we would need or the size and scale that we would want so as we invest in the platform the enterprise platform that will allow us to go after larger multiyear multimillions of dollar clients instead of hundreds of thousands of dollars of deals and were in the middle of that transition period over the next four quarters to six quarters but benefiting from a few very large clients that are covering our fixed costs as we make that transition brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president and kerry if i could add on this theres scale benefit to the enterprise business that were actually seeing but keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of last year that were now lapping there was some nice growth from around  million to around  million in revenues so the yearoveryear growth hurdle will get a little bit higher and so well begin to get those scale benefits but the growth percentages will certainly be a higher level of hurdle on a yearoveryear basis and keep that in mind in the forecast kerry rice  needham  co llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mitch bartlett of craighallum your line is open please go ahead mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc thank you could you just go back over the promotional activity that youre engaged in at the end of the quarter specifically the flash sales and how aggressive was that activity versus prior third quarter periods and just remind us what flash sales or groupons or things like that do to average order customers and total orders what impact does it have on those numbers jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yes so i think we did slightly more at the end of this q than we did the previous year but not orders of magnitude slightly more its part of our promotional cadence weve been talking about publicly for years now during the third quarter getting people into the fold to reactivate them for a large card order in the fourth quarter typically when we offer a free product be that that through a groupon through an email coming directly from us to our customers or through a partnership like mcdonalds or gymboree or childrens place or the gap that customer is getting for example lets say a free photo book that is a  value to them that costs us midsingle digits to produce theyre paying for shipping they might add some extra pages they might add another product into the basket so in general were about breakeven on a free product offer and now we have a customer into the fold some of those are brandnew customers and some of those are existing customers that go wow look at this i got something free and the mentality is its free so ill add some other things to the basket and so that drove down aov by about  yearoveryear but also aov is going down because we offer from time to time free shipping as well and so people are more thoughtful about hitting the free shipping thresholds than not so nothing meaningfully different than in the years past but utilizing some of these large partnerships that weve been able to secure because of our brand strength into the tail end of q brian m regan  chief financial officer  senior vice president and in a q period where theres no national giftgiving holiday you do have a little bit of a greater impact on aov in the third quarter versus the reengagement and the sales that you get out of that same customer in the fourth quarter mitchell palmer bartlett  craighallum capital group llc perfect thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin kopelman of cowen  co your line is open please go ahead kevin c kopelman  cowen  co llc hi thanks a lot i know you touched on this earlier but just given the big jump in enterprise revenue qoverq can you give us some more color on how you expect enterprise to look in the fourth quarter directionally just so we can better understand the trend thanks jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yes hard to give more specifics kevin because we dont guide forward on enterprise just the percentage of the total revenue will be down in the fourth quarter because of the strength of consumer in the holiday season were very pleased by the trajectory of enterprise i think the street has about  million in revenue in enterprise which is a fiveyearold business thats growing at a very nice doubledigit clip and we think that will continue to expand as we finish the enterprise platform which will take another  months we believe that we will be able to add additional clients we only have three or four salespeople in the whole company generating around  million in revenue this year so we feel good about that what we want to do is build more capabilities so that when we go in either to a competitive bakeoff or into a sales pitch theres clear differentiation in our capabilities our quality our timeliness our account management and our roi for our fortune  customers kevin c kopelman  cowen  co llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of trisha dill of wells fargo your line is open please go ahead trisha dill  wells fargo securities llc good afternoon thanks for taking my questions so just a quick one first on the flash sale promotions at the end of the quarter and the free shipping promos that you just referred to were those planned or were they in response to anything that you saw throughout the quarter on the demand side and then i just have one followup jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yeah trisha they were largely planned because these partnerships take months or quarters to layout because we have to be in concert with our comarketing partners marketing calendars so for the large part they were planned out and as we looked at our strategy last year and what was working getting more customers in at the tail end of q benefited q so we did a little bit more going into this q trisha dill  wells fargo securities llc got it and then i know every quarter we talk about the tradeoff between order and customer growth and aov but im just wondering if theres been any shift in the way you think about balancing those metrics now that weve seen four quarters of flat to down aov on an adjusted basis which i dont think weve seen before and i know youve said recently theres no real change in your customer acquisition costs but just wondering if you could speak to the payback on your ad spend given some of these new customers are seemingly spending less at least initially thanks jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director yes so if you look back before the last four quarters the previous i think six quarters saw a meaningful increase in aov right and so its a balance to try to find where to land that dial aov has also negatively been impacted as i said from mobile but getting more mobile customers which was up  yearoveryear and i think approached  or  of the quarters revenue thats going to continue to be a drag on aov until we get to shutterfly  and we can make a full assortment of cards and stationery photo books and all the gifts available on mobile and so i think wed anticipate seeing continued modest decline in aov with continued increase in customers and the number of orders from those customers until  is complete operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our questionandanswer period id like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks jeffrey t housenbold  president chief executive officer  director well thank you everyone for joining us on our q  earnings call as you can see from our prepared remarks and qa the leverage that weve been talking about in the business is starting to materialize and i believe youll see continued leverage throughout the fourth quarter of  and into  we continue to invest in our leading brand portfolio in terms of technology marketing feature functionality and the robustness of our various technology stacks that i believe will serve us well for years to come youve also seen enterprise continue to deliver on the promise in growing in both its market share and in our profit margins and then as weve been talking about were making efficient return of capital to our shareholders through buybacks and decreasing capital expenditures for the full year leading to up to  increase in our free cash flow per share so we are pleased by both our operating metrics our corporate strategy our capital allocation strategy and we look forward to talking to our investors in early  about an approach that was unanimously agreed upon by our board and our comp committee to get additional shares in our employee incentive plan so that we could continue to attract and retain great talent to execute against the strategy that has been allowing us to be the market leader for the last  years so with that we look forward to our oneonones and seeing you guys out on the road thanks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in todays
