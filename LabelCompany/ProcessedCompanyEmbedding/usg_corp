during the period – through engaging in a combination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade and commerce in the manufacture and sale of gypsum board in july  after the jury was committed to deliberate it became apparent that the jury was heading for a deadlock defense counsel moved for a mistrial but the trial judge denied the request although he indicated that if no verdict were rendered by the end of the week he would then reconsider the mistrial motions the following morning the jury returned guilty verdicts against each of the defendants the court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the convictions and that ruling was subsequently affirmed by the united states supreme court on the grounds that the trial judges instruction to the jury was improper as it emphasized a presumption of wrongful intent rather than concentrating on verifying the defendants state of mind through evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in that regard the sherman act does not create a regime of strict liability a good faith belief rather than an absolute certainty that a price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by a competitor suffices to invoke the defense available under § b of the clayton act the ex parte meeting between the trial judge and the jury foreman was improper and the court of appeals would have been justified in reversing the convictions solely because of the risk that the foreman believed the judge was insisting on a dispositive verdict the trial judges charge concerning participation in the conspiracy although perhaps not completely clear was sufficient but his charge on withdrawal from the conspiracy was erroneous civil in  the us justice department filed suit against usg and six other wallboard manufacturers charging them with price fixing under §§  and  of the sherman act the claim stemmed from us gypsums  crosslicensing agreements for its patented wallboard which set prices at which the wallboard must be sold in  the supreme court forced us gypsum and its six licensees — who produced all of the wallboard sold east of the rocky mountains — to cease setting prices and us gypsum was enjoined from exercising its patentlicensing privilege during – in the united states district court for the northern district of california a series of civil antitrust cases were heard that came to be known as in

period – through engaging in a combination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade and commerce in the manufacture and sale of gypsum board in july  after the jury was committed to deliberate it became apparent that the jury was heading for a deadlock defense counsel moved for a mistrial but the trial judge denied the request although he indicated that if no verdict were rendered by the end of the week he would then reconsider the mistrial motions the following morning the jury returned guilty verdicts against each of the defendants the court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the convictions and that ruling was subsequently affirmed by the united states supreme court on the grounds that the trial judges instruction to the jury was improper as it emphasized a presumption of wrongful intent rather than concentrating on verifying the defendants state of mind through evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in that regard the sherman act does not create a regime of strict liability a good faith belief rather than an absolute certainty that a price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by a competitor suffices to invoke the defense available under § b of the clayton act the ex parte meeting between the trial judge and the jury foreman was improper and the court of appeals would have been justified in reversing the convictions solely because of the risk that the foreman believed the judge was insisting on a dispositive verdict the trial judges charge concerning participation in the conspiracy although perhaps not completely clear was sufficient but his charge on withdrawal from the conspiracy was erroneous civil in  the us justice department filed suit against usg and six other wallboard manufacturers charging them with price fixing under §§  and  of the sherman act the claim stemmed from us gypsums  crosslicensing agreements for its patented wallboard which set prices at which the wallboard must be sold in  the supreme

new firms flooded and fragmented the market placing constant downward pressure on prices on december    gypsum and plaster companies merged to form the united states gypsum company resulting in the creation of the first nationwide gypsum company in the united states the new company combined the operations of  mining and calcining plants producing agricultural and construction plaster in  usg

antitrust casesedit criminal in  six wallboard manufacturers including usg were charged with violating s  of the sherman act during the period – through engaging in a combination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade and commerce in the manufacture and sale of gypsum board in july  after the jury was committed to deliberate it became apparent that the jury was heading for a deadlock defense counsel moved for a mistrial but the trial judge denied the request although he indicated that if no verdict were rendered by the end of the week he would then reconsider the mistrial motions the following morning the jury returned guilty verdicts against each of the defendants the court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the convictions and that ruling was subsequently affirmed by the united states supreme court on the grounds that the trial judges instruction to the jury was improper as it emphasized a presumption of wrongful intent rather than concentrating on verifying the defendants state of mind through evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in that regard the sherman act does not create a regime of strict liability a good faith belief rather than an absolute certainty that a price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by a competitor suffices to invoke the defense available under § b of the clayton act the ex parte meeting between the trial judge and the jury foreman was improper and the court of appeals would have been justified in reversing the convictions solely because of the risk that the foreman believed the judge was insisting on a dispositive verdict the trial judges charge concerning participation in the conspiracy although perhaps not completely clear was sufficient but his charge on withdrawal from the conspiracy was erroneous civil in  the us justice department filed suit against usg and six other wallboard manufacturers charging them with price fixing under §§  and  of the sherman act the claim stemmed from us gypsums  crosslicensing agreements for its patented wallboard which set prices at which the wallboard must be sold in  the supreme court forced us gypsum and its six licensees — who produced all of the wallboard sold east of the rocky mountains — to cease setting prices and us gypsum was enjoined from exercising its patentlicensing privilege during – in the united states district court for the northern district of california a series of civil antitrust cases were heard that came to be known as in re gypsum antitrust cases as a result usg together with national gypsum company and kaiser gypsum company were found to have violated §  of the sherman act for conspiring to establish and maintain prices of gypsum wallboard in december  usg together with national gypsum lafarge

attemptsedit in november  the belzberg brothers of canada attempted a hostile takeover of usg usg immediately instituted a plan to buy back  percent of its common stock in an effort to fend off the

corporation usg once again declared bankruptcy on june   under chapter  to manage the growing asbestos litigation costs usg was the eighth company in an month period that was forced to utilize chapter
