reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing the poker room in currier house at harvard college at  he enrolled in the lakeside school a private preparatory school when he was in the eighth grade the mothers club at the school used proceeds from lakeside schools rummage sale to buy a teletype model  asr terminal and a block of computer time on a general electric ge computer for the schools students gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest he wrote his first computer program on this machine an implementation of tictactoe that allowed users to play games against the computer gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly when he reflected back on that moment he said there was just something neat about the machine after the mothers club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers one of these systems was a pdp belonging to computer center corporation ccc which banned four lakeside students – gates paul allen ric weiland and kent evans – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time at the end of the ban the four students offered to find bugs in cccs software in exchange for computer time rather than use the system via teletype gates went to cccs offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system including programs in fortran lisp and machine language the arrangement with ccc continued until  when the company went out of business the following year information sciences inc hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in cobol providing them computer time and royalties after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities gates wrote the schools computer program to schedule students in classes he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with a disproportionate number of interesting girls he later stated that it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which i could so unambiguously demonstrate success at age  gates formed a venture with allen called trafodata to make traffic counters based on the intel  processor in early  bill gates served as a congressional page in the us house of representatives gates graduated from lakeside school in  and was a national merit scholar he scored  out of  on the scholastic aptitude tests and enrolled at harvard college in the autumn of  he chose a prelaw major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses while at harvard he met fellow student steve ballmer gates left harvard after two years while ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude years later ballmer succeeded gates as ceo of microsoft before resigning from the company in  in his second year gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by harry lewis one of his professors gates solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years its successor is faster by only one percent his solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at harvard and spent a lot of time using the schools computers gates remained in contact with paul allen and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of  the following year saw the release of the mits altair  based on the intel  cpu and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company gates dropped out of harvard at this time he had talked this decision over with his parents who were supportive of him after seeing how much gates wanted to start his own company gates explained his official status with harvard that if things microsoft hadnt worked out i could always go back to school i was officially on a leave of absence microsoft main articles history of microsoft and microsoft basic mits altair  computer with inch  mm floppy disk system after reading the january  issue of popular electronics that demonstrated the altair  gates contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems mits the creators of the new microcomputer to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform in reality gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it they merely wanted to gauge mitss interest mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demo and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then the basic interpreter the demonstration held at mitss offices in albuquerque was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic paul allen was hired into mits and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november  they named their partnership microsoft and had their first office located in albuquerque within a year the hyphen was dropped and on november   the trade name microsoft was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies microsofts altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists but gates discovered that a premarket copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed in february  gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than  of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair hobby market was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce distribute and maintain highquality software this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment microsoft became independent of mits in late  and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue washington on january   during microsofts early years all employees had broad responsibility for the companys business gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well in the first five years gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fitunreliable source ibm partnership ibm approached microsoft in july  in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer the ibm pc big blue first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter when ibms representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system gates referred them to digital research dri makers of the widely used cpm operating system ibms discussions with digital research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system a few weeks later gates proposed using dos qdos an operating system similar to cpm that tim paterson of seattle computer products scp had made for hardware similar to the pc microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent and later the full owner of dos after adapting the operating system for the pc microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a onetime fee of  gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibms system they did and the sales of msdos made microsoft a major player in the industry despite ibms name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer pc magazine asked if gates were the man behind the machine and infoworld quoted an expert as stating its gates computer gates oversaw microsofts company restructuring on june   which reincorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman windows microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november   and in august the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate management style bill gates in january  from microsofts founding in  until  gates had primary responsibility for the companys product strategy he gained a reputation for being distant from others as early as  an industry executive complained in public that gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him  of  times when they met again a month later gates won or tied every game he had studied the game until he solved it that is a competitor gates was an executve who met regularly with microsofts senior managers and program managers in firsthand accounts of these meetings he was described as being verbally combative he also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the companys longterm interests at risk he interrupted presentations with such comments thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard and why dont you just give up your options and join the peace corps the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until hopefully gates was fully convinced when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating he was known to remark sarcastically ill do it over the weekend gates was an active software developer in microsofts early history particularly on the companys programming language products but his basic role in most of the companys history was primarily as a manager and executive gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs model  but as late as  he wrote code that shipped with the companys products he remained interested in technical details in  jerry pournelle wrote that when he watched gates announce microsoft excel something else impressed me bill gates likes the program not because its going to make him a lot of money although im sure it will do that but because its a neat hack on june   gates announced that he would transition out of his daytoday role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy he divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed ray ozzie in charge of daytoday management and craig mundie in charge of longterm product strategy antitrust litigation further information united states microsoft antitrust case and european union microsoft competition case gates giving his

observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying i dont recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle worse many of the technology chiefs denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of email that gates both sent and received gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions as to his demeanor during the deposition he said did i fence with boies  i plead guilty whatever that penalty is should be levied against me rudeness to boies in the first degree despite gates denials the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying

felt the need for creation myths before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that we sought false explanations for them now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing and theres no scientific explanation of how it came about to say that it was generated by random numbers that does seem you know sort of an uncharitable view laughs i think it makes sense to believe in god but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it i dont know one of gates private acquisitions is the codex leicester which is a collection of writings by leonardo da vinci that gates bought for  million at an auction in  gates is also known as an avid

teletype model  asr terminal and a block of computer time on a general electric ge computer for the schools students gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest he wrote his first computer program on this machine an implementation of tictactoe that allowed users to play games against the computer gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly when he reflected back on that moment he said there was just something neat about the machine after the mothers club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers one of these systems was a pdp belonging to computer center corporation ccc which banned four lakeside students – gates paul allen ric weiland and kent evans – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time at the end of the ban the four students offered to find bugs in cccs software in exchange for computer time rather than use the system via teletype gates went to cccs offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system including programs in fortran lisp and machine language the arrangement with ccc continued until  when the company went out of business the following year information sciences inc hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in cobol providing them computer time and royalties after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities gates wrote the schools computer program to schedule students in classes he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with a disproportionate number of interesting girls he later stated that it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which i could so unambiguously demonstrate success at age  gates formed a venture with allen called trafodata to make traffic counters based on the intel  processor in early  bill gates served as a congressional page in the us house of representatives gates graduated from lakeside school in  and was a national merit scholar he scored  out of  on the scholastic aptitude tests

left harvard after two years while ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude years later ballmer succeeded gates as ceo of microsoft before resigning from the company in  in his second year gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by harry lewis one of his professors gates solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years its successor is faster by only one percent his solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at harvard and spent a lot of time using the schools computers gates remained in contact with paul allen and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of  the following year saw the release of the mits altair  based on the intel  cpu and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company gates dropped out of harvard at this time he had talked this decision over with his parents who were supportive of him after seeing how much gates wanted to start his own company gates explained his official status with harvard that if things microsoft hadnt worked out i could always go back to school i was officially on a leave of absence microsoft main articles history of microsoft and microsoft basic mits altair  computer with inch  mm floppy disk system after reading the january  issue of popular electronics that demonstrated the altair  gates contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems mits the creators of the new microcomputer to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform in reality gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it they merely wanted to gauge mitss interest mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demo and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then the basic interpreter the demonstration held at mitss offices in albuquerque was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic paul allen was hired into mits and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november  they named their partnership microsoft and had their first office located in albuquerque within a year the hyphen was dropped and on november   the trade name microsoft was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies microsofts altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists but gates discovered that a premarket copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed in february  gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than  of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair hobby market was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce distribute and maintain highquality software this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment microsoft became independent of mits in late  and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue washington on january   during microsofts early years all employees had broad responsibility for the companys business gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well in the first five years gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fitunreliable source ibm partnership ibm approached microsoft in july  in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer the ibm pc big blue first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter when ibms representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system gates referred them to digital research dri makers of the widely used cpm operating system ibms discussions with digital research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system a few weeks later gates proposed using dos qdos an operating system similar to cpm that tim paterson of seattle computer products scp had made for hardware similar to the pc microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent and later the full owner of dos after adapting the operating system for the pc microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a onetime fee of  gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibms system they did and the sales of msdos made microsoft a major player in the industry despite ibms name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer pc magazine asked if gates were the man behind the machine and infoworld quoted an expert as stating its gates computer gates oversaw microsofts company restructuring on june   which reincorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman windows microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november   and in august the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate management style bill gates in january  from microsofts founding in  until  gates had primary responsibility for the companys product strategy he gained a reputation for being distant from others as early as  an industry executive complained in public that gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him  of  times when they met again a month later gates won or tied every game he had studied the game until he solved it that is a competitor gates was an executve who met regularly with microsofts senior managers and program managers in firsthand accounts of these meetings he was described as being verbally combative he also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the companys longterm interests at risk he interrupted presentations with such comments thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard and why dont you just give up your options and join the peace corps the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until hopefully gates was fully convinced when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating he was known to remark sarcastically ill do it over the weekend gates was an active software developer in microsofts early history particularly on the companys programming language products but his basic role in most of the companys history was primarily as a manager and executive gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs model  but as late as  he wrote code that shipped with the companys products he remained interested in technical details in  jerry pournelle wrote that when he watched gates announce microsoft excel something else impressed me bill gates likes the program not because its going to make him a lot of money although im sure it will do that but because its a neat hack on june   gates announced that he would transition out of his daytoday role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy he divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed ray ozzie in charge of daytoday management and craig mundie in charge of longterm product strategy antitrust litigation further information

microsofts business practices have had gates approval in the  united states v microsoft case gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive he argued with examiner david boies over the contextual meaning of words such as compete concerned and we the judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying i dont recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle worse many of the technology chiefs denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of email that gates both sent and received gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions as to his demeanor during the deposition he said did i fence with boies  i plead guilty whatever that penalty is should be levied against me rudeness to boies in the first degree despite gates denials the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying and blocking competition both in violation of the sherman antitrust act appearance in ads mugshots of gates following his  arrest for a traffic violation in albuquerque new mexico in  gates appeared in a series of ads to promote microsoft the first commercial costarring jerry seinfeld

walking out of the mall seinfeld asks gates if he has melded his mind to other developers after getting a yes he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible again getting a yes

the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in ive been very lucky and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world and thats kind of a religious belief i mean its at least a moral belief in the same interview gates said i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that we sought false explanations for them now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing and theres no scientific explanation of how it came about to say that it was generated by random numbers that does seem you know sort of an uncharitable view laughs i think it

college at  he enrolled in the lakeside school a private preparatory school when he was in the eighth grade the mothers club at the school used proceeds from lakeside schools rummage sale to buy a teletype model  asr terminal and a block of computer time on a general electric ge computer for the schools students gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest he wrote his first computer program on this machine an implementation of tictactoe that allowed users to play games against the computer gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly when he reflected back on that moment he said there was just something neat about the machine after the mothers club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers one of these systems was a pdp belonging to computer center corporation ccc which banned four lakeside students – gates paul allen ric weiland and kent evans – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time at the end of the ban the four students offered to find bugs in cccs software in exchange for computer time rather than use the system via teletype gates went to cccs offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system including programs in fortran lisp and machine language the arrangement with ccc continued until  when the company went out of business the following year information sciences inc hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in cobol providing them computer time and royalties after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities gates wrote the schools computer program to schedule students in classes he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with a disproportionate number of interesting girls he later stated that it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which i could so unambiguously demonstrate success at age  gates formed a venture with allen called trafodata to make traffic counters based on the intel  processor in early  bill gates served as a congressional page in the us house of representatives gates graduated from lakeside school in  and was a national merit scholar he scored  out of  on the scholastic aptitude tests

gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by harry lewis one of his professors gates solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years its successor is faster by only one percent his solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at harvard and spent a lot of time using the schools computers gates remained in contact with paul allen and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of  the following year saw the release of the mits altair  based on the intel  cpu and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company gates dropped out of harvard at this time he had talked this decision over with his parents who were supportive of him after seeing how much gates wanted to start his own company gates explained his official status with harvard that if things microsoft hadnt worked out i could always go back to school i was officially on a leave of absence microsoft main articles history of microsoft and microsoft basic mits altair  computer with inch  mm floppy disk system after reading the january  issue of popular electronics that demonstrated the altair  gates contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems mits the creators of the new microcomputer to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform in reality gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it they merely wanted to gauge mitss interest mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demo and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then the basic interpreter the demonstration held at mitss offices in albuquerque was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic paul allen was hired into mits and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november  they named their partnership microsoft and had their first office located in albuquerque within a year the hyphen was dropped and on november   the trade name microsoft was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies microsofts altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists but gates discovered that a premarket copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed in february  gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than  of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair hobby market was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce distribute and maintain highquality software this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment microsoft became independent of mits in late  and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue washington on january   during microsofts early years all employees had broad responsibility for the companys business gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well in the first five years gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fitunreliable source ibm partnership ibm approached microsoft in july  in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer the ibm pc big blue first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter when ibms representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system gates referred them to digital research dri makers of the widely used cpm operating system ibms discussions with digital research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system a few weeks later gates proposed using dos qdos an operating system similar to cpm that tim paterson of seattle computer products scp had made for hardware similar to the pc microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent and later the full owner of dos after adapting the operating system for the pc microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a onetime fee of  gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibms system they did and the sales of msdos made microsoft a major player in the industry despite ibms name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer pc magazine asked if gates were the man behind the machine and infoworld quoted an expert as stating its gates computer gates oversaw microsofts company restructuring on june   which reincorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman windows microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november   and in august the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate management style bill gates in january  from microsofts founding in  until  gates had primary responsibility for the companys product strategy he gained a reputation for being distant from others as early as  an industry executive complained in public that gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him  of  times when they met again a month later gates won or tied every game he had studied the game until he solved it that is a competitor gates was an executve who met regularly with microsofts senior managers and program managers in firsthand accounts of these meetings he was described as being verbally combative he also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the companys longterm interests at risk he interrupted presentations with such comments thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard and why dont you just give up your options and join the peace corps the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until hopefully gates was fully convinced when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating he was known to remark sarcastically ill do it over the weekend gates was an active software developer in microsofts early history particularly on the companys programming language products but his basic role in most of the companys history was primarily as a manager and executive gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs model  but as late as  he wrote code that shipped with the companys products he remained interested in technical details in  jerry pournelle wrote that when he watched gates announce microsoft excel something else impressed me bill gates likes the program not because its going to make him a lot of money although im sure it will do that but because its a neat hack on june   gates announced that he would transition out of his daytoday role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy he divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed ray ozzie in charge of daytoday management and craig mundie in charge of longterm product strategy antitrust litigation further information

microsofts business practices have had gates approval in the  united states v microsoft case gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive he argued with examiner david boies over the contextual meaning of words such as compete concerned and we the judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying i dont recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle worse many of the technology chiefs denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of email that gates both sent and received gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions as to his demeanor during the deposition he said did i fence with boies  i plead guilty whatever that penalty is should be levied against me rudeness to boies in the first degree despite gates denials the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying and blocking competition both in violation of the sherman antitrust act appearance in ads mugshots of gates following his  arrest for a traffic violation in albuquerque new mexico in  gates appeared in a series of ads to promote microsoft the first commercial costarring jerry seinfeld

walking out of the mall seinfeld asks gates if he has melded his mind to other developers after getting a yes he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible again getting a yes

the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in ive been very lucky and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world and thats kind of a religious belief i mean its at least a moral belief in the same interview gates said i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that we sought false explanations for them now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing and theres no scientific explanation of how it came about to say that it was generated by random numbers that does seem you know sort of an uncharitable view laughs i think it makes sense to believe in god but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it i dont know one of gates private acquisitions is the codex leicester which is a collection of

an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then the basic interpreter the demonstration held at mitss offices in albuquerque was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic paul allen was hired into mits and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november  they named their partnership microsoft and had their first office located in albuquerque within a year the hyphen was dropped and on november   the trade name microsoft was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies microsofts altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists but gates discovered that a premarket copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed in february  gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than  of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair hobby market was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce distribute and maintain highquality software this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment microsoft became independent of mits in late  and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue washington on january   during microsofts early years all employees had broad responsibility for the companys business gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well in the first five years gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fitunreliable source ibm partnership ibm approached microsoft in july  in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer the ibm pc big blue first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter when ibms representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system gates referred them to digital research dri makers of the widely used cpm operating system ibms discussions with digital research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system a few weeks later gates proposed using dos qdos an operating system similar to cpm that tim paterson of seattle computer products scp had made for hardware similar to the pc microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent and later the full owner of dos after adapting the operating system for the pc microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a onetime fee of  gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibms system they did and the sales of msdos made microsoft a major player in the industry despite ibms name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer pc magazine asked if gates were the man behind the machine and infoworld quoted an expert as stating its gates computer gates oversaw microsofts company restructuring on june   which reincorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman windows microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november   and in august the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate management style bill gates in january  from microsofts founding in  until  gates had primary responsibility for the companys product strategy he gained a reputation for being distant from others as early as  an industry executive complained in public that gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him  of  times when they met again a month later gates won or tied every game he had studied the game until he solved it that is a competitor gates was an executve who met regularly with microsofts senior managers and program managers in firsthand accounts of these meetings he was described as being verbally combative he also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the companys longterm interests at risk he interrupted presentations with such comments thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard and why dont you just give up your options and join the peace corps the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until hopefully gates was fully convinced when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating he was known to remark sarcastically ill do it over the weekend gates was an active software developer in microsofts early history particularly on the companys programming language products but his basic role in most of the companys history was primarily as a manager and executive gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs model  but as late as  he wrote code that shipped with the companys products he remained interested in technical details in  jerry pournelle wrote that when he watched gates announce microsoft excel something else impressed me bill gates likes the program not because its going to make him a lot of money although im sure it will do that but because its a neat hack on june   gates announced that he would transition out of his daytoday role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy he divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed ray ozzie in charge of daytoday management and craig mundie in charge of longterm product strategy antitrust litigation further information united states microsoft antitrust case and european union microsoft competition case gates giving his deposition at microsoft on august   many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over microsofts business practices have had gates approval in the  united states v microsoft case gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive he argued with examiner david boies over the contextual meaning of words such as compete concerned and we the judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying i dont recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle worse many of the technology chiefs denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of email that gates both sent and received gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions as to his demeanor during the deposition he said did i fence with boies  i plead guilty whatever that penalty is should be levied against me rudeness to boies in the first degree despite gates denials the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying and blocking competition both in violation of the sherman antitrust act appearance in ads mugshots of gates following his  arrest for a traffic violation in albuquerque new mexico in  gates appeared in a series of ads to promote microsoft the first commercial costarring jerry seinfeld is a second talk between strangers as seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store shoe circus in a mall and notices gates buying shoes inside the salesman is trying to sell mr gates shoes that are a size too big as gates is buying the shoes he holds up his discount card which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in new mexico in  for a traffic violation as they are walking out of the mall seinfeld asks gates if he has melded his mind to other developers after getting a yes he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible again getting a yes some say that this is an homage to seinfelds own show about nothing seinfeld in a second commercial in the series gates and seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people postmicrosoft gates meeting with us secretary of defense james mattis in february  since leaving daytoday operations at microsoft gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other

the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in ive been very lucky and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world and thats kind of a religious belief i mean its at least a moral belief in the same interview gates said i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that we sought false explanations for them now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing and theres no scientific explanation of how it came about to say that it was generated by random numbers that does seem you know sort of an uncharitable view laughs i think it makes sense to believe in god but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it i dont know one of gates private acquisitions is the codex leicester which is a collection of

protestant reformed denomination the family encouraged competition one visitor reported that it didnt matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock  there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing the poker room in currier house at harvard college at  he enrolled in the lakeside school a private preparatory school when he was in the eighth grade the mothers club at the school used proceeds from lakeside schools rummage sale to buy a teletype model  asr terminal and a block of computer time on a general electric ge computer for the schools students gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest he wrote his first computer program on this machine an implementation of tictactoe that allowed users to play games against the computer gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly when he reflected back on that moment he said there was just something neat about the machine after the mothers club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers one of these systems was a pdp belonging to computer center corporation ccc which banned four lakeside students – gates paul allen ric weiland and kent evans – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time at the end of the ban the four students offered to find bugs in cccs software in exchange for computer time rather than use the system via teletype gates went to cccs offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system including programs in fortran lisp and machine language the arrangement with ccc continued until  when the company went out of business the following year information sciences inc hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in cobol providing them computer time and royalties after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities gates wrote the schools computer program to schedule students in classes he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with a disproportionate number of interesting girls he later stated that it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which i could so unambiguously demonstrate success at age  gates formed a venture with allen called trafodata to make traffic counters based on the intel  processor in early  bill gates served as a congressional page in the us house of representatives gates graduated from lakeside school in  and was a national merit scholar he scored  out of  on the scholastic aptitude tests and enrolled at harvard college in the autumn of  he chose a prelaw major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses while at harvard he met fellow student steve ballmer gates left harvard after two years while ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude years later ballmer succeeded gates as ceo of microsoft before resigning from the company in  in his second year gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by harry lewis one of his professors gates solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years its successor is faster by only one percent his solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at harvard and spent a lot of time using the schools computers gates remained in contact with paul allen and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of  the following year saw the release of the mits altair  based on the intel  cpu and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company gates dropped out of harvard at this time he had talked this decision over with his parents who were supportive of him after seeing how much gates wanted to start his own company gates explained his official status with harvard that if things microsoft hadnt worked out i could always go back to school i was officially on a leave of absence microsoft main articles history of microsoft and microsoft basic mits altair  computer with inch  mm floppy disk system after reading the january  issue of popular electronics that demonstrated the altair  gates contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems mits the creators of the new microcomputer to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform in reality gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it they merely wanted to gauge mitss interest mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demo and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then the basic interpreter the demonstration held at mitss offices in albuquerque was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic paul allen was hired into mits and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november  they named their partnership microsoft and had their first office located in albuquerque within a year the hyphen was dropped and on november   the trade name microsoft was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies microsofts altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists but gates discovered that a premarket copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed in february  gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than  of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair hobby market was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce distribute and maintain highquality software this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment microsoft became independent of mits in late  and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue washington on january   during microsofts early years all employees had broad responsibility for the companys business gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well in the first five years gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fitunreliable source ibm partnership ibm approached microsoft in july  in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer the ibm pc big blue first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter when ibms representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system gates referred them to digital research dri makers of the widely used cpm operating system ibms discussions with digital research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system a few weeks later gates proposed using dos qdos an operating system similar to cpm that tim paterson of seattle computer products scp had made for hardware similar to the pc microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent and later the full owner of dos after adapting the operating system for the pc microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a onetime fee of  gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibms system they did and the sales of msdos made microsoft a major player in the industry despite ibms name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer pc magazine asked if gates were the man behind the machine and infoworld quoted an expert as stating its gates computer gates oversaw microsofts company restructuring on june   which reincorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman windows microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november   and in august the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate management style bill gates in january  from microsofts founding in  until  gates had primary responsibility for the companys product strategy he gained a reputation for being distant from others as early as  an industry executive complained in public that gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him  of  times when they met again a month later gates won or tied every game he had studied the game until he solved it that is a competitor gates was an executve who met regularly with microsofts senior managers and program managers in firsthand accounts of these meetings he was described as being verbally combative he also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the companys longterm interests at risk he interrupted presentations with such comments thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard and why dont you just give up your options and join the peace corps the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until hopefully gates was fully convinced when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating he was known to remark sarcastically ill do it over the weekend gates was an active software developer in microsofts early history particularly on the companys programming language products but his basic role in most of the companys history was primarily as a manager and executive gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs model  but as late as  he wrote code that shipped with the companys products he remained interested in technical details in  jerry pournelle wrote that when he watched gates announce microsoft excel something else impressed me bill gates likes the program not because its going to make him a lot of money although im sure it will do that but because its a neat hack on june   gates announced that he would transition out of his daytoday role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy he divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed ray ozzie in charge of daytoday management and craig mundie in charge of longterm product strategy antitrust litigation further information united states microsoft antitrust case and european union microsoft competition case gates giving his deposition at microsoft on august   many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over microsofts business practices have had gates approval in the  united states v microsoft case gates gave

observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying i dont recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle worse many of the technology chiefs denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of email that gates both sent and received gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions as to his demeanor during the deposition he said did i fence with boies  i plead guilty whatever that penalty is should be levied against me rudeness to boies in the first degree despite gates denials the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying

try and reduce the inequity in the world and thats kind of a religious belief i mean its at least a moral belief in the same interview gates said i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that we sought false explanations for them now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing and theres no scientific explanation of how it came about to say that it was generated by random numbers that does seem you know sort of an uncharitable view laughs i think it makes sense to believe in god but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it i dont

corporation there was a magical breakthrough when the computer became cheap and we could see that everyone could afford a computer personal computer revolution date of birth october   microsoft ceo bill gates   doug wilsoncorbiswilliam h gates iii was born in seattle washington the second of three children in between an older and a younger sister his father was a successful attorney and it was expected that young bill would follow in his father’s footsteps he was a notably gifted student who did well in all subjects but showed a special aptitude for mathematics when he was  his parents believed he was not being challenged in his public school and enrolled him in the private and highly demanding lakeside school the school acquired a computer terminal and young bill gates was immediately fascinated he and a small group of friends including his future business partner paul allen took every opportunity to explore the possibilities of the new technology teaching themselves the basics of computer programming soon gates and his friends were working parttime and summers writing computer programs for large businesses around the seattle area although they were all precociously gifted programmers it became clear that gates had a unique talent for business as well and he quickly emerged as the leader of the group gates and paul allen closely followed events in the computer industry and foresaw that the development of microprocessors would lead to the creation of compact affordable personal computer that would someday supplant the bulky mainframe systems used in business and industry the january  issue of popular electronics featured the new altair  and alerted bill gates and paul allen that the era of the personal computer was beginningmeanwhile gates continued to excel in his studies and followed his parents’ wishes by going to harvard paul allen soon moved to boston to work for honeywell and continue their collaboration the pair were galvanized by a cover story in popular electronics promoting the altair  an inexpensive microcomputer produced by a company called mits in albuquerque new mexico gates and allen saw this as the beginning of a new industry no one had yet developed software for the altair and the young programmers saw a unique opportunity they adapted the computer language basic to run on the new device although they had never actually seen one on the strength of this programming feat they secured a software development contract with mits with irresistible business opportunities beckoning gates left harvard at the beginning of his junior year to make the leap into the world of business along with paul allen he moved to new mexico at the end of  to produce software for mits the following year they started their own company microsoft s bill gates and microsoft created software for every personal computer on the market including apple iiafter mits was sold gates moved microsoft to bellevue washington near his hometown of seattle a choice that would make the pacific northwest a center of the computer software industry the altair along with personal computers produced by atari commodore and other industry pioneers enjoyed popularity with hobbyists and computer aficionados but had not achieved a comparable success with business or the general public a vast untapped market the dominant player in the computer industry ibm had long resisted the concept of the personal computer because mainframe systems were the heart of its business when ibm finally decided to make the move into manufacturing personal computers in  it turned to gates and microsoft to produce an operating system william h gates iii ceo of microsoft holds a windows  floppy disk soon after its  release  corbisgates bought an existing program qdos and adapted it to the ibm hardware he named his program microsoft disk operating system or msdos in his agreement with ibm gates was careful to retain the right to license msdos to other hardware manufacturers as well this may have been the single most momentous decision in business history when the ibm pc became a success other manufacturers rushed to create less expensive dosbased personal computers microsoft’s operating system became the universal standard as personal computer use exploded around the world the only noteworthy competitor in personal computer operating systems apple had made the opposite decision the macintosh operating system could only run on apple macintosh computers and apple never gained more than a fraction of the worldwide desktop computer market microsoft’s cofounder and chairman bill gates receives the golden plate award from awards council member dr arno penzias recipient of the nobel prize in physics at the  academy of achievement summit in nevadaapple’s one advantage appeared to be the ease of use of its graphic user interface but microsoft quickly met that challenge with the  introduction of windows a dosbased graphic interface with most of the world’s personal computers running msdos and windows gates had a perfect market for compatible software applications within a few years the applications in microsoft’s office suite had become the leaders in their respective categories microsoft word for word processing excel for creating spreadsheets powerpoint for slideshowstyle graphic presentation and internet explorer for browsing the increasingly popular world wide web may  bill gates of microsoft and steve jobs chairman of apple computer at all things digital  conferencein  gates founded corbis a digital image licensing company that acquired historic collections of photographs such as the bettmann archive among other business interests he has served as a director of the investment company berkshire hathaway and holds a controlling interest in a private investment firm and holding company cascade investments llc bill and melinda gates during their visit to the oslo opera house on june   the gates foundation is the largest private foundation in the world the primary aims of the foundation are to enhance global healthcare and reduce poverty and in america to expand educational opportunities and the access to information technologymeanwhile the personal computer — and microsoft software — revolutionized the worlds of work and recreation microsoft became an enormous international corporation and by  its chairman ceo and largest shareholder bill gates was the world’s richest man a title he has retained almost every year since by  bill gates had amassed a personal fortune of  billion november   bill gates listens to a question as he appears with investor warren buffett for a town hall style meeting with students broadcast by financial television network cnbc at columbia university in new york citythere were challenges along the way — a patent infringement suit from apple over the design of the windows interface and a  antitrust suit brought by the united states government when it appeared that microsoft’s dominant position in the industry had become a virtual monopoly microsoft survived these legal battles and remains the preeminent producer of software for the home and office bill and melinda gates meet with some grant recipients of the gates foundation programs in dakha bangladeshin  bill gates married the former melinda french the couple built a technologically advanced house overlooking lake washington they have three children at the height of his success gates turned his attention from business to philanthropy in  he and his wife founded the bill and melinda gates foundation and have given over  billion to charities focused on scientific research and international development the same year bill gates stepped down as chief executive officer of microsoft though he remains chairman of the board of directors since  he has devoted his energies to the direction of the gates foundation applying his entrepreneurial expertise to combating disease and poverty around the world  through the foundation’s efforts half a billion children have been immunized since  saving the lives of as many as seven million who might otherwise have died of infectious diseases november   president barack obama awards global health philanthropists bill and melinda gates with the presidential medal of freedom during an inspiring ceremony in the east room of the white house in washingtonin  the contributions of bill and melinda gates to business information technology and international philanthropy were recognized with the presidential medal of freedom the nation’s highest civilian honor the presidential awards citation read in part “from helping women and girls lift themselves and their families out of poverty to empowering young minds across america they have transformed countless lives with their generosity and innovation bill and melinda gates continue to inspire us with their impatient optimism that together we can remake the world as it should be” inducted in  career entrepreneur date of birth october   in the last decades of the th century a revolution in information technology transformed commerce and consciousness just as the printing press transformed civilization  years before these advances in computer technology and communications would have remained the province of professional scientists and megabusiness if not for the introduction of the personal computer and no person played a greater role in bringing the computer into homes and offices all over the world than william h gates iii bill gates was a teenage computer whiz when he dropped out of harvard to start his own company microsoft through a brilliant combination of technical prowess and business insight gates made microsoft the indispensable supplier of operating systems and office software to computer users around the world if you use a computer to write a letter compose an email or visit a website chances are you’re using microsoft software microsoft’s uncontested dominance of the personal computer software market made bill gates the richest man in the world he has used his personal wealth to attack the most intractable global problems of disease and poverty through the bill and melinda gates foundation watch full interview personal computer revolution seattle washington march   you dropped out of harvard in your junior year to start microsoft with your friend paul allen what was your original business plan bill gates microsoft was the first software company where we wrote software for personal computers and we believed that we could hire the best engineers there was an unbelievable amount of software to be written and we could do it well and we could do it on a global basis the original customer base was the hardware manufacturers we sold to literally hundreds and hundreds you know over  companies in japan over  companies doing word processors and industrial control type things we knew in the long run we wanted to sell software directly to users but we actually didn’t get around to that until  when we had our first sort of games and productivity software that people would go to a computer store and actually buy the software package when did you first have the vision of a computer on every desk at work and in every home bill gates paul allen and i had used that phrase even before we wrote the basic for microsoft keys to success — vision we actually talked about it in an article in — i think  was the first time it appears in print — where we say “a computer on every desk and in every home…” and actually we said “…running microsoft software” if we were just talking about the vision we’d leave those last three words out if we were talking an internal company discussion we’d put those words in it’s very hard to recall how crazy and wild that was you know “on every desk and in every home” at the time you have people who are very smart saying “why would somebody need a computer” even ken olsen who had run this company digital equipment who made the computer i grew up with and that we admired both him and his company immensely was saying that this seemed kind of a silly idea that people would want to have a computer altair  computer with inch floppy disk system circa  computer history museum november when microsoft was starting out you guys made a deal with apple computer for a flat fee of  or something what did you learn from that experience bill gates microsoft did the software for all the personal computers that came out there was the apple ii that we did a basic for which was called apple soft basic there was a commodore pet that we did a basic for there was a radio shack trs  that we did a basic for even atari who initially had their own minibasic ended up using our basic so our basic was running on every single machine including that apple machine we later did a basic for the macintosh we didn’t mind doing low priced contracts at the time because we always knew that there would be new versions and more software that we would do so it worked out well as part of that apple deal i got to know steve wozniak who is actually the engineer and did software programming and steve jobs who later i would do a lot of work with because he was deeply involved in the macintosh work apple sold a lot of those computers — the apple ii wouldn’t you have made a lot more money at that time if you had royalties bill gates well we had plenty of ways to do new versions and addons and things so no the whole structure of the way we licensed things was that we knew we could write software more efficiently than if they hired the engineers themselves so we always were able to say “hey you would have spent a half a million developing that yourself we’ll license it to you for an inexpensive price” we probably could have had higher prices but we were doing fine in fact that  basic that mark chamberlain and i wrote we licensed to about  different people so our profitability was huge even though it was a great deal for apple per machine they paid almost nothing by the s microsoft was the world’s dominant provider of consumer software and bill gates had become the richest man in the world by  he had amassed a personal fortune of  billion in addition the bill and melinda gates foundation had an endowment of  billion and emerged as a leader in venture philanthropyyou came out very early against illegal copying of software you wrote a piece for computer notes warning that piracy could create serious obstacles for your industry bill gates yeah the mits altair people agreed to pay us a royalty for each copy that was sold so if people paid mits we got a royalty and if they just copied the program — which was at the time on paper tape — we didn’t get paid there was a lot of this going on and the amount of piracy was going to determine whether microsoft could hire more people or not so i wrote — it wasn’t mean — what was called “an open letter to hobbyists” that said “by the way this is copyrighted material and the more we sell the more software we’ll be able to write” and that started a debate that rages to this day it will rage for decades to come should creative people who do music or books or software be able to get a royalty for their stuff or should people pirate it there’s a lot of complicated issues in intellectual property but it started early in the computer industry a lot of people did actually respond to the letter by coming back and paying the license fee which was very low i mean everything was very very cheap when ibm first came to you for an operating system you sent them to another company digital research first why did you do that bill gatesi had been talking about our basic and running that on a computer there’s two ways you could run basic you can run it where the basic is right on the hardware and the only thing you’re running is basic or you can put another layer of software in between called an operating system and it can take over some of the work like managing the printers and things and you can have many programs basic or a spreadsheet or a word processor running on top of that and as we got disks on these computers it made more sense to have that flexibility the early computers don’t have disks they have cassette tapes and paper tapes and things like that but by  ’ we’re starting to get these big expensive — actually initially eightinch — floppy disks then fiveandaquarter inch finally threeandahalf inch now when’s the last time you saw a floppy disk but they were very important we still have a hard disk the disk built into the computer so you needed an operating system when ibm saw that we had written the software for all the personal computers they came to us sought our advice on the design but we said “you should put a disk in” and since they wanted to ship very quickly another company called digital research had done that work for the bit machines and they were starting to do a version for these new bit machines we convinced ibm to do a bit machine using this   processor well digital research really hadn’t finished the work and then ibm was getting frustrated because digital research wouldn’t sign even the nondisclosure agreement and then some of us particularly paul and a key person named kazi konishi who was from japan and worked with us said “no no no we should just do that ourselves” and because of the quick timing we ended up licensing the original code from another company and turned that into msdos so then subsequently msdos competed with this digital research cpm after about two or three years msdos became far far more popular than cpm and then eventually we would take and add graphics capability on top of msdos and then integrate the two together and so today when we talk about windows it actually includes all those msdos things in it that’s the full operating system although mostly you think of the graphics and the windows and stuff there’s a lot of more classic operating system capability that’s built in there microsoft founders bill gates and paul allen in  just after completing msdos for the tandy laptop and signing a contract to write msdos for ibm microsoft company had  employees in an office in bellevue washingtondid you get a royalty from ibm for each computer they sold with msdos bill gates actually no the ibm initial deal is a flat fee deal another flat fee deal it had certain restrictions that prevented ibm from selling to other hardware makers so if people did ibm pc compatible machines we would get the revenue by doing business directly with those people and the deal was very complicated but it was a deal that steve ballmer — who’s a key person with the company by that time — and i thought a lot about it was a fairly junior team from ibm so we tried to make sure that — given our belief that personal computers would be hyperpopular — that microsoft would get a lot of that upside so they felt they got a very good deal which they did but as the industry expanded we — for new versions and for different machines — we got that opportunity even though they did not pay us a royalty when did you realize just how wildly successful this business would be bill gates even in the early days if you set a computer on every desk in every home and you’d say “okay how many homes are there in the world how many desks are there in the world can i make  for every home  for every desk” you could get these big numbers but part of the beauty of the whole thing was we were very focused on the here and now should we hire one more person if our customers didn’t pay us would we have enough cash to meet the payroll we really were very practical about that next thing and so involved in the deep engineering that we didn’t get ahead of ourselves we never thought how big we’d be i remember when one of the early lists of wealthy people came out and one of the intel founders was there the guy that ran wang computers actually was still — wang was still doing well — and we thought “hmm boy if the software business does well the value of microsoft could be similar to that” but it wasn’t a real focus the everyday activity of just doing great software drew us in and some decisions we made — like the quality of the people the way we were very global the vision of how we thought about software — that was very long term but other than those things we just came into work every day and wrote more code and hired more people it wasn’t really until the ibm pc succeeded and perhaps even until windows succeeded that there was a broad awareness that microsoft was very unique as a software company and that these other companies had been oneproduct companies hadn’t hired people couldn’t do a broad set of things didn’t renew their excellence didn’t do research so we thought we were doing something very unique but it was easily not until  or even  that there was this wide recognition that we were the company that had revolutionized software when you were growing up did you have any vision of what you wanted to accomplish bill gates when i was very young i hadn’t been exposed to computers so i was mostly just reading doing math learning about science and i wasn’t sure what my career would be i knew i loved learning about things i was an avid reader but it was when i was  years old that i first got to use a computer actually a very limited machine by today’s standards but that definitely fascinated me when i was first exposed love at first sight bill gates i was intrigued by figuring out what it could do and what it couldn’t do and some friends and i spent lots of time the teachers got intimidated so we were on our own trying to figure it out actually we gave a course on computers to the other students and it became a fascination where we got paid for doing computer work and talked about forming a company but there was kind of a magical breakthrough when the computer became cheap and we could see that everyone could afford a computer that was much later but that’s what got us to really get together and create a company for software tell us more about your childhood what books were important to you as a kid bill gates well i read a lot there were always contests at the library in the summer where if you read ten books you got a little gold star if you read  you got two and there were five or six girls and i that would always read like  books and we’d see who could do the most it was a broad set of things eventually a fair bit of science fiction because that intrigued me some biographies understanding what different leaders had done and how they’d picked what they wanted to do so i’d say science fiction and biographies were the categories that had the most impact weren’t you a tarzan fan bill gates yeah among the science fiction things william rice burroughs wrote a martian series and i read that and then he also had the tarzan books and there’s an unbelievable number of them like  of them i eventually decided to read those as well was catcher in the rye a favorite later on bill gates that’s right i didn’t actually read catcher in the rye until i was  and ever since then i’ve said that’s my favorite book it’s very clever it acknowledges that young people are a little confused but can be smart about things and see things that adults don’t really see so i’ve always loved it we’ve read that a separate peace is another book that was important to you bill gates yes my second favorite book is the book by john knowles called a separate peace and that’s a phenomenal book i’ve been reading it to my son recently there is actually a movie made of it that’s fairly good but i’d say the book is incredibly good what did you like about it bill gates well it’s two young boys growing up one who is sort of intentionally trying to be good at things and the other is just kind of naturally great at sports and has this wonderful energy and they have this great friendship and it happens to be at a time where the older boys are going off to war and they’re trying go figure out what does that mean to them and the author talks about this period of his life as really defining the rest of his life how he sees everything sort of in comparison to this period where he didn’t really know where he fit in he thought of himself as maybe too calculating the end of the book which i won’t spoil is a bit of a tragedy with this friend of his but it really talks a lot about what is our bargain with the world how do we grow up what are we worried about and how do we take that into adulthood what about school in general you were a great reader otherwise what kind of a student were you bill gates well through eighth grade i was sort of enjoying the fact that i could do reasonably well without any effort they had this thing where you’d get an “effort which would be one two or three and then a grade and so the ideal i always wanted was an a where you had the least effort but the greatest grade so my grades weren’t all that great and then in eighth grade i had been at a private school for a couple of years and decided that i better start getting good grades both in terms of having some freedom the way i’d be treated and thinking about college so from ninth grade on i had a reasonably spotless grade record i got quite serious about grades at that point were you always good at math bill gates math was the thing that came most natural to me and you know you’d take these exams some of which were sort of nationwide exams and i did quite well on those that gave me some confidence and i had some teachers who were very encouraging they let me read textbooks they encouraged me to take a college course on symbolic math which is actually called algebra so i felt pretty confident in my math skills which is a nice thing because not only the sciences but economics a lot of things if you’re comfortable with math and statistics and ways of looking at cause and effect that’s extremely helpful do any particular math teachers come to mind from that era bill gates i had one named paul stockland at the school who challenged me later one named fred wright who challenged me i actually majored in math for the time i was at college because it’s a very interesting topic but it was kind of a strange topic because there’s not a direct career for most people in terms of being a full time mathematician so for all but a very few people it’s a tool that you use but probably not what you’re going to spend your life working on your parents took you out of public school to send you to the lakeside school apparently that school had a big impact on you why did they make that move bill gates my parents had this notion that i had this high potential somehow and that i was not taking advantage of it the environment that i had been in sort of being a goofoff was more socially rewarding than being that serious it was public school so they weren’t pushing people all that hard you could read the textbook in the first week and there wasn’t anything interesting going to happen the rest of the school year so they had me take an exam to go to a private school and i thought “well should i pass this exam or not you could fail it and you wouldn’t have to go” but that sort of violated my sense of integrity “hey i’m good at taking tests i don’t want to get confused about that” so i was admitted and they encouraged me to go it was a boys’ school reasonably strict during the time i was there it actually transitioned merged with a girls’ school and stopped having uniforms stopped calling the teachers “master” so it became pretty normal but it was a change at first and the idea of just being kind of a goofoff wasn’t the sort of high reward position like it had been in public schools so my parents were right it had the intended effect of creating a more challenging environment and some teachers who were nice about saying that i should try harder and exposing me to a lot of math and science and eventually that’s where i got to use the computer we’ve read that at first you weren’t thrilled about the transfer to lakeside bill gates lakeside was a longer school day and it’s a change i had gotten super comfortable at public school kind of being goofy and here people were studying and at first because i didn’t get great grades they had me in a study hall and a few people who got really good grades didn’t have to go to the study hall nobody knew that i was actually clever so they were actually treating me like some average student anyway it was an adjustment all the other kids there were making the adjustment as well so it took a couple of years to get my grounding i’m super glad that i went to that school it is a fantastic school i’ll probably send my kids to that school could you tell us about the role of the lakeside school mother’s club in introducing you to computers bill gates the lakeside’s mother’s club had a rummage sale every year to raise money for the school and instead of just funding the budget they always would fund something kind of new and interesting in addition and without too much understanding they decided having a computer terminal at the school would be a novel thing it was a teletype — upper case only ten characters a second — and you had to share a phone line to call into a big timesharing computer that was very expensive when you were connected up it would charge and then when you actually had a program running it would charge a lot more so they set up this teletype and some of the math and science teachers played around with it one of them accidentally spent a lot of money with an infinite loop program they spent like  by surprise so they were a bit intimidated and a bunch of us kind of hung out there and tried out different things the programming language was basic which was quite novel at the time it had been invented by some dartmouth professors so that was the first computer language i learned and i wrote increasingly complex programs so that eighth grade exposure was a pretty neat thing even though the machine we were working on was quite limited even most colleges didn’t have one of those at that time bill gates no the idea of students playing around with a computer was very unusual at the time in fact that computer — eventually the costs were high enough they took it away but then some other computer companies had come around including one in seattle that a bunch of us went down and volunteered to help out and do some work for so from that point on we always managed — although it was dicey at times — to find access to computers that was very unusual in high school but it took a lot of initiative on our part to get those experiences but we wouldn’t have done it if we hadn’t had that early eighth grade exposure for people who don’t remember those early computers could you explain why timesharing was so important bill gates computers were immensely expensive and cost millions of dollars — a machine that was far less powerful than what you have on a cell phone today so either you would have a very important application or you just shared the machine with other people and still you had to pay quite a bit of money so timesharing is where you’re connected up and sharing the machine it’s a lot better than sending your programs in because you can see when you make a mistake pretty quickly even so because they charged us so much we actually typed the programs offline on a paper tape so that we didn’t have any delay for typing then when we got onto the computer we’d feed in that tape so that it was less time online but it gave you a sense of “okay what you got right and wrong…” and you could try and correct things we also — because at that time the dominant form of computing was using punch cards — we actually did that quite a bit we were down at the university of washington and used some of those punch card systems as computers became less expensive — so called minicomputers — then more people had access mostly scientists and business people but also we managed to find machines that weren’t being used at night the idea of a machine as something that an individual would use and that it would just sit there idle when they weren’t using it — that only made sense about a decade later when the work that we and others had done had gotten the price down so dramatically that the idea of a computer sitting idle doesn’t feel like some huge waste of resources like it did when they were so expensive and rare to someone who’s never done any programming can you describe what made it so exciting to you at the beginning bill gates well programming is where you’re describing to the machine how to do something– telling it how to play tictactoe telling it how to play the board game monopoly telling it how to convert numbers from one base to another there are these simple instructions but if you put them together you can synthesize something quite complex it’s a fascinating kind of mathematical thing how can you make it fast how can you make it small i went through several phases of doing more complex programs where people who were great programmers would look at my work give me feedback on it and you get so you can be quite a good programmer it was kind such an intense activity between the age of  and  that we learned a lot eventually one of the programs we took on was the idea of the scheduling of our school when should the classes meet who should be in what section you have all these requests for people who want different classes and keeping them small and not having the teachers teach too many classes in a row — very complex kind of software problem and actually when the school first asked me to do it when i was  i said that i didn’t know how and they asked some adults to do it and that didn’t work then about a year later i’d figured out how to do it and so my friends and i actually did the software that did all this high school scheduling it had some fantastic benefits to us and we got paid for doing it it was exactly the kind of complex problem that developed my skills very well and we got some degree of control over who was in our classes so it combined the best of everything we’ve read that at one point your fellow members of the computer club at lakeside kicked you out is that true bill gates yeah initially when that teletype showed up there were probably  kids who showed an interest it was confusing enough that it got whittled down to about eight or nine fairly quickly who were quite serious about it then there were about four of us who were hyperserious doing it day and night two of them were two years older than i was and one was my same age now in a high school people that are two years ahead of you they don’t socialize with the young kids all that much so the idea that we had this group the four of us was kind of unusual we called it the lakeside programming group one of the companies we had been doing work for went bankrupt the one in seattle and so we went to one in portland oregon was that c cubed bill gates yes computer center corporation — c cubed — which had been in the university district in seattle we’d spent a lot of time there and they were wonderful to us but they weren’t a well run business so they went bankrupt this company down in portland oregon said “hey we’re not just going to give you computer time you have to do something” so we agreed to write this payroll program and a payroll program is surprisingly complicated there’s all these taxes and reports and things at the state level and federal level anyway they said “well if you could write one of those we’d at least give you free computer time” so i negotiated that deal and the two older members — paul allen and rick — said “there’s not enough work to go around so we’re going to take charge of this” and i said “okay i’m not that interested” because i had in mind how i wanted to do the payroll program so they messed around for about three months didn’t get much done and then said “will you join back up” and i said “okay but if so i’m in charge of this” and it’s going to kind of set a precedent for future activities but they said “no no that’s fine” and so we worked we actually finished this payroll program it was a lot of work the friend who was my age kent evans and i ended up doing the lion’s share of the work now tragically right as he and i finished that he was killed in a mountain climbing accident so then there were just three of us left who’d been extremely involved including paul allen who was the one who was reading the magazines even more than i was he was the one who actually saw this computer on a chip — a socalled “microprocessor” — in a very small obscure article he saw that it would be deeply important and brought that to me in  so we were still  — i was  and he was  at the time was it during your work with c cubed that you got into some trouble for hacking into a system bill gates these c cubed people have this computer which is a timesharing computer and they’re letting us come in at night and they had this deal with the company who made the computer digital equipment corporation that they had this acceptance period if they could find problems with it they could delay their rental payments so they thought of us as kind of monkeys that might find some problems and help them delay their rental payments well that was a fair analysis because at first we were just completely goofing around like we’d try to run hundreds of jobs at the same time or have all the jobs try and grab the same resources to see if we could get the system to fail and we did in kind of this brute force approach so they would report that as a problem and delay their rental payment well a few months went by actually about four months by the end of it we had gotten very sophisticated in fact we’d gotten the source code of the operating system out of the garbage can and were reading it and the kind of problems we were finding were far more subtle in fact we would not only find the problem we’d look and we’d suggest how they might fix it anyway digital equipment got so tired of this they said “look you’ve got to pay you’re going to be able to find these kinds of problems forever but we need to get paid” so then there was a question whether they would let us stay there or not and it was pretty tenuous so paul and i we understood the system well enough that we could look at all the passwords of the various accounts so we would use literally any account and then people — when they found out we had done that they got kind of mad about that they weren’t sure how mad they should be about it because we hadn’t really caused any damage but it wasn’t a good thing computer hacking was literally just being invented at the time and so fortunately we got off with a bit of a warning but there actually was a period that because of that they said we weren’t supposed to use the computer it was over a summer and paul actually went up to the university of washington and found ways to use the computer and get connected up he took a while before he told me and then eventually he told me about that and we got back on after you got kicked off the c cubed system was that tough spending the summer without a computer bill gates yeah well no i had many things that were interesting i was really quite serious about math at the time and various science things paul had actually read more science fiction that i had by a lot so he and i would talk about that but i had plenty of things it wasn’t some great tragedy but then we got pulled back in and then that company went bankrupt and then we had the work for this portland company on the payroll program and then we had the scheduling program we were lucky there were always kinds of things that not only gave us an opportunity but exposed us to that next level after the payroll program then there was a computer project to use computers to control all the electricity grid in the dams of the pacific northwest a government agency called bonneville power had done a contract with a company called trw to use computers to do all this control and trw had committed to do all this really highreliability great software work well they found it more difficult than they expected so they were looking for people who understood these kinds of computers which paul allen and i had done a lot of work on these were the same computers that were at computer center corporation and at this portland company information sciences anyway we were kind of famous — but nobody had met us — because we had filed these problem reports and by the end of these problem reports — they were so sophisticated — it was like “who are these guys out in seattle telling us how to fix all this stuff” so when trw was saying “hey we’re desperate find us…” they’re telling digital equipment who makes these things “find us the best programmers” and somebody says “well there’s gates and allen…” and somebody says “nobody’s really met them but yeah they’re really good we ought to be able to track them down” so they find us this one guy and we go for an interview and these two kids show up and — what was i when i was interviewed i was  when they interviewed me so they were like “we can’t hire you” but then they talked to us about software and we clearly know a lot and when you’re young and you know a lot people don’t have any kind of intermediate thing you’re either what you’re supposed to be which is a kid that doesn’t know that much or they think “whoa this guy is the limit” we were pretty good programmers but anyway so we got jobs at this trw and that exposed me to some programmers who were way better than i was who critiqued my work i could look at their work and this one guy was really a phenomenal programmer was that john norton bill gates yeah he would just take my stuff and rip it apart you know in this super constructive way anyway it was a brilliant thing so part of my senior year and the summer before and after the senior year paul and i were down in vancouver washington so it kind of took our understanding to a whole new level and it exposed us to a bunch of people there and paul the whole time — ever since he’d seen that microprocessor article — was saying “you know there’s an opportunity here this is going to be big we ought to think what we’re going to do about this” so we kept talking about that so paul allen showed you the article about the microprocessor first and then wasn’t there a cover story in popular electronics about the altair  bill gates in  there’s this obscure article on the microprocessor that intel has done — what was called the  — that paul said “look this thing’s going to keep getting better and it’s going to be better than these minicomputers” minicomputers were like  to  paul and i had borrowed some of those and messed around with those and paul said “no no they’re going to have something better than the minicomputer that costs like ” so we kept watching those chips get better and we did the scheduling program then my senior year we’re down at trw they’re getting better and in fact in  the  chip comes out and paul shows that to me and i say “okay this is better than most of these minicomputers” and so we think “wow somebody’s going to take that chip and do something wild” in the meantime i start at harvard university back in cambridge massachusetts paul’s at washington state another place so i help him get a job out there in the boston area and we’re just brainstorming you know “what’s going to happen with the microprocessor” i’m playing poker signing up for lots and lots of classes undergraduate classes graduate classes but then… finally somebody takes the  chip and creates a kit computer and that’s on the cover of the january  popular electronics that comes out in december  so we get that and that’s both exciting — because finally this thing that we’ve expected has happened — but the question is “is it happening without us” and so this company which is in albuquerque new mexico we call them up and say “hey we can do software for this machine” and they say “oh yeah sure” so we very quickly work on a basic for this computer which i’m well equipped to do and paul had some brilliant ideas about how we’d simulate this machine because we didn’t have one and that was amazing so we write this thing and we call them up and we say “hey when you connect a teletype up what’s the software programming to get the characters in to print them how do you do that” the socalled “input output” and they thought “well that’s interesting you guys may not be flaky because actually you’re the first one who asked that question” which is if you’re going to really write the software you eventually have to ask that question so they give us the answer and paul flies out with this paper tape of the software you did this while you were still at harvard bill gates right so i’m a student at harvard paul’s working at honeywell but we spend — what was it — six weeks and really write this thing which — you know my whole career has sort of been building after this thing it’s one of the most — probably the most fun piece of software i ever wrote i mean it’s unbelievable because it has to be very small — there’s only k bytes of memory — and we don’t have the real machine so you have to be very careful you get everything right anyway so paul takes it out and these guys mostly sell kit computers they’d only assembled a few of them and so they got it connected up and paul puts it in and it runs the first time but you didn’t even have the machine did you bill gates yeah that’s a complication when you turn a computer on there’s nothing in it it doesn’t even know how to go out to the teletype and read this paper tape that has all these funny numbers on it that are this program so you have to put in — using the switches — a little program that’s the program called the bootstrap loader that is the instructions to say “hey go read a bunch of numbers off of this paper tape put those into the memory and then go run that program” so he wrote a bootstrap loader literally on the plane flying there he wrote a nice bootstrap loader it worked just fine later i wrote a really really small one because it’s a pain to have to — every time the computer is turned back on you have to reenter the thing so the less of these funny little instructions the better anyway so he wrote that and everybody was amazed because we had to do everything totally right how we read this instruction set manual and they were selling these kit computers but they had never really seen it do anything real and so paul would type in ‘print  plus ’ print…” and he ran programs and it worked and this was a machine that you had never actually seen bill gates that’s right the chip itself was fairly expensive paul and i had bought a previous chip to do a very specialized machine we had bought an  to do a little funny program that did traffic volume printouts but this  was much better and we had never had one of those so we just read the book that described how it worked and then we made the big computer that we’d been using all those years — and we’re quite expert in — paul had a really breakthrough idea of how to do the simulation thing so that gave us the full power of that computer to edit and debug and those things but if we had any mistake in how we read this thing that paper tape wasn’t going to work at all anyway so that was very exciting and we signed a deal with them that was called mits and their computer was called the altair and then i left harvard university and we started microsoft so microsoft was initially based down in albuquerque new mexico and this is  when we get going how did the name microsoft come about do you remember bill gates you know we had been talking about that actually back at harvard microcomputer software and nobody else had done a company doing software for these things and we thought it was a cool term “microsoft” when we had been kids and sending our names in for mailing lists we’d played around with a lot of company names including “allen  gates” or things like that but we decided no it would be better not to have our names in it because it wasn’t like a law firm that was always kind of a small thing we thought “hey we’re going to have a big company so we’ll have a company name” so “microsoft” was a very natural choice when ed roberts of mits agreed to buy your program you included a “best efforts” clause requiring him to try to sublicense and promote your software how did that turn out bill gates microsoft was only a few people and we’d written this basic and the idea was to license it to lots of companies and then to write other software so the head of mits said he could help us market it to other people and take a sales commission for that and i wrote the contract so that if they weren’t serious about promoting it and putting a lot of investment into that they would lose that right that was the “best efforts” clause a very strong requirement they never got serious about that and yet they kind of liked the idea of them having the basic and other people not so we were discussing that how we were going to resolve this problem because we needed to license it to other people and we were doing all the work to license it to other people even though they were getting this commission and right at that time another company pertec bought mits and then those people got confused about the contract and so they weren’t even paying us the money they owed us they were essentially trying to starve us so we terminated the contract it had an arbitration clause the arbitrator found that we were right five out of five reasons to terminate the contract we were only right about five of them so that contract was terminated and then we had to — like we ended up having to do — built our sales and marketing activities and by then we started to have some other programs as well so we started to hire more people and things really got going the big thing though was that because pertec moved that company out to california we no longer had a reason to be in albuquerque because you couldn’t recruit people there as easily as you could to other locations so we talked about where to move and eventually in  we move up to seattle when you decided to leave harvard to just concentrate on business what was your parents’ reaction bill gates my parents had been fantastic throughout my whole student career i mean getting me to go to lakeside that my senior year at lakeside where i had wanted to take time off and do this job at trw they’d been very supportive of that letting me live down in vancouver washington i challenged them a little bit when some of my coworkers at trw said i should skip undergraduate and just go to graduate school and they were not enthused about that it looked like i would have an opportunity to do that but i didn’t i just went to harvard and that was another case where they were right that socially being with other undergraduates was good i got to take graduate courses up at mit and i did that to a limited degree so i kind of had the best of both worlds anyway when it came time to go on leave from harvard the policies of the school about — if you’re gone — letting you come back are incredibly generous so if the enterprise had failed then i would have been back so my parents were a little surprised and kind of wondering what it meant but they were pretty supportive and in fact when we got into this legal dispute with pertec my dad gave me good advice he was very supportive on that and so we saw that through and then as the company became successful i hope they felt better about it the only really bad case was if i stayed and the company was kind of mediocreally successful if it failed it would be okay if it was a big success it would be okay and they could see i was very energized and i thought we needed to get in at the very beginning and not waste a year or two which is what i had left of my undergraduate course requirements but if kids wanted to follow in your footsteps today wouldn’t you advise them to stay in college bill gates well college is amazing there are all these smart kids sitting around you can talk about anything there are courses you can go to there’s tests to see if you know what you’re talking about there is nothing better than a great college for your experience i would have stayed until the end if it hadn’t been for the urgency i watch lots of college lectures online now because i enjoy that so much so unless you have something that’s really uniquely amazingly time dependent it’s a great thing to finish the degree do you ever wonder what would have happened if the basic program for mits had not worked bill gates oh i don’t think it would have been a dramatic setback we would have figured out what mistake we’d made and eventually gotten the thing running it turns out even though we were in this big rush there weren’t many other people doing serious work at the time it was another couple of years before other software companies showed up and even then they weren’t that serious about hiring people they didn’t have people who really understood about writing software and how you created a company around writing software they didn’t figure out the global nature of the market so we would have been fine but it was certainly exciting that there was no mistake at all what are you most proud of achieving we know you’re not done achieving yet you’re amazingly involved in global health and philanthropy but if you had to look back now what would you say you’re most proud of bill gates microsoft was at the center of the personal computer revolution and particularly the creation of a software market where you went out to lots of companies and encouraged them to write software for different applications mundane applications wild applications that idea that you would encourage people to be creative and build software and there would be a whole industry around that microsoft believed in that and no one else did and so we got that going and that’s led now to where you have all these great choices and it just keeps getting better and better and it’s because of the volume of machines out there it can be sold very very inexpensively so that whole bootstrap getting the industry going making it personal making there be lots of software that’s what we are the most proud of what does the american dream mean to you do those words have resonance in your own life bill gates i think the american dream is kind of a global dream now that young people can come up with new ideas and create companies that make a contribution not just jobs but whatever their innovations that they bring about capitalism is this unbelievable open system that if you combine it with good infrastructure good education the creativity that we find for people who have had those chances is always going to surprise us it’s always going to come up with new seeds new medicines new software new movies things that make the world a better place could you briefly talk about your vision for the bill and melinda gates foundation early on you gave a great deal to libraries and schools now global health seems to be a larger focus bill gates the foundation got started in the late ’s with my dad — encouraging me — an executive named patty stonesifer who’d left microsoft were helping out i was still very busy our kids were very young but we got going we put computers in libraries in many different countries including the united states we did some scholarship things we were learning about reproductive health and population issues and that kept growing and we met people who knew about vaccines so it was a parttime thing global health was a bit over half the usfocused libraries scholarship education work was over a quarter and it was a final piece that relates to other things to help the poorest other than just health things things like finance and savings and you know it grew and then i saw that i could make a unique contribution there and created a transition plan that was four years in the making so now i’m full time at the foundation and playing a role of being the chairman and traveling a lot so it’s equally challenging it’s very fulfilling it’s taking these resources that i’m lucky enough to have because of the success of microsoft and giving those back to the society in a way that can have the biggest impact in your priorities for the foundation discovery is one of the first that’s interesting because it is kind of a parallel to microsoft so even in the area of medicine and vaccines fighting malaria and so forth you’re still focused on discovery bill gates absolutely we need new vaccines we need cheap vaccines we need vaccines that are easy to deliver even in the poorest places where something like having refrigerators is tough to do and it does connect to my experience at microsoft of finding great scientists making sure they understand the problems that are important getting them focused on those things having milestones even if there are setbacks and making sure that — if the possibility is still there — that they get the proper backing this is something that governments don’t do much of they fund a lot of the great delivery — the foreign aid is very very important — but on the discovery side there’s been a deep underinvestment whether it’s a malaria vaccine tuberculosis vaccine about  different diseases that — if things go well — we’ll have vaccines for most of those within the next decade so the foundation is really taking the lead financing that scientific work and already some have been discovered some are getting out there but there’s a lot more still to be done
