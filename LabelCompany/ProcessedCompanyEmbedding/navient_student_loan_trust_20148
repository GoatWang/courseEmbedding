affirmed the outstanding senior and subordinate notes of navient student loan trust  at aaasf and asf respectively the rating outlook is stable the affirmations are due to the notes passing both fitchs credit and maturity stresses at the commensurate rating level a full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release although the class b note passes fitchs aa cash flow stress scenarios the recommendation is to affirm at asf because the implied ratings from fitchs cash flow model are sensitive to modest increases in defaults despite the observation of recent high defaults in the trust fitch expects defaults to decrease in the coming years as the collateral seasons if the default decline does not materialize ratings may be affected key rating drivers us sovereign risk the trust collateral consists of federal family education loan program ffelp loans  of which are rehabilitated loans guarantees are provided by the transactions eligible guarantors and reinsurance is provided by the us department of education ed for at least  of principal and accrued interest fitchs us sovereign rating is currently aaaoutlook stable collateral performance due to observations of recent high defaults for this trust a proxy was used to account for the actual trust performance fitch assumes a base case default rate of  and a  default rate under the aaasf credit stress scenario the base case default assumption of  implies a constant default rate of  assuming a weighted average life of  years equal to the trailingmonth ttm constant default rate cdr utilized in the maturity

reject rate is assumed to be  in the base case and  in the aaasf case the ttm average levels of deferment forbearance incomebased repayment before adjustment and constant prepayment rate voluntary and involuntary are    and  respectively which are used as the starting point in cash flow modelling subsequent declines or increases are modelled as per criteria the borrower benefit is assumed to be

operational capabilities navient solutions inc navient provides daytoday servicing for the trusts entire portfolio fitch believes navient is an acceptable servicer of ffelp student loans criteria variations under fitchs criteria rating us federal family education loan program student loan abs criteria dated july   fitch does not address the process by which it gives certain credit to shortterm assets in its cash flow analysis and it is therefore considered a criteria variation there is no rating impact from such variation under fitchs criteria rating us federal family education loan program student loan abs criteria dated july   fitch utilizes its default model to derive lifetime default rate assumptions fitch assumed a base case default rate for the credit stresses based on actual trust performance which is higher than the output from its default model and is therefore considered a criteria variation had the default model output been used as the base case the implied rating for the class b note would have been aa as well but would be less sensitive to increases in defaults rating sensitivities since the ffelp student loan abs relies on the us government to reimburse defaults aaasf ffelp abs ratings will likely move in tandem with the aaa us sovereign rating aside from the us sovereign rating defaults basis risk and loan extension risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in ffelp student loan transactions additional defaults basis shock beyond fitchs published stresses lower than expected payment speed and other factors could result in future downgrades likewise a buildup of ce driven by positive excess spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades use of thirdparty due diligence pursuant to sec rule g form abs due
