out of the bit while cooling the bit and brought to the surface by air or watermud circulation commonly used for drilling largediameter blast holes in open pit mines as well oil well and water well drilling for sampling mineral deposits air circulation is preferably used above the water table in rotary drilling samples are chips and pulverized rock produced by the abrasive and chipping action of the drill bit rotary reverse circulation rc drilling – rc drilling is similar to air drilling in that the drill cuttings are returned to surface inside the rods the drilling mechanism can be a tricone bit but now more commonly is a pneumatic reciprocating piston known as a “hammer” driving a tungstensteel drill bit rc drilling utilizes much larger rigs and machinery and depths of up to  meters are routinely achieved ideally produces dryrock chips above the water table  penetration below the water table is difficult because the heavy water is difficult for the air stream to lift and the hole generally “waters out” quickly  then the drilling would have to proceed with a watermud circulation which generally results in an inferior mineral samplesee intro to rc drilling atlas copco pdf

ore processing of in situ leach mining solutions or as a byproduct of phosphoric acid production uranium deposit – a discrete concentration of uranium mineralization that is of possible economic interest uranium deposit types – see below unconformityrelated uranium deposits – unconformity related deposits are related to breaks in the stratigraphic record or “unconformities” these breaks generally occur around the contact between  million year old permeable sedimentary basins which sit above a uraniumenriched carbonrich hard rock basement that has been weathered and usually structurally deformed the deposits can be in the basin at the contact between basin and basement or in the upper part of the basement rocks themselves major fault systems and hydrothermal fluids provide the other key ingredients to create deposits unconformity deposits can have very high grades of uranium  and beyond and in  deposits of this type produced over  the worlds uranium sandstone uranium deposits – sandstone uranium deposits are typically formed in continental clastic basins with complex deformed stratigraphy and structure they are a result of the chemical transport of uranium but the source and time of emplacement is typically not known they can form as tabular or lensshaped bodies rollfronts or channels within the host rock permeability of the sandstone and efficient dissolution and deposition mechanisms all influence the formation of deposits grades for this deposit type are typically  —  u and deposits are usually small to medium sized but numerous within an area sandstone uranium deposits are widely distributed around the world and produced more than   of global production in  niger kazakhstan usa and australia were some of the leading producers of uranium from sandstone deposits iron oxide coppergold iocg uranium deposits – the iocg deposit is a complex type of system that is often mined for copper and gold but can also contain a significant amount of uranium this type of deposit is typified by its main example the world’s largest uranium deposit olympic dam olympic dam contains approximately  billion pounds of u in reserve and produced more than  of the world’s uranium in  the olympic dam deposit formed when hot mineral rich fluids from a deep source penetrated a higher granite host rock to cause brecciation and mineral deposition olympic dam is localized at the intersection of major structures and has an associated magnetic and gravity anomaly mineralization includes copper uranium gold silver light rare earth elements and iron oxides the age of the olympic dam host rocks and deposit are the same and are comparable to the ages of the central mineral belt uranium district pegmatiteintrusive rossingstyle uranium deposits – rio tinto’s rossing pegmatiteintrusive deposit in namibia produces nearly  of the world’s uranium annually rossing is a world class deposit and an important model for uranium exploration globally including labrador’s central mineral belt cmb the rossing deposit is characterized by disseminated uranium mineralization dominantly uraninite in a granitelike rock body in areas that have been subjected to intense metamorphism copper sulphides molybdenite arsenopyrite iron oxides and fluorite are often associated with the ore the deposit and others in its class are considered to possibly represent the deeper geologic equivalents of the higher level olympic damiocg model therefore the two models can both be applied in certain uranium districts such as the cmb uranium endowment – the uranium that is estimated to occur in rock with a grade of at least  percent uo the estimate of the uranium endowment is made before consideration of economic availability and any associated uranium

enrichment process uranium ore – rock containing uranium mineralization in concentrations that can be mined economically typically  to  pounds of uo per ton or  to  percent uo uranium oxide – uranium concentrate or yellowcake abbreviated as uo uranium property – a specific tract of land with known uranium reserves that could be developed for mining uranium reserves – estimated quantities of uranium in known mineral deposits of such size grade and configuration that the uranium could be recovered at or below a specified production cost with currently proven mining and processing technology and under current law and regulations reserves are based on direct radiometric and chemical measurements of drill hole and other types of sampling of the deposits mineral grades and thickness spatial relationships depths below the surface mining and reclamation methods distances to milling facilities and amenability of ores to processing are considered in the evaluation the amounts of uranium in ore that could be exploited within the chosen forwardcost levels are estimated utilizing available sampling engineering geologic and economic data in accordance with conventional engineering practices uranium resources categories – three categories of uranium resources are used to reflect differing levels of confidence in the resources reported reasonably assured resources rar estimated additional resources ear and speculative resources sr are described below reasonably assured resources rar the uranium that occurs in known mineral deposits of such size grade and configuration that it could be recovered within the given production cost ranges with currently proven mining and processing technology estimates of tonnage and grade are based on specific sample data and measurements of the deposits and on knowledge of deposit characteristics rar correspond to doe’s uranium reserves category estimated additional resources ear the uranium in addition to rar that is expected to occur mostly on the basis of direct geological evidence in extensions of wellexplored deposits little explored deposits and undiscovered deposits believed to exist along welldefined geological trends with known deposits such that the uranium can subsequently be recovered within the given cost ranges estimates of tonnage and grade are based on available sampling data and on knowledge of the deposit characteristics as determined in the bestknown parts of the deposit or in similar deposits ear correspond to doe’s probable potential resources category speculative resources sr uranium in addition to ear that is thought to exist mostly on the basis of indirect evidence and geological extrapolations in deposits discoverable with existing exploration techniques the locations of deposits in this category can generally be specified only as being somewhere within given regions or geological trends the estimates in this category are less reliable than estimates of rar and ear the category of sr corresponds to doe’s possible potential resources plus speculative potential resources categories combined usage agreement – contracts held by enrichment customers that

corolla hoag and geologist dr jan rasmussen have visited the tombstone property their information combined with the previously gathered geochemical geophysical and computer modeling data  underwent a thorough technical analysis the resulting technical reports concluded that all three claim blocks were worthy of further exploration work in  extensive geochemical sampling at hay mountain rendered approximately  soilrockvegetation samples which were analyzed for  elements at a certified facility in vancouver british columbia  expected  markers for porphyry copper gold moly silver and zinc were present the geochemical data also yielded the unexpected presence of  four of seventeen rare earth elements rees further analysis of the ree data will be undertaken at a later date liberty star

previously unrecognized porphyry copper center two mining companies had some interest in the area during the late s but relinquished the ground despite revealing enriched copper in one hole and substantial amounts of leached capping in all other holes an indicator for porphyry copper deposits stagnant copper prices contributed to the abandonment of the ground prior to the identification of

molybdenum moly silver and zinc status exploration       about the company   liberty star uranium  metals corp is a mineral exploration company led by james a briscoe a licensed experienced professional geologist the big chunk super project consists of  state of alaska acre mining claims covering approximately  square miles of southwest alaska the big chunk claims were initially staked in  after mr briscoe recognized that a caldera which was probably responsible for hosting northern dynasty minerals’ pebble discovery was strikingly similar to the caldera hosting the silver bell mining district in southern arizona where he had worked as a geologist in the ’s and again in the ’s as  august   liberty star has commenced exploratory drilling on the bcsp south block   the phase  drilling plan retrieved core from  depths extending to  feet welllocated liberty star’s ground is located near yearround icefree tidewater on the pacific ocean at cook inlet known mineralization in this area occurs near surface in an area of gentle topography and low elevations the pebble project a joint venture between northern dynasty minerals and mining industry giant anglogold seeks to construct and operate an open pit and underground mine in an area considered one of the richest for porphyry gold copper and molybdenum in the world further development of a port on the cook inlet nearby roads and suitable energy sources are already in process with the approval of the state of alaska and the federal government exploration summary in may  liberty star announced that its geophysical contractor geotech ltd had confirmed multiple porphyry copper ztem geophysical signatures in big chunk’s south claimblock  in august  liberty star began drilling in the bcsp south block  ztem surveys in june  liberty star contracted geotech ltd a canadian based full service contractor specializing in airborne geophysical surveys to participate in performing assessment work required by the alaska bureau of mineral resources for the assessment year  on the big chunk super project at the request of mr briscoe geotech ltd executed a full ztem program over the south block of the big chunk claims ztem z axis tipper electromagnetic system is a helicopter borne survey method measuring electromagnetic activity geotech’s technology and sensitive measuring equipment enables detection and modeling of the shape of metallic mineral bodies at more than two kilometers  feet below the surface conducted in august  the survey consisted of  line km  line miles of ztem and very detailed airborne magnetics the survey lines were spaced  meters  feet apart in april  liberty star received initial word from geotech that the d models resulting from the ztem surveys confirmed mr briscoe’s projections for multiple porphyry centers and associated carlin style and round mountain style standalone gold deposits to be discovered within the big chunk caldera by may  geotech had presented the results of computer processing derived from the ztem data the results were a d inversion which allows for a three dimensional approximation of the porphyry systems present in the south block of the big chunk super project with the ztem data in hand mr briscoe liberty star’s chief geologist collaborated with other experienced geology specialists to analyze all existing geologic geochemical and geophysical data sets compiled from the  exploration work commented mr briscoe “over the last six years we have carefully gathered across the entire big chunk caldera some  thousand geochem samples and assayed them for  elements each completed low level high resolution aeromagnetics and compiled base geology additionally we have completed over  miles of ground based ip geophysics all of this data is in digital format and can be compared and interpreted together at the same scale the new ztem data for the big chunk super projectsouth block will be another step in our meticulous exploration process along with all the preceding studies it will be used to refine and pinpoint what these mutually reinforcing data appear to show – anomalies that are characteristic of large porphyry copper mineral bodies which may contain significant mineralization accurately placed drill holes to test these mutually reinforcing data will be the final step in testing for the presence of significant mineralization” in may  liberty star received word from geotech ltd that their interpretation showed at least  to  signatures that are consistent with porphyry copper responses stated in their report “comparison against ztem d resistivity inversion results have defined resistivity features that resemble typical potassicaltered core and pyriticpropylitic halos over known porphyry systems extending to great depth   km or about  feet” these anomalies are in the size range of the footprint of the nearby pebble deposits also within the big chunk caldera and go to significant depth also stated in the report “porphyry coppers… tend to be associated with pronounced resistivity highs associated with a potassium rich altered core surrounded by resistivity lows associated with pyrite propylitic alteration halos ie mt milligan san juanlone star morrison etc” geotech’s conclusions are consistent with the porphyry copper model which company director dr john guilbert codeveloped and is described and illustrated in his book geology of ore deposits  in june  geotech delivered enhance imagery of the ztem surveyed area that added a more detailed understanding of the terrain  –  exploration

in august and september  approximately  miles of dipoledipole was completed and  rip stations were measured over an area of  square miles a few small areas of ip response were detected with the rip survey ip response was measured on all four ip lines at white sox these results indicate the presence of disseminated metallic material with consistent readings above  msec or mrad drilling four drill holes totaling  feet were completed in the white sox area visible copper mineralization was noted in two holes and visible molybdenite was noted in several places in one hole low grade gold was also encountered with the other mineral intercepts this mineralization and the associated alteration may be indicative of a copper porphyry system  exploration program the big chunk property is in various stages of exploration the white sox area has received the most work and is a little more advanced than other portions of the property a mineralized center has been identified with drilling and geophysics there additional drilling on and near the ip response is planned four months of planned ip should fully delineate the ip response at white sox with additional ip planned to the north east and south of the  survey the company proposes to continue to drill to evaluate those areas where the appropriate ip response is  mrad if oregrade mineralization is encountered the company hopes to initiate a grid drilling program to delineate resources if and as time in the season allowsthe company proposes to conduct dipoledipole and reconnaissance ip on the remainder of the property any higher quality geochemical anomalies will be evaluated with dipoledipole ip if time in the season permits the company intends to drill test dipoledipole ip responses over  mrad if any are detectedthe

company had responsibility for uranium exploration over the entire state of new mexico based on this experience he started a thorough research program in late  to determine the prospects of exploration on the colorado plateau using a multifaceted approach liberty star geologists along with the help of a very talented geologic expert particularly familiar with these breccia pipes identified the breccia pipe targets that we have staked starting in the fall of  according to the us geological survey the breccia pipes in this region are of high grade compared to sediment hosted roll front deposits mined throughout the western us with an estimated potential average grade for ore bearing pipes at about  to  uranium this suggests that such pipes may contain mineral bodies of about  to  pounds or more of uranium per ton at current prices this is approximately equal to  ounce of gold per ton the pipes contain numerous metals in addition to uranium including copper silver vanadium molybdenum cobalt and nickel the uranium mineralization however is by far the most economically important mines in this region have produced some  million pounds of uranium some of these known ore bodies have contained as much as  uranium  pounds per ton in some samples exploration at north pipes is for highgrade uranium ore bodies that can be mined economically by underground methods

company’s premier property the hay mountain project is located in cochise county southeast arizona it is an important part of the  square mile tombstone super project and area of mutual interest the hay mountain project is a multitarget multimetal variable depth exploration project for porphyry copper gold moly and multiple potential by product metals including lead zinc manganese silver uranium thorium and rare earth elements surface studies including “boots on the ground” botg geologic mapping and interpretation geochemistry rock soil  vegetation geophysics of two advanced types airborn digital magnetics ztem electromagnetics and xray fluorescence analysis using the currently most advanced equipment the interpretation of all this information and comparison with numerous existing adjacent ore bodies and other ore bodies known on a worldwide basis indicate the potential for discovery of a high grade and very large limestone replacement and porphyry hosted copper gold and moly ore body it is of the same type as the nearby bisbee deposit and other commercially important ore bodies throughout southeast arizona and elsewhere liberty star plans to engage in exploratory diamond core drilling as soon as possible visit the liberty star website httpwwwlibertystaruraniumcom the rising price of gold is making news again in a big way tell us a little about gold mining in your part of the state southeast arizona jim our hay mountain project is situated in a larger zone of copper and gold mining extending from northcentral arizona east into southwest new mexico and south into northern mexico the us geological survey has recently characterized the area as the “great cluster” of copper resources however the geology of the great cluster includes gold among other metals we have always characterized hay mountain and the tombstone super project as exploration properties primarily for copper gold silver and moly thus we have renamed the usgs area the great cluster of copper and gold resources the historic bisbee mining district  miles south of hay mountain had a healthy gold combined with copper mining enterprise last century the copper queen mine produced nearly  million ounces of gold  oz morenci the pima mine and sierrita mine all report byproduct gold from their copper operations the johnson camp mine to the north as well is a gold producer in fact the johnson camp started life as a silver and gold operation in the late ’s to the north east of tucson in the silver bell mountains where i started working under kenyon e richard and james harold courtright gold was not a major player but has been the subject of continuing exploration to the south of bisbee in sonora mexico we are about  miles north of the mexican border at hay mountain gold mining is very healthy in fact sonora mexico is the largest gold producing state in mexico in  the mexico geological service reported three new important gold deposits in the north west of that state that are being worked on now therefore discovery of gold at hay mountain would be part of a continuum in the area you show several maps on your website libertystaruraniumcom with the hay mountain gold anomaly your geochemical maps are from  and the ztem maps are newer tell us how the gold anomaly was discovered jim  geochem  roger newell phd dissertation stanfordonly copper moly zinc lead and silver  geochem  shea clark smith metals exploration geochemistry his consulting firm – analysis for more than  metallic elements including gold  recent geochem  rock chip soil and vegetation –liberty star under clark smith direction  ztem  with ongoing mapping simply verifies the center of the ztem em and mag anomalies which correspond to the goldmolycopper anomaly thus defining the porphyry copper system  recent niton work fall identifies copper oxide coming from chalcopyrite sulfide mineralization within one to two inches of the surface within and near the central zone of the porphyry system as defined by the above work totaling a twomile stretch where there is outcrop and approximately  analyses for  elements the methodology cannot penetrate through soil or alluvial cover i thus conclude that in fact the defined mineral body is coming to the surface in this area a we conclude this may be a more shallow occurrence than we had previously concluded but one that appears to go perhaps to  feet to the top of old precambrian crystalline metamorphic rocks the deep anomalies are derived from data gathered by the ztem magnetic and electromagnetic helicopter borne surveys b near surface gold andor copper oxide deposits may be present below thin alluvium and may be minable and leached by solvent extraction resulting in early production while developing the potentially giant porphyry at greater depth we are permitting a small trench approximately  feet deep by  feet long in the area of the indicated gold center as an initial test of this possibility of reaching bedrock and of course our phase  drilling will test this possibility what the geoscientific work tells us we are dealing with a porphyry system like numerous others in the usgs “great cluster” but very much larger than most or all driving this porphyry system is a large intrusive known as a pluton or batholith of granitic composition this mass was once molten but now a solidified mass we identified this particular pluton by the obvious signature indicated during airborne magnetometer surveys about  years ago and recent ztem analysis which includes digital threedimensional magnetometry this one is approximately  square miles we have slides showing the ztem data on our website we know it is in the copper age range of this area of about  million years old the geochemical anomaly is centered on the pluton again typical of copper porphyry deposits in the area and throughout the world now you need to find if this anomaly is something more in terms of making a discovery and finding out if it is viable will you be able to do that during phase  drillingjim yes we have designed the test to do so phase  of the drilling plan totaling approximately  thousand feet at hay mountain is structured in such a way that we will be able to make some accurate measurements about the presence of copper gold and moly and other metals assaying for  elements at various depths and locations we are ready to commence phase  in terms of having targets picked out and having our paperwork in order the map shows the proposed drill holes as stars on the anomaly map and a map of the geophysical profiles cross sections with the projected holes superimposed on them along with the geochemistry after completion of the drilling we will know the direction to take the program we should see a near surface presence that will increase with the intersection of more favorable host sediments we know are below as are known in great detail at bisbee and other porphyry copper deposits in the “great cluster” the test holes are permitted to a depth of  feet but greater depth may be required or conversely we may drill more shallow holes in selected areas or a combination of depths we anticipate beginning to define both a large open pit ore body and possibly one or more deep underground minable ore bodies ztem mapping has been very promising in terms of seeing indicators of a deepseated mineral presence we conclude gold will be a part of the picture as it has so frequently been throughout the “great cluster” area let’s talk about grades you indicate you are thinking you will see sufficiently high grades for a near surface program for copper and byproduct gold moly and maybe other metals how did you come to that conclusion other projects in the region specifically the nearby bisbee district reported copper values of from  to  copper replacement bodies in limestone when it was first opened as reported by dr f l ransome in  in his usgs professional paper on the bisbee mining district  xrf x –ray fluorescence analysis of the gossan copper veinlets at hay mountain are in this range and look like outcrops at the entrance to the copper queen copper prince mines at bisbee similar grades in altered and replaced limestones are common throughout arizona liberty star has other arizona projects and you have mentioned uranium and gold properties elsewhere in the southwest on the liberty star website can we have a quick summary the east silver bell porphyry copper project esb is located in pima county northwest of tucson arizona within the silver bell mining district asarco mining operates three openpit mines and a solvent extraction plant sxew about  ½ miles west of the esb property the company maintains claims covering a previously unrecognized porphyry copper center which has been identified by drilling and shows chalcocite enrichment mineralization like that of the oxide el tiro and north silver bell mines operated by asarco  the claims currently are within the ironwood forest national monument established after the claims were staked and have been maintained each year we are in ongoing lowlevel conversations regarding this mineral body  the explorationstage north pipes super project is located in mohave county northwest arizona near the utah border on the arizona strip the arizona geological survey concurs with our extensive work and notes the arizona strip is rich in uranium bearing breccia pipes while uranium is the most commercially important metal the pipes contain numerous other metals including copper silver vanadium molybdenum cobalt and nickel exploration at north pipes is for highgrade uranium ore bodies that can be mined economically by underground methods this may be one of the largest and highestgrade uranium resources in the world after a moratorium in mining by the obama administration eleven claims have been retained over what geophysically appears to be a very large pipe or perhaps a triple breccia pipe  while hay mountain is our dominant pursuit now we have two addition property blocks within the tombstone super project the walnut creek and tombstone south projects occupy other geologic structures suggesting porphyry copper and precious metal targets further study and potential drilling programs are recommended for both in professional technical reports issued in   there are as many as seven properties for highgrade gold and silver in nevada and arizona that we are looking at and others in california that we know about these were producing mines that are dormant and have been since the ww ii era gold closing act these mines closed even as they were producing and still could yield billions in gold and silver especially given the advances in mining technology these may be relatively quick to production projects  the arizona strip and the larger colorado plateau host highgrade uranium deposits our north pipes are in northwest arizona and across the border in southwest utah are numerous shallow uranium targets we are working with a venture partner possibly to develop a low cost quick turnaround program utah is a mining friendly state where this type of program could work  lithium – currently the “flavor of the day” metal exploration primarily due to elon musk’s tesla motors and recently combined solarcity which uses a newly designed lithiumion battery this appears to be groundbreaking technology and a giant plant is under construction north of reno nevada with phase  of  reportedly at completion and battery manufacture underway we hope this progress continues and is ultimately successful as it will be game changing for the usa and the world now the whole lithium mine production paradigm seems to be hanging on this success there are several other battery designs using other metals such as vanadium and others we have target areas for brine based lithium occurrence but we want to bide our time on this rush when we talk about the tesla cars other vehicles competitive brands and solar electric generation one thing is certain they will all use amazing amounts of copper particularly the high performance cars as tesla’s models to move high horse power electricity from the batteries to the powerful electric motors that drive the wheels that drive the vehicles we will be very happy to supply the copper and ancillary metals that will be necessary to drive these high performance vehicles as these vehicles replace gasoline and diesel engines we can be sure the price of copper will move upward to supply the vast needs of this previously unpredicted new type of vehicle and new use of copper thank you that sounds very promising httpwwwlibertystaruraniumcomcorporate headquarters liberty star uranium  metals corp  e sutler lane tucson az  telephone
