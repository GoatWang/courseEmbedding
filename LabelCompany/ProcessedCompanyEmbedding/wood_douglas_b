their first choice repeatedly is douglas fir it is dimensionally stable and universally recognized for its superior strengthtoweight ratio its high specific gravity provides excellent nail and plateholding ability the species also enjoys a documented superior performance against strong forces resulting from natural phenomena such as winds storms and earthquakes it is truly the ideal structural and general purpose wood for framing lumber in residential light commercial multi story and industrial construction the douglas firwestern larch species combination has the highest modulus of elasticity e or moe of the north american softwood species this is the ratio of the amount a piece of lumber will deflect in proportion to an applied load it is a reflection of the species’ high degree of stiffness an important consideration in the design of floors and other systems in strength properties douglas firwestern larch has the highest ratings of any western softwood for extreme fiber stress in bending fb for tension paralleltograin ft for horizontal sheer fv for compression perpendiculartograin fc and for compression paralleltograin fc these physical working properties as well as to the moderate durability of its heartwood and its excellent dimensional stability provide the reasons many builders use douglas fir as the standard against which all other framing lumber is judged it is also tight knotted and closegrained adding the bonus of beauty to its structural capabilitiesphoto above left weathered fir beam and channel siding read more below douglas fir products

strong douglas fir tree is one of the most dominant species in the northwest forests after a forest fire the tree springs to life growing thickly in the sunshine of a newly open area over the past  years it has been the favorite species of silviculturists because of its fast growth and multitude of uses its stiffness and durability make it ideal for structural applications it also makes a good flooring and paneling product as well as a fine trim for doors and windows douglas fir is known for its distinctive grain patterns produced by the varying degrees of spring and summer wood in the grain the color differences between the two range from yellowish to reddish brown douglas fir flooring ages to a warm orangebrown color douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii is not a true fir at all it is a distinct species named after archibald menzies a scottish physician and naturalist who first discovered the tree on vancouver island in 9 and david douglas the scottish botanist who later identified the tree in the pacific northwest in  douglas fir is north americas most plentiful softwood species accounting for one fifth of the continents total softwood reserves the wood of douglasfir varies widely in weight and strength when lumber of high strength is needed for structural uses selection can be improved by applying the density rule this rule uses percentage of latewood and rate of growth as they affect density for equivalent knot sizes the higher density generally indicates stronger wood sapwood of douglasfir is narrow in oldgrowth trees but may be as much as  inches  cm wide in secondgrowth trees of commercial size fairly young trees of moderate to rapid growth have reddish heartwood and are called redfir very narrowringed wood of old trees may be yellowish brown and is known on the market as yellowfir the range of douglasfir extends from the rocky mountains to the pacific coast and from mexico to central british columbia the douglasfir production comes from the coast states of oregon washington and california and from the rocky mountain states douglasfir reaches heights of  feet  m with a diameter of  feet  m in coastal stands that are between  and  years

radio implementation  wood  douglas has proved its capability to combine creative wireless solutions with flawless rf execution mm machine to machine mm communications is one of the fastest growing technology markets in the world a diverse range of industries are adopting this networkbased technology according to research by markets to markets the global mm market is expected to grow  from  to  and be worth 9 billion mm technology allows the transmission of data from one machine to another over a network mm is used primarily for remote monitoring automation and notification it is particularly helpful to monitor facilities that are geographically remote or difficult to access since the deployment of the mobile phone networks and the growth of other wireless technologies there has been considerable interest in mm technology however the technology is not new connected sensors and devices have existed for many years and been an integral part of monitoring and measurement in a number of diverse industries nor is it true to say that mm is only possible since the development of cellular networks any network can be used for mm however wireless networks are usually more suitable to the needs of the mm market wood  douglas has deployed its wireless radio technology in a wide range of application to deliver a robust reliable and fast network for mm services to operate seamlessly we have successfully installed our radio units across diverse industries from utilities and emergency services to homeland security and exploration services working with some of the leading names in these respective sectors qa what is machine to machine mm in simple terms mm is the realtime transmission of data between machines over a wired or wireless network without interaction from a human generally the captured data is then remotely collected assessed and analysed what communications technology is used to create the network any wired or wireless technology can be used as a channel for mm communications typically wireless technologies are often used because mm tends to be implemented to monitor remote or difficult to reach areas cellular satellite and radio frequency technologies are all suitable for mm communications what industries is mm used in mm technology is implemented in a diverse range of industries ranging from utilities homeland security emergency services health care transport exploration services plant and construction oil and gas digital media exploration and mining to broadcast and retail what applications is mm technology used for wood  douglas has deployed wireless technology into a wide range of mm applications for industry for example we have strong relationships with the major utility companies in the uk helping them monitor waste water processes detect leaks in underground water pipes monitor reservoir levels employ smart metering and manage faults on the national grid we also work with major plants across the country in health and safety and delivering tidal information to determine the safe passage of cargo boats into estuary areas what data can be carried on an mm network typically mm communications tend to be used for monitoring or measurement a good example would be monitoring the volume of water in a reservoir a water authority might measure the volume of water in a number of reservoirs over a wide area this information would then be sent to a central control unit that could ensure that customer receive an uninterrupted water supply and ensure that if one reservoir is below a certain level another supplies the water this is just one application of mm it could monitor and measure anything from the speed of water flow to the volume of gas in an underground storage facility and from traffic congestion in a city to environmental measurements in the atmosphere which technology is most suited to my mm project this will depend entirely on the project mm communications can be achieved on cellular networks local rf satellite or even using short distance technologies such as bluetooth each communications technology has its own challenges and opportunities and costs in order to understand which communications technology is right for your mm project it is important to understand exactly what needs to be achieved why adopt mm technology mm technology makes it easier to monitor manage and action critical data mm technology has three key benefits speed information can be transmitted and actioned quickly convenience because mm is automated there is no need for human intervention meaning that remote areas can be monitored without having to send people to physically measure cost mm is highly cost effective what next to understand how mm technology can help you
