with a product line boasting impact resistance pgti has gained traction in the southeastern united states in that area hurricanes have been more prevalent and fiercer the past few years consensus has linked global warming with the increase in strength of hurricanes projecting future storms with fiercer results this is where pgt inc has come to the rescue the differentiation of a highquality product offering protection through the worst of storms has allowed pgt inc to gain market share and the outlook for the future looks solid strategic acquisitions in  pgt acquired a competitor in the same market cgi windows and doors inc the acquisition allowed pgt to focus on sales and not on competing on price in the market along with the ability to allow organic growth in the florida market the acquisition provided pgt with a similar product building revenue growth while resulting in reduced costs through economies of scale fiscal year  saw a  growth in revenue for pgt resulting from a
