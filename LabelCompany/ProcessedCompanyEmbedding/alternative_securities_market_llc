able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not

realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly prior to this offering there has been no public market for caprocq core reit incs common stock therefore our company cannot

investors must review the offering circular for caprocq and sign a subscription agreement attesting that they reviewed the offering circular before making an investment in caprocq caprocq core risk factors prospective investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the companys common stock involves a high and sometimes speculative degree of risk and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate the risks of the investment an investment in our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not paying rent tenants paying rent but who have gone dark properties that need substantial capital improvements andor repositioning in their local markets properties that are not generating income and risks relating to joint venture and coinvestor structures in addition prospective investors must rely solely upon the advisor to identify investment opportunities and to negotiate any debt financing prospective investors who are unwilling to rely solely on the advisor should not invest in our shares each prospective investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering and should consult with his own legal tax and financial advisors with respect thereto prior to investing in shares of the companys common stock examples of a few risks in this offering are the following • upon raising the minimum offering amount we will only own one investment • our advisor may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities • investments in real estaterelated assets can be speculative • adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and as a result our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly prior to this offering there has been no public market for caprocq core reit incs common stock therefore our company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its common stock will develop or be sustained after this offering or how the development of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock for a complete discussion of risks please refer to the

be aware that an investment in shares of the companys common stock involves a high and sometimes speculative degree of risk and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate the risks of the investment an investment in our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not paying rent tenants paying rent but who have gone dark properties that need substantial capital improvements andor repositioning in their local markets properties that are not generating income and risks relating to joint venture and coinvestor structures in addition prospective investors must rely solely upon the advisor to identify investment opportunities and to negotiate any debt financing prospective investors who are unwilling to rely solely on the advisor should not invest in our shares each prospective investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering and should consult with his own legal tax and financial advisors with respect thereto prior to investing in shares of the companys common stock examples of a few risks in this offering are the following • upon raising the minimum offering amount we will only own one investment • our advisor may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities • investments in real estaterelated assets can be speculative • adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and as a result our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly prior to this offering there has been no public market for caprocq core reit incs common stock therefore our company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its common stock will develop or be sustained after this offering or how the development of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock for a complete discussion of risks please refer to the form a a form a offering circular relating to these securities has

factors prospective investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the companys common stock involves a high and sometimes speculative degree of risk and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate the risks of the investment an investment in our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not paying rent tenants paying rent but who have gone dark properties that need substantial capital improvements andor repositioning in their local markets properties that are not generating income and risks relating to joint venture and coinvestor structures in addition prospective investors must rely solely upon the advisor to identify investment opportunities and to negotiate any debt financing prospective investors who are unwilling to rely solely on the advisor should not invest in our shares each prospective investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering and should consult with his own legal tax and financial advisors with respect thereto prior to investing in shares of the companys common stock examples of a few risks in this offering are the following • upon raising the minimum offering amount we will only own one investment • our advisor may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities • investments in real estaterelated assets can be speculative • adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and as a result our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly prior to this offering there has been no public market for caprocq core reit incs common stock therefore our company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its common

for persons or entities that are able to evaluate the risks of the investment an investment in our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not paying rent tenants paying rent but who have gone dark properties that need substantial capital improvements andor repositioning in their local markets properties that are not generating income and risks relating to joint venture and coinvestor structures

respect thereto prior to investing in shares of the companys common stock examples of a few risks in this offering are the following • upon raising the minimum offering amount we will only own one investment • our advisor may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities • investments in real estaterelated assets can be speculative • adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and as a result our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate

legal advisors every crowdfunding website that in any way provides any type of investment information about an issuer in regards to the issuers intentions to raise any type of investment capital where an investor is expected to advance a cash investment to the issuer where the investor has a reasonable expectation of a financial return and where the issuer in return for the cash investment gives the investor securities these “equity crowdfunding platforms” need to be either a registered brokerdealer as defined by the securities act of  or a registered stock exchange with the united states securities and exchange commission as defined in the exchange act of ” “every techy who has built a website for crowdfunding or any unlicensed capital broker can jump up and down about this all day long but the rules today are very clear about this matter may they change in the future maybe… but probably not the grand illusion that the sec is going to allow every tom dick and harry without proper industry experience knowledge examination and license just go runaround as pseudostock brokers and pseudostock exchanges is just plain crazy we have spent the better part of a year working directly with the united states securities  exchange commission in opening what is today the alternative securities market and i can provide you about five hundred pages of written responses from the sec that details this very point and though i do not have much respect for the commission ‘s handling of enforcing the rules set forth by the securities act of  or the exchange act of  we know that the “dday” is coming in the next few months and we are certain that the mandate for all equitycrowd funding sites to either become registeredbroker dealers or registered stock exchanges is on the not so distant horizon this is not a big deal now since most crowdfunding sites are restricted to accredited investors but for sites like the alternative securities market it is a big deal since the

del rey california – the alternative securities markets group corporation today announced that it is launching the asm oil  natural gas market segment to all investors on january th  the alternative securities markets group corporation is the first and only equity crowdfunding company that is currently open to all investors accredited and nonaccredited due to the fact that all issuers on the alternative securities market issue regulation a securities not the highly restricted regulation d securities that are commonly associated with “equity crowdfunding” the alternative securities market was formed in november of  to  operate as both an independent private primary and secondary market for both issuer direct initial public offerings of securities to the investing public and for the

opportunities will be brought out of the ‘dark’ and made available on a true securities market not some shady flyby night crowdfunding webportal founded by someone with no investment backing knowledge or background  the alternative securities market is a private market that gives true transparency to a securities market through strenuous public reporting much like the regulated markets of the nasdaq and new york stock exchange something that goes above and beyond what was encompassed in the  passage of the jobs act all this topped with the announcement that crowdfunding title iii and title iv have been tabled until october of  this will make asmg the only equity crowdfunding company open to accredited and nonaccredited investors for the better part of the next year” twenty other market

securities markets group crowdfunding investment investment banking stock market will the alternative securities market and regulation a reform replace the traditional small cap ipo market november   alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup there has been very little attention drawn to title iv of the jobs act which as proposed would raise the reg a threshold to  million and exempt these offerings from state blue sky laws with the sec comment period for title iv long since passed i wanted to discuss how the alternative securities markets group and “crowdfunding regulation a plus” when combined will transform the small cap equity markets in  and essentially lay waste to the current small cap ipo landscape as we currently know it point one the sec issued proposed regulations for regulation a title iv of the jobs act on december   way ahead of the title iii regulations that are still pending probably the biggest surprise was that the sec came out with proposed rules when they did given all the blogging and crowdfunding news today seems to be focused on title ii the oddest part of title iv of the jobs act is that is the only part of the jobs act dependent on sec rulemaking which did not have any deadline set for the sec to issue rules given the near two plus year delay in title iii crowdfunding rules and the enormous backlog of dodd frank rulemaking going back to  the proposed regulation a rules came as a welcome surprise first to catch up those of you unfamiliar with title iv and the regulation a reform there were two major changes both surprises in the new proposed new rules… the first surprise the content of the proposed rules  this was the biggest surprise but in a very positive way the position the sec has taken on blue sky preemption for offerings between  million and  million the socalled “regulation a tier ” essentially it has taken the position that all investors in a tier  offering both accredited and unaccredited are “qualified purchasers” – effectively meaning that  a company can open up its offering to all investors in a tier  offering and still be exempt from state blue sky review the other surprise also involved blue sky preemption for tier  offerings capped at  million the sec has requested comment on whether tier  should also be preempted from all blue sky review  the issue of preempting blue sky review for raises below  million the original ceiling for “old” regulation a was never directly addressed by congress in the jobs act – the focus of congress was on pushing the ceiling up to  million and allowing for blue sky preemption for the higher amounts – but adding in ongoing reporting requirements   point two biggest unknowns faced by companies under the regulation a rules in their proposed form the alternative securities market when coupled with regulation a have a huge potential for revitalizing the smaller ipo market — provided regulation a operates as proposed — a disclosure regime which is lighter than required by fully reporting companies and an “alleged streamlined” sec registration review process this is not currently the case with current regulation a submissions to the sec currently companies daring to do regulation a registrations with the sec are experiencing review times equal if not greater than s ipo registration statements a big unknown regardless of how final rules look is what we can expect from the sec in the regulation a review process in the future when the new regulations go live currently in  the average time spent in registration at the sec for regulation a securities registration was about nine months  some of this may have been part of a retooling process by us at the alternative securities market and at the sec who was not equipped to handle the surge of new regulation a filings currently the alternative securities markets group is experiencing roughly  days in initial regulation a submission responses and about  days for amended filings qualification timelines can vary upon multiple factors but a standard expectation should be  days given our almost six months of operations in working with the sec on regulation a public offering submissions the public statements by the commission and the overall tenor of the proposed rules is that the sec is expecting the new regulation a to be a robust method of funding  it is the expectation of the alternative securities markets group that with proper representation by sec and what appears to be strong sec support for this new  million exemption issuers can reasonably expect regulation a to ultimately perform as advertised – as a streamlined miniipo point  with regulation a being open to all investors what can be done to make regulation a offerings more competitive against the traditional small cap ipo i came up with a few things tier  offerings cannot be competitive with other alternatives unless and until blue sky regulations are preempted  in previous postings i have debated the other side of the coin on this point and i may be on the other side of the fence on this tomorrow the simple fact is for me at the alternative securities market the preempted scenario works best for me but investment banking organizations finra and the nasaa are all weighing in on this matter and the the sec has asked for comment on this so presumably they believe they have the power to do this through rulemaking but even the sec is not sure of what their stance is on this point the second thing the sec needs to do in final rulemaking is raise the ceiling on tier  offerings from  million to perhaps  million when regulation a was enacted the  million cap was reasonable in  there are just not many small cap companies that tier  offerings make sense for and finally a point i rarely speak on as companies on the alternative securities market already agree to public reporting that generally exceeds the public reporting required under regulation a with that said with tier  offerings the limit on the number of shareholders before full reporting requirements are triggered ought to be modified the current ongoing reporting requirement for tier  semi annual or quarterly versus full reporting only remains in effect until a company exceeds the caps currently set for the number of total shareholders –  unaccredited investors or  accredited investors  unless the sec modifies its proposed rules companies will face difficulties including a significant number of persons who wish to invest smaller amounts of money – those more likely to be unaccredited investors  this defeats one of the purposes of regulation a – allowing a company to do a miniipo by going out to a large group of investors let’s do some math   unaccredited investors each investing an average of  – that’s  million to the company – and they have already hit the  shareholder cap and that’s on the low end of an exemption available for up to  million  something needs to give here unfortunately this is not an item being debated by the sec currently and does not seem to be an item to be addressed before enactment for regulation a whenever that may be point  is the alternative securities market the new competition for the otc markets group given the pending closure of the otcbb if the sec were to exempt tier  offerings from blue sky regulations like with the proposed tier  and modify the shareholder caps both of which were already done by congress in title iii of the jobs act and combine that with a vehicle like the alternative securities market we have the potential for investment crowdfunding in overdrive if an direct initial public offering up to  million on the alternative securities market with a regulation a offering is  much less complex than and otc market listing  tens of thousands of dollars cheaper than an otc market listing and  gives the shareholder the same liquidity in the securities being issued to investors why would an issuer ever go to the otc markets for a small cap ipo the only answer is “market liquidity” the major drawback of regulation a offerings in the current crowdfunding landscape is “barrier of entry” for crowdfunding websites or crowdfunding securities markets the otc markets group today rules the otc market landscape and will only grow its stranglehold on the market given finra’s recent announcement that it will be closing the otcbb leaving the otc markets group to rule unchallenged mr cromwell coulson president and ceo of the otc markets group obviously becomes a focal point of this whole equity crowdfunding landscape as one of the biggest issues that may “investment market industry professionals” have with both regulation a and title iii of the jobs act is the fact that the proposed legislation did not have a clearly spelled out mechanism for how there would be a freely traded exchange of the regulation a and title iii equity securities the current rules for regulation a securities is that once an issuer sells a regulation a security to an investor the shares are issues unrestricted and able to be immediately sold traded or transferred unless restricted due to the issuer being a rule  shell company by definition and the proposed rules for title iii state that once an investor invests in title iii securities they must hold on to them for one year before they can sell once the year is up however there is no clear guidance on how the sale to a new buyer will take place so up and to the evolution of the alternative securities market this came down to the otc markets group the otc markets group has it three tiers to choose from the otcqx the otcqb and the otc pink you can get more information at wwwotcmarketscom out of the three options the otc pink marketplace is going to generally be the most popular choice for most regulation a and title iii issuers this option is the “least costly” in terms of otc market listings to issuers of crowdfunded securitiies to comply with of course regardless of if a company becomes capitalized through crowdfunding or intends to do a small cap ipo in order to gain capitalization on the otc market there are the dreaded otc listing steps a company must complete in order to list on the otc marketplace to become an otcqx otcqb or otc pink company at least one brokerdealer must quote the company’s securities on otc link® ats otc link® ats is operated by otc link llc an secregistered alternative trading system ats and finra member brokerdealer wholly owned by otc markets group unlike on stock exchanges or the alternative securities market for that matter companies do not list their own stock for trading rather brokerdealers begin quoting new securities on otc link® ats by submitting a form  with the financial industry regulatory authority finra in some cases there may be an exemption available that permits a brokerdealer to begin quoting a stock without filing a form  generally this happens when the brokerdealer is already quoting the stock on another platform or if the brokerdealer is only representing an unsolicited customer order not making a market of course there are the dreaded costs of filing an s or a form  registration statement costs of the required financial audit costs of retaining a stock transfer agent and clearing “dtc” and then you get the otc market upfront application cost of  with an annual fee to be on the market of  for otcqb the costs for the otcqx is a  application fee and  annual fee most companies can expect to have a total out of pocket expense in the range of  to  so why all of this information the answer is a simple one alternative securities market listed companies can enjoy all the comforts of doing an ipo of freetrading shares without all the costs and without all of the mindnumbing paperwork required for an otc market listing investors get the same market transparency and liquidity in their holdings as they would have on the otc market can this spell the end of the otc markets group lets do the math otc market ipo of free trading shares below are just estimates for exact number you will need to contact industry professionals working in the below related fields legal preparation and filing of an sc s

alternative securities market      it is this fact with strong financial backing from investors the alternative securities market in  will quickly become a fierce competitor for the otc markets group   closing point with what we believe is the last legal opinion  legal comment letter from the sec issued last week we are assured we will be open to all private and institutional investors on january th  this might be six months later than anticipated but we delayed our opening six months to continue coordinated efforts in working with the sec to be the very first “legal equity crowdfunding marketplace” that provides the very best products and services to both issuers and to investors the small businesses in america need the alternative securities market as a “source of capital formation” the future economy stands to gain significantly from crowdfunding and companies like the alternative securities markets group corporation and those that will copy us and potentially improve upon our processes in the future i am happy to announce that on january th  when the alternative securities market opens its doors to investors we will only then begin to see economic prosperity spread to all demographics of the global population and have it done in one of the most transparent marketplaces available mr steven j muehler founder  chief executive officer alternative securities

alternativesecuritiesmarket search search for crowdfunding investment investment banking stock market what is the purpose of a stock market and how did we lose our way november   alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup contrary to popular belief or even as portrayed on tv or in the movies the stock markets are not the nerve center of capitalism they are nothing more than tools to facilitate the buying and selling of shares today’s stock markets are primarily about speculating on the future prices of those shares largely disconnected from real investment or what goes on in the real economy of goods and services it’s time for all investors from private individual investors to large pension funds to reconnect with businesses in a longterm relationship through a new investment architecture stock exchanges were originally conceived for the public interest and had a clear public purpose “to allow companies to raise equity from a large pool of investors and to provide a market for investors to later sell their shares in those companies”   the promise of a liquid market lowered the cost of that equity to enterprise thereby increasing economic growth and theoretically at least shared prosperity but capital formation is only a small part of what happens on stock markets today yes successful stock offerings provide the avenue for venture capitalists to recycle investments made in private markets back into new innovative young enterprises but it is shortterm speculation in stocks aided by the increased speed of information flow that has grown like a cancer into a big business of little real value and now dominates stock market activity most investors especially those large institutional investors who sing the praises of market liquidity are more often than not just selfinterested speculators indeed recent history has shown that our worldleading liquid markets are also the source of extreme global instability with dire and ongoing consequences nonetheless this trader ideology remains stubbornly at the heart of our shorttermobsessed finance capitalism which left unchecked surely will lead us to economic social and ecological collapse six factors have combined to make our equity capital markets no longer fit for purpose the privatization of large national stock exchanges destroying their public purpose mandate and instead making the growth of trading volume their singleminded goal and highfrequency traders computers programmed to trade their preferred customers the unrestrained technology arms race in computing power combined with the adoption of technologydriven information flow spurring the rapid acceleration of trading volume which at critical times can be highly destabilizing the misguided ascent of “shareholder wealth maximization” at the expense of all other stakeholder interests in our business schools board rooms and the corporate finance departments on wall street the wellintended but equally misguided practice of using stockbased incentives and stock options in particular as the dominant form of senior management compensation which incentivizes them to focus only on shortterm results at the expense of the longterm health of the enterprise people and planet the misalignment of interests between shortterm focused intermediaries and real investors such as pension funds whose timeframe should be measured in decades regulators’ lack of courage and confidence to counter the traderdriven paradigm and institute substantive structural reform such as a financial transaction tax and other reforms that would penalize excessive speculation while incentivizing longterm productive investment rather than limit themselves to this deeply flawed system alternative securities market investors aka “real investors” can build direct relationships with enterprise in negotiated innovative mutually beneficial partnerships that are truly aligned with both parties’ longterm goals including the harmonization of financial environmental social and governance imperatives alternative securities market investors are able to target mature early stage and growth stage microcap and smallcap companies that are often unappreciated by growthobsessed equity capital markets they can disprove the myth that growth at the expense of the environment or employees is the only path to adequate financial returns the cash flows of these businesses may not exhibit the in our view often unsustainable growth characteristics equity investors have been trained to desire but they are far more dependable sources of financial return than speculationdriven capital markets that resiliency is what alternative securities market investors will value most in an increasingly uncertain future with growing resource and fiscal constraints hampering economic growth particularly in the developed economies the burning question is whether the alternative securities market investment methodology detailed here can be scaled up as

comment mr steven j muehler founder and ceo of the alternative securities markets group writes and open letter to the united states securities  exchange commission regarding crowdfunding reform and the repeal of the proposed rules for crowdfunding title iii tuesday august th  beverly hills california – in an email released to the public today a letter written on august th  by alternative securities markets group founder and chief executive officer mr steven j muehler to the united states securities  exchange commission echoes the call for changes to both the current and proposed rules and regulations that encompass what is commonly referred to as “crowdfunding” in the letter mr muehler has taken a position of great concern to the “average joe investors” and those concerns are similar to the concerns voiced my members of the nasaa finra and many investment banking firms and associations nationwide in the letter below mr muehler calls for four very specific rule changes that are required to allow the crowdfunding industry to both flourish but under the proper regulation of securities regulators one major point of emphasis is the total repeal of crowdfunding title iii the letter dated august th  is below in its entirety and is also able to be viewed with additional information athttpwwwstevemuehlercom and httpwwwalternativesecuritiesmarketcom to united states securities and exchange commission  f street northeast washington dc  and united states securities and exchange commission los angeles regional office  wilshire blvd th floor los angeles california  dear united states securities and exchange commission members i wanted to write this brief letter to you first thanking you for taking the time to meet and speak with me this coming tuesday august th  about the operations of the alternative securities markets group and about the current crowdfunding marketplace i also want to thank you for taking the time to review our company’s website at httpwwwalternativesecuritiesmarketcom and for taking the time to speak with a large number of the company’s on the alternative securities market venture market the alternative securities market main market and the alternative securities market global private market along with all of this information you gathered about the operations of the alternative securities market and the companies associated with our market i also wanted to take a brief moment to write about our company’s position on the current “crowdfunding industry” the jumpstart our business startups act the “jobs act” directed the united states securities and exchange commission to come up with regulations to help revitalize the sec’s regulation a registration exemption under the securities act of  mainly to increase the maximum offering from the current  usd to  usd without going through the sec’s securities registration process using regulation a especially for local real estate investments is now becoming a trend in the “real estate crowdfunding” industry with groups like fundrise who did three total applications in  and groundfloor who did less than fundrise but are expected to each increase their number of regulation a filings in  the current ‘gripe’ for years about the lack of use of regulation a is that state approval is needed to be able to take advantage of this regulation in its current capacity and the costs associated with state regulations generally ranging from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars per state hence only  regulation a registrations were filed in all of  since april st  to august th  i have personally authored and submitted the the sec more than  regulation a securities registration statements for review comment and qualification the proposed regulations for regulation a “plus” offerings released in december of  by the united states securities  exchange commission was at much disappointment to myself as well as the nasaa “north american securities administrators association” the proposed framework included a provision where state regulators would retain registration authority only for regulation a filings under the current regulation a of  million or less to be known as regulation a tier i and where state regulators would not retain authority for regulation a filings of  to  million since the passage of the jobs act the state regulators have reworked a “coordinated review and registration system” among its members to collectively register regulation a offerings so that the registration statements can be reviewed and approved by state regulators in a timely fashion it was this extra step after sec review and qualification and the costs associated with it comment and qualification that steered many companies away from regulation a these extra time delays and extra costs of regulation a is the chief reason for the popular use by issuers of private placement offering exemptions under regulation d was to avoid both state and fedearl registrations reviews and the extra time and costs associated with it because of my role with the alternative securities markets group and on air with “steve muehler on the corner of main street and wall street” i find myself at the literal epicenter of the whole crowdfunding industry i have been literally overrun with calls and emails from small business owner  entrepreneurs and absolutely overwhelmed with countless business plans and private placement memorandums from companies that have been “crowdfunding” under regulation d with no success for many various reasons that have conacted myself about conducting a regulation a securities offering to date i have only engaged with about  of the companies that have contacted me both from a capacity of being able to do the work required in a time frame that is acceptable to the client and also i was not  in support of the company or its business plan it is because of my unique position in this whole crowdfunding space that i make the following suggestings about “reform” to the crowdfunding industry as it relates to current and proposed changes to the aspects of regulation a and regulation d increased barriers of entry for companies seeking to solicit investments publicly for regulation d securities under rules  and  because of the escalated risks associated with public solicitation especially given the rise of nonindustry related participants launching “crowdfunding” and “capital raising” websites that provide absolutely no due diligence in the companies that are soliciting for investment through these websites it is suggested that all companies seeking to sell regulation d securities in a public solicitation format under rules  and  need to be required to submit a registration statement to the sec on sec form a or an alternate form to be created for a complete merit review by an examiner with the sec and that all state blue sky registrations be completed by the company prior to starting any public solicitation for the sale of the securities because this is a simple process and requires minimum capital expenditures on the part of the company there should be no “test the waters” periods prior to the registration of the regulation d to the securities and exchange commission because it is my belief that the barrier of entry for companies seeking to sell securities publicly under regulation d rules  and  to accredited investors only should be less than those seeking to publicly sell securities to all investors accredited and nonaccredited under regulation a it is suggested that the filing of unaudited or audited financial statements to the sec at the time of registration should not apply to regulation d filings this merit review should be only to ensure that all necessary information required to be given to any potential investor under regulation d has been properly disclosed and that all members of the company’s management are not part of the “bad actors” definition and that if they are that proper public disclosure is given as part of this all “crowdfunding” websites that market and advertise companies selling securities under regulation d regulation s andor regulation a need to be required to ensure that all federal and state approvals are complete prior to allowing any public solicitations each of the “crowdfunding” websites should also be required to provide links to the sec edgar page that shows all filings of the company that is soliciting for investment it is felt that this change is necessary and should be made in the best interest of the general investing public  increased regulation of unlicensed brokers soliciting investments on behalf of companies for which the broker is not a member of and soliciting investors on a performance based commission agreement illegal under current rules and regulations needs dramatic reform since the fallout of the mortgage and real estate markets the “venture capital brokerage” industry has become oversaturated with unlicensed “regulation d stock brokers” soliciting investments for companies seeking capital under regulation d most of these unlicensed “venture capital brokers” have very limited knowledge of the basic rules regulations and securities markets place private or public and are soliciting these highly speculative and highly risky securities to all forms of investors as safe investments in my view the current standard for marketing securities for sale under regulation d regulation s andor “crowdfunding” is “to high” of a standard to state that only “licensed broker dealers” can sell securities of a company and that the standard for someone wanting to sell securities pursuant to regulation d regulation s andor “crowdfunding” and said broker is not part of a licensed broker dealer is to high of a standard for a broker seeking to gain entry into the industry as part of a suggestion to introduce both control and regulation into this aspect of a fast growing marketplace it is suggested that a ‘limited broker’s license’ or a smiliar designation be created under this ‘limited broker’s license’ a broker seeking to sell securities for a single company on a performance commission basis can file for this ‘limited broker’s license’ through finra or the sec or through a state securities regulator as part of the filing the broker will submit a copy of the sec approved regulation d or regulation s investment prospectus as discussed in the point above along with the application for the ‘limited broker license’ along with any fees that may apply for this limited broker’s license as long as the broker applying for license meets the minimum background check standards that will be applied for approval of a ‘limited broker licenses’ and the broker or the company issuing the scurities submits and bonds or assurances that may be required the broker will then be able to publicly market and solicit investment for that single company per the terms and conditions represented in the filed and approved securities registration statement and per the terms of the limited broker’s license this simple change will both bring regulation to a segment of the market that is overrun with unlicensed brokers marketing and attempting to sell securities without proper license and in violation of both federal and state laws and also give a lower barrier of entry to those seeking to work in this industry and cannot either gain employment with a licensed broker dealer or cannot take the time necessary to go through months of exams to become a licensed securities professional it is felt that this change is necessary to give entry to a new group of industry professionals wanting to work in an industry that may not currently be accessible to them and should be made in the best interest of the general investing public the states must retain registration authority for both proposed tier i and tier ii regulation a offerings with the implementation of the nasaa coordinated review and registration program the state regulators have collectively introduced a time effective and hassle free state registration process where each issuer’s regulation a registration statement will be reviewed and approved by state regulators in a timely fashion there has been reports that the nasaa and the sec commissioners have been in contact on this new coordinated review and registration process and it is possible at this time that the final regulations will not include the preemption of state securities registration requirements for regulation a plus tier ii offerings ie those regulation a offerings from  to the new proposed maximum  million crowdfunding title iii  of the jobs act must never be enacted crowdfunding title iii of the jobs act must never be enacted any company engaging in public solicitation for the sale of securities to the general invsting public accredited and nonaccredited investors must go through the same registration review comment and approval process like that associated with a regualtion a securities offering in regulation a crowdfunding title iii is already essentially in action those not wishing to go through the registration review comment and qualification process should not be allowed to publicly solicit investments from nonaccredited investors it is just that simple this is simple common sense and in the best interest of the the general investing public again i thank you for taking the time to review this information and i look

subscription agreement attesting that they reviewed the offering circular before making an investment in caprocq caprocq core risk factors prospective investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the companys common stock involves a high and sometimes speculative degree of risk and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate the risks of the investment an investment in our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment prospective investors should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to purchase shares it is impossible to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares of the companys common stock because of general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate the risks associated with the types of properties the company intends to acquire and certain tax risks among other risks these risks may be exacerbated by the additional risks associated with the specific properties that the company acquires and the ownership structure of the investment such specific risks include but are not limited to high vacancy rates tenants in possession but not paying rent tenants paying rent but who have gone dark properties that need substantial capital improvements andor repositioning in their local markets properties that are not generating income and risks relating to joint venture and coinvestor structures in addition prospective investors must rely solely upon the advisor to identify investment opportunities and to negotiate any debt financing prospective investors who are unwilling to rely solely on the advisor should not invest in our shares each prospective investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering and should consult with his own legal tax and financial advisors with respect thereto prior to investing in shares of the companys common stock examples of a few risks in this offering are the following • upon raising the minimum offering amount we will only own one investment • our advisor may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities • investments in real estaterelated assets can be speculative • adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and as a result our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize appreciation in the value of our investments • reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity • we may have conflicts of interest with our advisor and other affiliates which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders • we have used and may continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness which increases our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments • a limit on the percentage of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business combination which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium price for their stock • the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly prior to this offering there has been no public market for
