status  passive participant in the swift network what is a swift code swift codes are used to identify banks and financial institutions worldwide they are used by the swift network to transmit wire transfers money transactions and messages between them for international wire transfers swift codes are always required in order to make transactions secure and fast these codes were initially introduced by the swift organization as “swift codes” but were later standardized by the international organization for standardization iso as “bic” meaning “business identifier codes” most people think bic stands for “bank identifier codes” “bank” instead of “business” but that is incorrect since nonfinancial institutions can also join the swift network a “bic code” can be seen by many different names like “swift code” most common “swift id” “swiftbic” “swift address” “bei” that comes from “business entity identifier” or even “iso ” which is the standard format that has been approved by the iso organization the acronym swift stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication in depth analysis of a swift code swift codes are broken down into sections in the same way telephone numbers are broken into sections and every section reveals some information about the institution that was assigned this code they consist of eight or eleven characters whenever an eightcharacter code is used then it is referring to the headquarters main office of the institutionhere is how an character code is broken down and what each section of characters represents lets take this imaginary character swift code aaaabbccddd it can be broken down to these sections aaaa – bb – cc  ddd section  the first characters “aaaa” this code is used to identify the institution’s global presence all branches and all divisions around the world for example “chas” is used for “jpmorgan chase bank” section  th and th characters “bb” this twoletter code represents the country of this particular institution’s branch and follows the iso  alpha standard for representing country codes for example “us” for “united states” “gb” for “united kingdom” ca for “canada” etc section  th and th characters “cc” these characters represent a location code eg “ff” is the code for “frankfurt” “kk” is the code for copenhagen etc and also the second character th in the bic sometimes carries this information if it is equal to “” then it typically is a bic assigned for testing purposes as opposed to a bic used on the live network if it is equal to “” then it denotes a passive participant in the swift network if it is equal to  then it typically denotes a “reverse billing” bic meaning that the recipient of the message has to pay for the message section  th to th characters “ddd” these final three characters form a “branch code” that refers to the particular branch of the institution if this section is omitted then we have an character swift code that is assumed to refer to the head office of the institution also a typical naming convention is that in the case we are referring to the main offices of an institution this branch code is “xxx” some

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
