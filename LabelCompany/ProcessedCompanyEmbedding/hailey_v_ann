chief justice radack and justices keyes and alcalaleta j womack womack  womack houston tx for appellant jay m wright conroe tx for appellee opinionhusband timothy hailey appeals from a judgment awarding wife cecelia hailey the greater portion of their community estate in their divorce trial   in his first three issues husband contends that the trial court abused its discretion by not dividing the property in a just and right manner by not manifesting a due regard for husbands rights and by not awarding husband onehalf of the communitys economic contribution to wifes separate estate   in his fourth issue husband asserts that the trial courts conclusion of law concerning the community estates claims for reimbursement against his separate estate is erroneous   husband complains of cumulative error in his fifth issue   we affirmbackgroundhusband and wife were married on march   and permanently separated less than two and a half years later in october    before their final separation the couple separated for six weeks during the summer of    no children were born of or supported by the marriagehusband and wife were both in their thirties when they married   at that time wifes separate estate consisted primarily of the following  employee stock and an employee profitsharing plan worth approximately  equity of approximately  in a house and personal property   husband owned a house with equity of approximately  at the time of marriage as well as personal property   they chose to reside in wifes house and leased husbands houseboth husband and wife worked during the marriage   but although husband worked as an independent contractor in the airconditioner repair business he reported a net income of only  during the first year of marriage no income the second year and a net loss the third year   wife earned an average salary of  annually as a comptroller for the company for which she had worked for over  yearswife filed for divorce on june   and husband countersued three months later   neither petition asserted fault   the trial courts judgment separated the community estate by ordering that  wife and husband each be separately responsible for the attorneys fees they incurred during the divorce proceedings and that  the remainder of the community property be divided as shown belowwifes award of community propertywife received a value of  in assets that had been part of the community estate as follows  the communityestate debt that was assigned to wife totaled  for the following debts  foleys for  first usa bank for  bank card service for  and capital one for    after subtracting the community debt assigned to wife from the community assets awarded to wife wifes net award totaled husbands award of community propertyhusband received a value of  in assets that had been part of the community estate as followsonly two debts that belonged to the community estate first usa visa for  and chase platinum visa for  were awarded to husband for a total of    thus the total net award for husband was the effect of the net distribution of the estate was approximately a  division of property in favor of wife in its conclusion of law number two the trial court stated that the “division of the property of wife and husband effected by the final judgment is just and right having due regard for the rights of each party irrespective of the characterization of any item of property as either community or separate”division of community propertyin his first issue husband contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to divide the community estate in a just and right manner and by awarding an approximate  division of the community estate to wife after having previously stated that it would divide the property “close to a  split”   in issue two husband complains that the trial court awarded “essentially all” of the community assets to wife and abused its discretion by failing to manifest a due regard for his rights in a decree of divorce the court shall order a division of the community estate in a manner that the court deems just and right having due regard for the rights of each party  tex famcode ann §  vernon   rafferty v finstad  swd   texapphouston st dist  writ denied   in effecting a just and right division of the community estate section  of the family code vests the trial court with broad discretion that will not be reversed on appeal unless the complaining party shows that the trial court clearly abused its discretion   murff v murff  swd   tex  rafferty  swd at    the test of whether the trial court abused its discretion is whether the court acted arbitrarily or unreasonably and without reference to any guiding principles  downer v aquamarine operators inc  swd   tex  rafferty  swd at    it is the duty of the appellate court to presume that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in dividing the marital estate  murff  swd at  a trial court may order an unequal division of the community property when a reasonable basis exists for granting that relief   robles v robles  swd   texapphouston st dist  pet denied   the division of property must not be so disproportionate as to be inequitable and the circumstances must justify awarding more than onehalf to one party  patt v patt  swd   texapphouston st dist  no writ   relevant factors in the division of the marital estate include  the education of the parties  their relative earning capacities  the size of their separate estates and  the nature of the community property  murff  swd at   alsenz v alsenz  swd   texapphouston st dist  pet deniededucation of the parties husband has more formal education than wife he received a degree in agronomy turfgrass science from texas a  m university in  and education in airconditioning repair as a  graduate from houston community college   wife completed only one year of college following high school   because husbands formal education empowers him to obtain gainful employment at wages exceeding wifes this factor favors wifes receiving a greater share of the community propertyrelative earning capacityalthough wife earned more income than husband at an average wage of  annually the record suggests that husbands earnings could have exceeded wifes   husband could have earned much as  in the airconditioningrepair business alone but husband also had his own landscaping business and worked parttime in the carwash business   wifes salary appears to have peaked based on her employment for the past  years for the same company after working her way up from receptionist to comptroller   moreover wife testified that she may need to seek a lower position at the company and take a pay cut to reduce workrelated stress   because husband has the earning capacity to exceed wifes wages this factor favors wifes receiving a greater share of the community estatesize of separate estateshusband and wife both owned houses prior to marriage and wife had slightly more equity in her house when they married  husband also had more creditcard debt than wife at    because of wifes employee stock and profitsharing plan however her separate estate greatly outweighs husbands  thus although husband was capable of earning more money than wife due to his formal education wife had developed a considerably larger separate estate than husband before marriage   because wifes separate estate is more valuable than husbands this factor favors husbands receiving a greater share of the community propertynature of community propertyas reflected in the trial courts finding of fact number four the community estate consists primarily of the community interest in wifes employee stockownership plan valued at  and the profitsharing plan valued at  for a total of    in addition the community estate had a total value of  for the community estates  claim for economic contribution for community funds spent to enhance the value of wifes house and the community estates claim for reimbursement for  from the separate estate of husband   the remaining community assets included the  dodge ram truck with an equity valued at   the state farm life insurance policy valued at   and the washington mutual bank account valued at wife contends that she is entitled to a greater share of the community estate because she earned the vast majority of the income brought into the community estate   husband contends that wife interfered with his ability to work by imposing a curfew on him that required him to be home by  pm on weekdays and  pm on weekends   husband also contends that although his tax records show net losses he routinely deposited money into the community estate and gave the community estate the benefit of depreciation for some of his property in joint tax returns   wife denied placing a curfew on husband and claimed that he was voluntarily underemployed   we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by impliedly finding that this factor favors wifes receiving a greater share of the community propertyconclusionapplication of the murff factors supports the trial courts having properly exercised its discretion to award wife a greater share of the community estate in dividing the property in a “just and right” manner   see murff  swd at    the record shows that husband and wife are in their thirties that they are physically and mentally able and that each is capable of earning over  annually   although highly educated and capable of earning over  annually husband reported less than  in income during the marriage   the couple lived in wifes house and were supported by wifes income   wifes income paid for the benefits to wifes and husbands separate estates   under the circumstances the division of property was not so disproportionate as to be inequitable and the circumstances justify awarding more than half of the community estate to wife see patt  swd at  in conducting a bench trial of a divorce case the trial court has the opportunity to observe the parties determine their credibility and evaluate their needs and potential both social and economic  murff  swd at    similarly as the trier of fact the trial court is empowered to apply its understanding and experience  mathematical precision in dividing property in a divorce is usually not possible  id  given the wide latitude and discretion vested in the trial court which we may disturb only in a case of clear abuse id we cannot conclude under the circumstances presented here that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding wife a greater share of the community estate“close to a  split” in support of his first issue husband further contends that because the trial court stated in its closing remarks that “it works out that it is close to a  split and im going to leave the parties as they sit today” the trial court erred by instead dividing the property closer to a  division   the trial courts remarks however are not reflected in its findings of fact conclusions of law or judgment   accordingly they are not dispositive   see in re wer  swd   tex   rather the trial courts conclusions of law and judgment properly refer only to the just and right division of the property mandated by section  of the family code see tex famcode ann §   rafferty  swd at    accordingly husbands contention does not conflict with our conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding wife a greater share of the community estate in effecting its just and right distribution of the community estate we overrule husbands issue one “essentially all” community assets to wife in his second issue husband complains that wife was awarded “essentially all” of the community assets   husband ignores that the community estates considerable debt was also assigned to wife although she received most of the community assets wife also received most of the community debt   accordingly we reject husbands contention that wife received “essentially all” of the community assets and affirm our conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its just and right distribution of the community estatewe overrule husbands issue tworeimbursement award against husbands estatethe reimbursement award stems from a claim by the community estate for compensation for community funds spent during the marriage on the house that husband owned before the marriage   in conclusions of law number four and five the trial court assessed a value of  for the reimbursement claim made by the community estate   the community estates entire reimbursement award valued at  was awarded to husband as his sole propertyhusband challenges the assessed value of  for the reimbursement claim in issue four   specifically husband claims that the record does not support the trial courts conclusions of law regarding the community estates claims for reimbursement against his separate estate and contends that the reimbursement award should be set aside the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in response to husbands request   husband did not offer proposed findings and did not propose additional or amended findings after the trial court adopted the findings proposed by wife see texr civ p     in an appeal from a bench trial we review a trial courts conclusions of law as legal questions de novo and will uphold them on appeal if the judgment can be sustained on any legal theory supported by the evidence  bmc software belgium v marchand  swd   tex  in re moers  swd   texapphouston st dist  no pet   an appellant may not challenge a trial courts conclusions of law for factual sufficiency but we may review the legal conclusions drawn from the facts to determine their correctness  bmc software belgium  swd at    if we determine that a conclusion of law is erroneous but that the trial court nevertheless rendered the proper judgment the error does not require reversal  id when as here the appellate record contains a complete reporters record we review the trial courts findings of fact under the same standards for legal and factual sufficiency that govern review of jury findings   see min v avila  swd   texapphouston st dist  no pet   the trial court acts as factfinder and is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses in a bench trial   see murff  swd at   southwestern bell media inc v lyles  swd   texapphouston st dist  writ denied   accordingly the trial court may consider all the facts and circumstances in connection with the testimony of each witness and accept or reject all or part of that testimony   an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for the trial courts assessment of witnesses testimony in a bench trial   see in re wer  swd at  when the trial courts findings of fact address a ground of recovery or defense but inadvertently omit an essential element we may infer the omitted element pursuant to rule  of the rules of civil procedure because the judgment is presumed valid   see texr civ p   vickery v commn for lawyer discipline  swd   texapphouston th dist  pet denied  see also vickery  swd at  noting that presumptive validity of judgment may apply even more strongly in bench trial   we emphasize moreover that the value of specific items of property is not an ultimate issue in the trial courts property division and does not require specific fact findings by the trial court  rafferty  swd at husband challenges the following two conclusions of law  the community estate has claims for reimbursement against the separate estate of husband in the amount of  as part of a just and right division of the assets and liabilities of the marriage husband is awarded the community property claim against his separate property of husband challenges the conclusions of law concerning the reimbursement claim on the following grounds   wife offered no evidence to support her claim for  in improvements to his house   the total paid by the community towards his house was  rather than    the trial court did not offset  in benefits to the community estate from rent of husbands house and  the trial court did not offset benefits valued at  for depreciation of his house that was taken on the couples  joint tax return   the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law but addressed these issues solely in its conclusions of law without entering separate findings in a decree of divorce the court shall determine the rights of both spouses in a claim for reimbursement and shall apply equitable principles to  determine whether to recognize the claim after taking into account all the relative circumstances of the spouses  and  order a division of the claim for reimbursement if appropriate in a manner that the court considers just and right having due regard for the rights of each party  tex famcode ann § b  vernon    the trial courts discretion in evaluating a claim for reimbursement is as broad as its discretion to effect a just and proper division of the community estate  penick v penick  swd   tex  alsenz  swd at  a party claiming the right of reimbursement must plead and prove that the expenditures and improvements were made and that they are reimbursable  vallone v vallone  swd   tex   the trial court must consider the facts and circumstances and determine what is just fair and equitable  penick  swd at    the trial court is accorded great latitude in applying equitable principles to value a claim for reimbursement  id at  claims for reimbursement may be offset against each other if the court determines that this is appropriate  tex famcode ann § c vernon    a trial court is required to consider offsetting benefits when a litigant requests that relief  gutierrez v gutierrez  swd   texappsan antonio  no writfact findings support a reimbursement claim for an additional on reviewing the record we discern that finding of fact number nine supports a reimbursement claim to the community estate valued at  rather than the  that was awarded in conclusions of law numbers four and five   according to finding of fact number nine the community disbursed  in community funds for husbands separate property as follows   for insurance taxes and mortgage payments on husbands house  for improvements to husbands house  for supplies for husbands house  for utilities for husbands house  for repairs to husbands house  for the separate creditcard debt that husband incurred before the marriage and  for payments made on the state farm life insurance policy that husband owned before the marriage   these findings thus show that husband owed the community estate  more than he was ordered to pay as reimbursement to the community estatesufficiency challenges to findings of fact husband contends that wife offered no evidence to support her claim for  for improvements to his house as shown in finding of fact number nine   the record reflects however that wifes “trial inventory and appraisement” was admitted into evidence and established that the community estate spent  on improvements to husbands house   as well wifes testimony referred to a new roof paint and new flooring as improvements made to husbands house   husband has not demonstrated on appeal why this evidence is insufficient to establish that  was spent on improvements to his house   we overrule husbands challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence concerning the  in expenditures for improvements to his house husband further asserts that the total paid by the community estate towards his house was  rather than the  shown in the trial courts finding of fact number nine   husband suggests that the community estate is entitled to only  for the mortgage payments made on his house   wifes “trial inventory and appraisement” however corresponds to the trial courts finding of fact number nine and thus supports that the community estate spent a total of  for husbands house for the following   for insurance taxes and mortgage payments   for improvements   for supplies   for utilities and  for repairs   we overrule husbands challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence concerning the  in expenditures by the community estate on his houseoffset for deduction on tax returnhusband complains that he did not receive the offsets to which he was entitled because the trial court did not allow him credit for  for the rental income that the community received from his house and credit for the  deduction for the depreciation of his house taken by the community on its  joint tax return   the trial courts findings of fact and conclusions of law do not specifically mention offsets but do address reimbursements to the separate estates   accordingly we may infer omitted findings in support of the trial courts judgment   see texr civ p   vickery  swd at  husband claims that he was entitled to an offset for the  deduction for the depreciation to his house taken on the communitys  joint tax return   the record shows that husband admitted that he owed the internal revenue service  in taxes from his  tax return which resulted in a deduction in that amount from his  tax return filed jointly with wife but even if husband were entitled to an offset for the  deduction for the depreciation to his house on the  joint tax return it appears from the record that he received a benefit from the community estate for his  tax return pertaining to his separate estate   the record thus supports the trial courts failure to award husband an offset for the depreciation of his house on the  joint tax returnoffset for rents received from lease of husbands house the record reflects that husband and wife agreed that the total amount the community received in rent from the lease of husbands house was    wife contends that the trial court disallowed the offset for the rental receipts from husbands house for two reasons   wife first contends that because the community estate received no rental payments from the lease of husbands house after october  when the couple separated the community estate never benefited from the separate property after that date   wife also contends that husband was not entitled to an offset for rental payments received before their final separation because husband used the rental receipts of  a month to pay  a month for his truck note  the record shows that husband and wife married on march   separated for six weeks during the summer of  and finally separated in october    when husband and wife married husbands house was empty until it was repaired and was rented to a tenant in october    wife testified that she did not see any rental receipts after the couple separated in october    thus according to wife only one years worth of rental receipts valued at  a month for a total of  was actually placed into the community estate   although husband contended that he continued to make deposits into the community estate following the couples separation the trial court as factfinder and judge of the credibility of witnesses could have determined that wife was more credible than husband   based on the evidence the trial court as the factfinder could reasonably have determined that husband was entitled to receive only an offset of  for the rental income used to benefit the community estate although husband was entitled to an offset of  the trial court was within its discretion in failing to allow husband a credit in this amount because husband received the benefit of the increased value to his home in an equal or greater value to the offset to which he was entitled   during the time of marriage husbands house increased in value between  and   the increased value to husbands house during the marriage was an asset that could have been included in the community assets subject to division by the trial court but was not   see eg murff  swd at  stating that trial court may consider many factors in deciding the estates of the parties including the size of their separate estates  padon v padon  swd   texappsan antonio  no writ holding that trial court may consider a spouses separate property when dividing the spouses estates  wilkinson v wilkinson no cv  wl  at  texappaustin may   no pet not designated for publication stating that trial court may consider enhancement in value of a spouses separate real property when determining reimbursements   because husbands house received an increased value in an equal or greater amount than  during the marriage the trial court acted within its discretion by declining to offset the reimbursement claim of after considering all the facts and circumstances the trial court could have determined that it was fair just and equitable to limit husbands offset to  from the rental income   the trial court could have further determined that because husbands house increased in value between  and  the rental income received from the lease of the house approximately equaled the increase in value to the house and thus husband was not entitled to any offset from the reimbursement claim   see penick  swd at  holding that trial court should consider facts and circumstances and determine what is just fair and equitablewe overrule husbands fourth point of erroreconomic contributionthe economic contribution award stems from a claim by the community estate to compensate it for the enhancement in value derived from community funds to the house that wife owned before the marriage   in conclusion of law number three the trial court assessed a value of  for the economic contribution to wifes house made by the community estate   the community estates entire economic contribution award valued at  was awarded to wife as her sole propertyin issue three husband makes two challenges to the economic contribution award   first husband asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by “failing to award husband onehalf of the communitys equitable contribution to wifes separate estate while taking that award into consideration in the calculation of the net award to each party and by intending an award close to  and favoring husband and effecting a  award favoring wife” second husband contends that the trial court undervalued the economic contribution awarddivision of economic contribution award in divorce decree a marital estate that makes an economic contribution to property owned by another marital estate has a claim for economic contribution against the benefited estate  tex famcode ann § a vernon supp   in a decree of divorce the court shall determine the rights of both spouses in a claim for economic contribution as provided by family code chapter  subchapter e in a manner that the court considers just and right having due regard for the rights of each party  tex famcode ann § a vernon supp   the court shall further order a division of a claim for economic contribution of the community marital estate to the separate marital estate of one of the spouses  tex famcode ann § a   a spouse seeking economic contribution must bring forth sufficient evidence for the factfinder to determine the enhancement value to the benefited estate  boyd v boyd  swd   texappfort worth  no pet husbands contention that he was due onehalf of the economic contribution award ignores the statutory requirement that the award must be divided in a “just and right” distribution  tex famcode ann § a   although husband is correct in stating that wife was awarded all of the economic contribution value from her separate estate we nonetheless conclude for two reasons that a just and right distribution of the assets occurred under the circumstances here   first as addressed above husband was awarded all of the communityestate reimbursement claims against his separate estate for a total of  an amount greater than the  granted to wife for the economic contribution award   the record suggests that rather than dividing the reimbursement claim and the economic contribution award between husband and wife the trial court assigned the respective awards which were similar in value to husband and wife respectively   second husband received a just and right division of the marital estate as discussed in issues one and two abovewe conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under the circumstances here which include the award of  all the economic contribution claim to wife  all the reimbursement claim to husband and  the division of the entire community estate in a just and right manneramount of economic contribution awardhusband also contends that the trial court abused its discretion by incorrectly assessing a value of  rather than  for the economic contribution claim   according to family code chapter  subchapter e the amount of the claim based on economic contribution is equal to the product of  the equity in the benefited property on the date of divorce  multiplied by  a fraction in which  a the numerator is the economic contribution to the property owned by the benefited marital estate by the contributing marital estate  and b the denominator is an amount equal to the sum of i  the economic contribution to the property owned by the benefited marital estate by the contributing marital estate  and ii  the contribution by the benefited estate to the equity in the property owned by the benefited estate  tex famcode ann § b vernon husband and wife recognize that the formula described in section b of the family code is axbcdbcdef   see id they likewise agree to all of the values in the formula with the exception of  the fair market value of wifes house on date of marriage and divorce and  the economic contribution in the form of improvements to wifes house   these disagreements result in the discrepancy between the assessed value of the economic contribution claim by husband and wife husband asserts that the economic contribution claim should be  as compared to the trial courts award of  based on wifes figures which the trial court adopted  fair market value of wifes houseit is undisputed that wife purchased her house in  and thus before the marriage for    the parties disagreement concerning the fair market value of wifes house at the time of marriage pertains to wifes contention that she made  in improvements to the house prior to marriage elevating its value to    wife testified that she spent  for the installation of marble tile and formal drapes in her house prior to marriage thereby enhancing the value of the house by similarly husband and wife also disagree about the fair market value of wifes house at the time of divorce   husband contends the houses value at that time was  but wife asserts that the value was    husbands asserted value comes from the assessed value of the house at  for taxation purposes by the harris county appraisal district hcad   husband acknowledged however that in his sworn inventory he claimed that the house was worth only  that he only had a “rough idea” of the fair market value of the house and that he did not know the fair market value of the house at the time of divorce   wife testified that she researched her neighborhood to determine the selling price of comparable homes and believed that her home only had a fair market value of about    she further stated that she was challenging hcads assessed value based on the record before us we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by determining that the fair market value of wifes house at the time of marriage was  and that its fair market value at the time of divorce was  as wife contended improvements to wifes house husband contends that  of community funds were spent on improvements that enhanced wifes house pursuant to the “c” portion of the family code formula but wife asserts that no community funds were spent during the marriage for improvements to her house   according to husband improvements to wifes house during the marriage consisted of door refinishing installing solar screens on windows and installing a lawn sprinkler system   although husband testified that  in community funds were spent on improvements to wifes house he also acknowledged that he did not know whether those funds were actually spent for improvements to wifes house   moreover husband acknowledged that he did not know which repairs constituted improvements for purposes of his claim for economic contribution   these circumstances warranted the trial courts impliedly determining that husband did not bring forth sufficient evidence from which the trial court as factfinder could determine the enhancement value to wifes benefited estate allegedly derived from community funds   see boyd  swd at    this determination in turn further warranted the trial courts determining that no community funds were spent on improvements to wifes house   we thus conclude that the trial court did not err by entering its conclusion of law number three by assessing a value of  as proposed by wife for the economic contribution made by the community estate on wifes housewe overrule husbands issue threecumulative errorin his fifth point of error husband complains that the trial court committed cumulative error requiring remand for new trial on the property division   having found no error in husbands issues one through four we conclude no cumulative error occurredwe overrule husbands fifth point of errorconclusionwe affirm the

innocent spouse would have derived from continuing the marriage and the probable need for future support   smith v smith  swd   texapphouston st dist  no writ   wifes equity in her house appears to be only    finding of fact number six shows that wifes house was valued at  on the date of marriage but finding of fact number e shows a principal debt of  on her house on the date of marriage   husbands equity appears to be approximately    finding of fact number seven shows that husbands house and lot were valued at    husbands testimony in the record reflects that he owed  in mortgage debt at the time of marriage   in finding of fact number six the trial court found that wife owned as her separate property prior to marriage  shares of stock in her employers stockownership plan account   the record shows that the stocks fluctuated in value but for the year ending october   the value of the stocks totaled    additionally finding of fact number six shows that wife owned a profitsharing plan with a value of  as her separate property prior to marriage   we have construed husbands broadly phrased issue as arguably encompassing in addition a challenge to the trial courts decision to require each party to pay the attorneys fees that each incurred during the divorce proceedings   accordingly we note that the debt for wifes attorneys fees was  according to the trial courts finding of fact number eight but that no findings of fact establish husbands attorneys fees   before the close of the evidence husband had established only that his attorneys fees amounted to    at the close of evidence however husbands attorney was permitted to testify over wifes objections that his attorneys fees were    as we explain further in this opinion we may infer missing findings in support of the trial courts rulings under the circumstances of this case   see texr civ p   vickery v commn for lawyer discipline  swd   texapphouston th dist  pet denied   given the trial courts implied finding that husband incurred  in attorneys fees and the discretion vested in the trial court to effect a just and right division we cannot say that the trial court exceeded its statutory discretion by requiring that husband and wife each be responsible for attorneys fees that each incurred during the divorce proceedings   we disagree with wife that it would have been proper for the trial court to decline an offset on this basis because the record reflects that husbands truck was a community asset acquired during the marriage   the truck was included as one of the community assets divided by the court   thus even if rental income was used to pay for the truck because the truck was community property the community estate benefited from the rental payments   see alsenz  swd at  noting that community property has been defined as “ ‘all property and pecuniary rights obtained by or in the name of either spouse after the marriage by toil talent thrift energy industry or other productive faculty and all the rents issues profits fruits and revenues of separate property’ ” quoting logan v logan  swd   texcivappamarillo  no writ   wifes testimony established that husbands house increased in value approximately  during the marriage when community assets were expended to benefit the house   she said that the fair market value of husbands house on the date of marriage was  and that the fair market value of husbands house at the time of divorce was    according to husband his house increased in value approximately  during the marriage   husband did not testify directly concerning the fair market value of his house but gave a general assessment that he believed that houses in his neighborhood were selling in the “low fifties” at the time of marriage and in the “sixties” at the time he divorced   husbands economic contribution claim came from the following figures atotal equity at date of divorcethe equity amount was based on the fair market value of the property on the date of

swd   lambert l hailey plaintiffappellant v albert h cunningham ann west cunningham john w shankle and james l winfree defendantsappellees supreme court of tennessee at nashville july    claude callicott james c mcbroom nashville for plaintiffappellant herbert r rich nashville philip m carden nashville of counsel for albert h cunningham and ann west cunningham thomas e watts jr nashville for john w shankle and james l winfree opinion harbison justice in this nonjury action the lessee of a commercial building sought reimbursement from two subsequent sets of assignees of the lease for the amount of judgment interest and attorneys fees which the lessee had been required to pay to the lessors the trial court allowed recovery and the assignees appealed they presented numerous issues all of which were overruled by the court of appeals with the exception of the question of mitigation of damages the court of appeals found insufficient evidence that the lessors had reasonably mitigated their damages after abandonment of the premises by a third assignee it accordingly disallowed all recovery and dismissed the action this court granted the lessees application for permission to appeal and the assignees asserted here the issues as to which they had been unsuccessful in the court of appeals we are of the opinion that the court of appeals correctly decided all of the issues raised here by the appellees these involved questions of laches estoppel failure of the lessee to implead the assignees in the action originally brought against him by the lessors lack of notice and the statute of frauds we find no merit in any of these issues and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and of the trial court with respect thereto as to the single issue on which the court of appeals reversed the judgment we are of the opinion that the evidence does not preponderate against the finding of the trial judge that the lessors had made sufficient reasonable efforts to mitigate damages accordingly the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed as to the issue of mitigation of damages and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated including judgment over by the first assignees against the second assignees the cause will be remanded to the trial court for any further proceedings which may be necessary  there is almost no dispute as to the material and controlling facts on august   appellant lambert l hailey leased from his brother robert v hailey and four of his sisters a commercial tract of land on eighth avenue south in nashville tennessee on which the lessors agreed to construct a new building comprising a liquor store and a drivein grocery store the lease was for a period of ten years to commence upon completion of the improvements the parties agree that the effective date of the lease was september   and it terminated on august   appellant lambert l hailey went into possession and operated a business on the premises for about six and onehalf years on february   he and his wife entered into a written agreement with albert h cunningham and wife ann west cunningham under which the haileys sold to the cunninghams the business which they were conducting together with the stockintrade and they also assigned the lease to the cunninghams the latter agreeing to assume all of its obligations and covenants including payment of  monthly rental the cunninghams held the property for only a few months on june   they sold the business and inventory together with their interest in the lease to john w shankle and james l winfree the second set of assignees the latter did not execute or affix their signatures to a formal assignment of the lease which was signed by the cunninghams but they did sign a written agreement specifying that they purchased the business and the lease they went into possession and conducted business there for more than one year on september   they executed a further assignment of the lease to one bobby l mason who assumed and agreed to discharge all its obligations appellant lambert l hailey the cunninghams and the second assignees shankle and winfree paid the specified rent and otherwise complied with the terms of the lease during the times when they were respectively in possession of the premises mason apparently paid the rent from late september  through march  a total of about six months the record shows that during this period of time he altered the premises considerably changed the improvements and conducted a different type of business from that which had been conducted by the previous tenants he defaulted in the rent for april  and at some point thereafter he vacated the premises this date is not clearly established in the record in early june  the lessors sued mason and appellant lambert l hailey the other assignees were not joined as parties that suit sought rent for the months of april may and june  which had then accrued in addition the complaint alleged that mason apparently still in occupancy had made considerable improvements to the personal property located on the leased premises and the lessors alleged that they feared that he was about to remove from the premises all of the fixtures located thereon the lessors therefore sought an injunction against him as well as judgment against him and lambert l hailey for the accrued rental together with attorneys fees and expenses in addition lessors sought a declaration that the lease be terminated pursuant to its provisions and that the lessors be entitled to rerent the property for the unexpired term at the expense of the lessee process was served upon hailey but not upon mason the summons as to him being returned as not to be found in the county his address was given as being the leased premises and another address in a different part of nashville was also written on the summons mason has not been heard from since and from the nature of the return which no party has attempted to impeach it must be assumed that he could not be located after diligent search and inquiry see tca §§   willshire v frees  tenn   swd   sb gilreath and br aderholt caruthers history of a lawsuit §§   th ed  from the nature of the return of the sheriff it may reasonably be assumed that  mason had vacated the premises by the time the return was made june   it does not appear however that the lessors had reentered or accepted a surrender of the lease at that time the allegations of the complaint seem to indicate otherwise hailey did not immediately answer the complaint and several motions for default judgment were filed these being set aside by agreement between counsel for the lessors and counsel for hailey ultimately however in october  default judgment was entered against hailey and the matter was set for a hearing on damages on february   on march   judgment was entered following this hearing formally terminating the lease authorizing the lessors to reenter and rent for the remaining six months of the term at the best rental available charging any deficiency against the lessee hailey and awarding judgment against hailey for the accrued rent of  eleven months from april  through february  together with counsel fees and expenses to the lessors no transcript of the february   hearing was preserved it does appear from testimony in the present case however that the lessors presented proof to the chancellor as to their efforts to rerent the premises during the interval after the filing of suit counsel for the lessors testified in the present case that he had his clients obtain for him copies of an advertisement which had been run by a realtor in november  together with a letter from the realtor stating that numerous advertisements had been made in august  apparently the chancellor was satisfied at that time and from the proof adduced before him that the lessors had made a good faith effort to rerent the premises although without success in the present case the lessor his attorney and the former counsel for appellant lambert l hailey testified that the lessors placed the property in the hands of another realtor dobson  johnson inc either shortly before or shortly after rendition of the final judgment against hailey on march   there was testimony that dobson  johnson placed a rental sign on the premises and advertised it on several occasions in a local newspaper the record shows that this realtor was unable to obtain another tenant during the remaining six months of the term but did do so after the term expired on august   there was no objection to any of this testimony except as to the letter from the real estate agent to one of the lessors in november  outlining the dates of several previous advertisements the trial court held that letter inadmissible apparently under the mistaken impression that it had not been addressed to a lessor but the purpose for which it was offered was to show what evidence had been presented to the chancellor at the previous hearing in the original default suit regardless of that the trial court in the present case found that the lessors had made a reasonable effort to rerent the premises and had used proper diligence to mitigate their damages appellant lambert l hailey paid in full the judgment rendered against him and brought the present action against the first and second sets of assignees for reimbursement or indemnification at the trial of the present case the assignees offered no evidence whatever to show that the original lessors had failed to use proper diligence in rerenting the property or mitigating their damages and no evidence that the counsel fees and other expenses awarded against hailey were unreasonable or improper they were accorded a full opportunity to offer evidence on any of these issues including the opportunity to crossexamine the original attorney for the lessors it is conceded by appellant that the assignees were not concluded by the judgment rendered in the original action and they were given every opportunity in the present case to develop any defense to the claim of the lessors which they might have had or which might have been asserted by the original lessee in the first suit there seems to be no question among the parties but that the various instruments by which the lease was transferred  were assignments not subleases thereby rendering each assignee directly liable to the lessors and not simply liable to the immediately preceding assignor see first american national bank v chicken system of america inc  swd  tenn  ernst v conditt  tenn app   swd   each assignor in effect became a surety for each of the assignees and under the terms of the various assignments each assignor continued to be liable for the rent and other covenants of the lease there is no claim of novation or that any of the parties was released by the terms of any of the instruments executed it appears from the evidence that the question of the mitigation of damages by the lessors through their attempts to rerent the property was considered by the chancellor in the trial of the original action and it was also fully considered by the trial judge in the present case at which time each of the defending sets of assignees was given a full opportunity to develop that or any other defense which might conceivably have been raised to the original claim of the landlords in which judgment was rendered against the lessee and for which he here seeks reimbursement in its opinion the court of appeals held that the burden of proof rests upon a plaintiff or claimant to prove the exercise of due care in efforts to mitigate his damages for this proposition it cited karns v vester motor co  tenn   swd   we do not so interpret the case it is true that the court concluded its opinion with a statement that the injured party to a contract has a duty to do everything possible to minimize his damages  tenn at   swd at  the court was not however discussing the question of producing evidence or the burden of proof those were not issues in the case among the cases cited in that opinion was plesofsky v kaufman  flonacker  tenn   sw   that was not a landlordtenant case but in it the court stated the general rule that a party guilty of a breach of contract has the burden of proving that the damages alleged could have been prevented or mitigated by action of the claimant  tenn at   sw at  this is indeed the general rule applicable to actions for damages in this state in the case of international correspondence school inc v crabtree  tenn    swd    the court said with respect to the burden of proof in such cases the general rule is that the defendant has the onus of establishing matters asserted by him in mitigation or reduction of the amount of plaintiffs damages see also dale v thomas h temple co  tenn    swd    edenfield v woodlawn manor inc  tenn app   swd   southern fire  casualty co v norris  tenn app   swd   price v osborne  tenn app   swd   it is our opinion that in the original action between the lessors and the lessee the latter had the burden of proof to establish failure of the lessors to mitigate their damages that same affirmative defense would have been available to the present appellees had they been joined in that action since they were not so joined they had the opportunity of adducing evidence in the present case that the lessors had not sufficiently mitigated damages and they offered none nor have they shown how the present appellant the original lessee could have done more than was done in the original action to show lack of diligence by the lessors in fact the present record indicates that the lessors did engage two different commercial real estate firms to attempt to rerent the property had it advertised in newspapers on several occasions and had a rental sign placed thereon there is no suggestion of anything else that the lessors could reasonably have been expected to do the court of appeals stated that some of the evidence offered by the lessee in the present case particularly through his former attorney was hearsay even if this be true there was no objection made to it nor was there any motion to strike it certainly  cannot be said to lack probative value having been received in evidence as it was and not being controverted or countered by any other evidence offered by the appellees we are satisfied that the evidence does not preponderate against the conclusions of the trial judge there has been no showing of any prejudice to any of the appellees by reason of any delay involved in the filing of the present suit nor any reason why appellant should be repelled in the present case for failure to join the appellees as thirdparties in the original action the defense of the statute of frauds offered by the second set of assignees is entirely without substance see sander v piggly wiggly stores inc  tenn app   swd   the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and that of the trial court is reinstated in all respects costs incident to the appeal will be taxed onehalf to the cunninghams and onehalf to shankle and winfree all other costs will remain as fixed by the trial court the cause is remanded to that court for any further proceedings which may be appropriate fones cj brock and drowota jj and humphreys special justice
