you may begin richard j giromini thank you vivian and good morning welcome to the wabash national corporation  second quarter earnings call this is dick giromini president and chief executive officer joining me today is jeff taylor senior vice president and chief financial officer following this introduction i will provide highlights for the second quarter followed by a look at the current operating environment and our outlook for the remainder of the year after which jeff will provide an overview of our financial results at the conclusion of our prepared remarks we’ll open the call for questions from the listening audience before we begin i would like to cover two items first as with all of these types of presentations this morning’s call contains certain forwardlooking information including statements about the company’s prospects the industry outlook backlog information financial condition and other matters as you know actual results could differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements these statements should be viewed in light of the cautionary statements and risk factors set forth from timetotime in the company’s filings with the securities and exchange commission second please note that this call is being recorded i’ll begin by saying that we’re pleased with the company’s overall performance this quarter and the ongoing financial and operating improvements we’re experiencing in most areas of the business particularly the commercial trailer products segment our solid second quarter results are further evidence of our ability to consistently deliver on our commitment to continually improve our overall performance and to grow the business through broader array of products end markets and geographies but we look forward to even better days ahead as the actions that we have put in place to address some previously reported temporary headwinds related to lumber pricing are now taking hold and will benefit us as we proceed through the balance of the year additionally continued strong demand is providing a favorable environment in support of stronger pricing for our truckload product offerings as we enter the  quoting season we continue to gain considerable momentum as we execute our broadbased strategic plan and further transform wabash national into a diversified industrial manufacture with higher growth and margin profile in the second quarter we achieved alltime record revenue in operating income for the company as we benefited from historically strong shipment and exceptional performance in our commercial trailer products group trailer shipments across the business for the quarter were approximately  units exceeding our previous guidance of  to  units as customers pickup accelerated and gained considerable momentum throughout the quarter second quarter build levels totaled approximately  units up some  units over the prior quarter in consistent with our earlier projects net sales for the quarter were an alltime record  million representing a  million or  increase compared to second quarter of  in addition adjusted earnings for the quarter increased more than  million or  yearoveryear to  million operating ebitda which we believe is an important metric to highlight the companys progress increased by  or  million to a bestever  million in the second quarter operating income for the second quarter was  million representing a  million or  increase yearoveryear while gross margin in the quarter did show a deterioration of  basis points and yearoveryear comparison to  the improvement in operating income was driven by the significant improvement in commercial trailer products and partially offset by the decline in diversified products while the yearoveryear change in gross margin was largely attributable to the segment mix shift between commercial trailer products and diversified products with ctp representing  of total company revenue in the current quarter as compared to  in the prior year quarter i’ll provide more color around segment performance in a moment overall we had a solid second quarter with strong trailer shipments builds and revenue which translated into strong profitability and operating ebitda we achieved new quarterly records for operating performance as evidenced by our revenue operating income and operating ebitda results during the second quarter quote and order activity remained strong throughout the quarter and in contrast typical seasonal expectations for the second quarter our backlog increased during the quarter to  million the highest levels since  consistent with the strong industry wide trailer net order levels being reported by act research with six months of reporting now in industry wide trailer and net orders totaled  units versus  units through the same period last year this certainly supports our longstanding belief that this could turn out to be a protracted cycle of strong demand for our industry driven by excessively age fleets the demanding regulatory environment and an improved pricing environment for our customers leading to improved profitability in investment in new equipment lookingforward we see a continuance of a strong and solid demand environment supporting pricing stability and opportunity for continued growth in the core trailer business and as you will hear in a moment the sentiment is supported by strengthening forecast from those act and ftr with that let’s shift focus to some highlights from each of our reporting segments and jeff will follow with additional details regarding financial performance we’ll start with the commercial trailer product segment consisting of our dry and refrigerated van products platforms trailers and fleet trade used trailer sales this segment continues to perform well in executing its optimization strategy setting records across a number of financial and performance metrics in the quarter net sales for this segment increased  million or  on shipment of  trailer or  more trailers than the prior year period this increasing revenue was primarily due to a nearly  increase in trailer shipments during the quarter partially offset by our products and sales channel mix shift impacting asps by over  including a higher incidence of customer supply tires impacting van trailer asps by  during the quarter versus the yearago period both causing nice gains made in pricing and spec mix of  per unit to loose visibility in the numbers net sales of  million for the quarter is the highest ever reported for this segment has now constituted on the margin side of the equation the business is performing well and gaining momentum as the group generated gross margins of  a  basis points improvement over the same period last year representing the highest gross margin ever reported for this segment is now constituted and based on the current backlog and build schedule we would expect the gross margin to improve further in the third quarter consistent with normal seasonality and continued performance improvement as we’ve discussed in the past several quarters the ctp team remains focused on the goal of achieving a doubledigit gross margin quarter by the end of next year with a longer term goal of sustaining that level on an ongoing basis as reflected in our results we continue to make consistent progress toward achieving these goals driven by our stated initiatives of margin growth through selective order intake pricing manufacturing productivity optimization and supply chain cost initiatives we expect trailer demands remain strong throughout  with both industry forecasters expecting total demand significantly above both replacement levels and last years demand in fact the trailer outlook both internally and externally remain strong with our increase to the fullyear trailer guidance in addition to act and ftr respectively raising the trailer shipment and trailer production forecast for  obviously we’re very pleased with the current performance in this segment and look forward to continued progress moving on to the diversified products segment which includes the walker group wabash composites and wabash wood products this story is a little different following eight quarters of exceptional performance dpg segment took a temporary step back as it face the combined impact at of the continued headwinds related lumber pricing along with unanticipated startup cost challenges for a new product introduction within the wabash composites business although challenge this segment still generated net sale of  million consistent with the prior year period while gross margin for the segment declined by  basis point compared to the prior period to  driven notably by the higher wood material cost of  million along with new product startup cost within wabash composites of approximately  million related to the introduction and ramp up of the new truck box absent just these two temporary cost issues gross margins for dpg in the second quarter would implied more normalized  and  on a consolidated basis for the company on the revenue side some less favorable tank trailer mix and shipment delays related to nontrailer truck mounted equipment and other engineered products impacted topline growth yearoveryear that too should correct itself as we proceed through the balance of the year similar to the actions we put in place in  to address significant higher cost inflation faced at that time we currently have a active lumber cost recovery initiative underway along with lumber cost increased protection language now incorporated in all our new growths while these actions were put in place midway during this past quarter the effect of these actions will begin to be realized during the current third quarter and our expected to put this particular headwind issue fully behind us well before yearend our wabash composites business delivered somewhat mix performance a strong aeroskirt truck body demand led to best ever quarterly revenue counter by a less favorable product mix is compared to last year and the aforementioned truck box startup costs all combined negatively impacting operating results by nearly  yearoveryear on the new product growth front as referenced to wabash composites team begin manufacturing new duraplate based mobile truck box for a large ltl carrier providing improved efficiency for loading and unloading of goods with the launch cost challenges now behind us we see excellent growth potential for this product as it means the significantly enhanced efficiency productivity and velocity for ltl carriers in addition to finding new applications in mobile transportation of storage the team continues its work and developing new aerodynamic solutions to support increasing demand for improve fuel efficiency as aftermarket demand for duraplate aeroskirt sales continues to grow and with five new products plan for launch during the balance of the year we look forward to continued top and bottom line growth for this business for the foreseeable future finally our retail segment experiences a strong quarter with yearoveryear improvement in revenue and profitability net sales of approximately  million represent a  million increase yearoveryear primarily due to higher new and used trailer sales assisted by higher parts and service revenue gross margin dollars rose in the quarter to a strong  million our gross margin present were slightly lower to  as the increase in sales was offset by higher costs to support our strategic growth initiatives for this business as we announced in may regarding the addition of tec equipment incorporated as a new independent dealer to support the west coast region our retail segment transitioned operation of three wabash international trailer centers to tec in an effort to aid our core ctp business and further expanding sales and service support in the region given tecs extensive footprint in industry connections although this had minimal of impact on our overall business during the quarter we expect this relationship will pay dividends through higher sales of new trailers for ctp business and the pull through of aftermarket parts in the region obviously this move will result and lower revenue for the retail segment going forward but with even greater positive impact ctp revenue and profits longer term as unit sales from this expanded coverage region are expected to more than double that said we remain focused on executing our retail strategy to profitably grow this segment by increasing our presence in the tank repair and services business through expansion of the number of legacy wntc locations with the capability to perform this service expanding our mobile fleet and increasing the number of customer site service locations that we operate in that regard we are pleased to announce we’ve entered into agreements to operate five additional customer site service locations bringing the total now eight locations at which we provide the service down the road more to come before i discuss wabash financials specific expectations for the third quarter and fullyear of  let me comment on few key economic indicators and industry dynamics we monitor closely to provide broader context for our expectations following the slowdown of economic activity in the first quarter of the year due to severe weather macro economic indicators improved in the second quarter manufacturing activity industrial production retail sales in the labor market of all seeing solid growth in recent months yeah more improvement opportunity existing housing sector of the economy were the recovery base installed at the end of last year most analyst now anticipate return to expansion for the years to come in during this next six months with both residential and nonresidential construction activity anticipated to contributed growth and as released just this morning gdp growth of  was reported for the second quarter consistent with just reported gdp strength key indicators and forecast within the trucking industry reflect growing confidence and demand strength and longevity atas trucktonnage index decline  in june to  following a  increase in may the index was  higher in june then in the same month last year and as increased  yeartodate versus the same period last year catching up to or not even exceeding our own early year internal projections of  to  yearoveryear demand growth the latest report form act research now forecast  trailer shipments at just over  up  yearoveryear and just under  trailers in  up another  sequentially with the continued belief by act that potential legislation to permit foot doubles is gaining support and would be included in a new transportation bill anticipated to be signed into law in mid which would drive even stronger demand in the  through  timeframe ftr is also adjusted its projections upward now forecasting  trailers to be produced for  an increase  yearoveryear and projecting  units to be produced in  according to ftr the class  active truck utilization rate was at  during the first half of the year equaling the historic high from  with expectations at active truck utilization will average  in  and  of  resulting in a very tight market supporting strong rate increases for carriers from a regulatory standpoint senator susan collins recently introduced a provision to the transportation appropriations bill to night funding to the hours of service restart roles the amendment with suspend the night rest requirement and the once weak limitation on the restart until september   or when the fmcsa completes new hours of service impact study call for in the amendment in the meantime carriers continued to report productivity losses as a result of the hours of service rule as we stated in previously calls these productivity losses combined with compliance challenges related to csa eld’s and car mainly to increase demand for additional drivers and equipment to fill the gap that said continuing growing driver shortage or car changes and driver compensation as recently alluded to by numerous trucking fleets so the combination of a slowly strengthening economy solid trucktonnage and improving rate environment an increasing regulatory impact of fleet productivity all support to potential for increase trailer demand overall higher industry with that let me share wabash national’s expectations for the fullyear  in the third quarter we believe overall demand for trailers we’re remain solid and significantly above replacement levels in  and beyond consistent with act and ftr projections as key drivers all remain positive fleet age customer profitability used trailer values regulatory compliance and access to finance all supported continued strong longerterm demand environment historically second quarter performance is typically a good indicator for the remainder of the year in our core trailer business total shipments of nearly  units exceed our previous guidance and based on the strength of build levels during the quarter along with backlog growth we are clearly well positioned as we progress through the second half of the year as a result we now expect third quarter consolidated shipments to be between  and  units as stated quote and order activity remain strong during the second quarter consistent with our growing backlog additionally with the recent stronger demand projections form both act and ftr for the current year along with our backlog fill for the year we are extremely comfortable with our internal projections that fullyear industry shipments will exceed those experienced in  while still remaining committed to favor margin growth over volume we’re confident now raising our expectations for fullyear shipments to be between  and  units in summary we are obviously pleased to have delivered a solid quarter overcoming some temporary headwinds within our diversified products business segment and continue our momentum from our record setting year in  some new records were accomplished but as always much opportunity remains we’re making progress but still need to make further progress in leveling out the current seasonality in numerous parts of our business the cost concern for external stake holders and operational and efficiency for those within those efforts continue we need to continue the progress we made thus far to further improve gross margins in our commercial trailer products business and find more attractive higher margin growth opportunities to drive its topline those efforts continue and are beginning to bear fruit we need to accelerate the topline growth of our diversified products business to leverage the attractive margins inherent within its offerings again well underway with new product offerings new markets now we need to improve our launch execution of those new offerings and we need to leverage the higher margin tank parts and remote service opportunities for growth of our retail segment same here underway has exhibited by the expansion of customer site service locations so a much as been done plenty of work remains we are now a much more diversified as a business and far different form the lavish of old ph leaving historical comparisons with little meaning we will continue to look at opportunities to strategically but selectively grow and diversify our business in addition to the organic growth initiatives already underway while continuing to be responsible stewards of the business to assure that the proper balance between risk and reward is considers in all decisions and we’ll continue to manage for the long term to build value and sustainability in closing we are extremely well positioned at this point delivering another year of top and bottomline growth with a solid backlog and demand environments continue to gain moment and the number of new products nearing launch stage with that i will turn the call over to jeffery taylor chief financial officer to provide more detail around the numbers jeff jeffery l taylor thanks dick and good morning in addition to the press release we filed the q after the market closed yesterday so i plan to hit the highlights with that let’s get started as dick mentioned consolidated revenue for the quarter is  million an increase of  million or   compared to the second quarter of last year and a the best ever quarterly revenue for the company total new trailer shipments were  units  units above the top end of our guidance range for the quarter and  units higher yearoveryear sequentially consolidated revenue increased  million or approximately  primarily due to an increase in new trailer shipments of  units driven by our core trailer business commercial trailer products’ net sales were  million which represents a  million or  increase on a yearoveryear basis due to higher new trailer shipments of approximately  units yearoveryear average new trailer selling prices decreased approximately  per unit to  primarily due to two factors first we are experiencing higher incidence of customer supplied components in particular to tires this year especially with the larger fleets which accounts for approximately twothirds of the change second the customer mix continues to skewed towards the large fleet customers with lower spec and lower price trailer as we discussed in prior quarters sequentially revenue increased  million or  on new trailer shipments of  units up  average selling price was flat sequentially as the customer mix remain stable with around  direct channel and  indirect channel diversified products net sales for flat yearoveryear at  million walker group revenue was lower primarily due to the timing of shipment of nontrailer truck mounted equipment and customer acceptance for other engineered products new trailer shipments increased by approximately  units compared to the prior year reflecting continued strong demand for liquid tank trailers wabash composites revenue was up slightly yearoveryear as a result of continued strong truck body demand and demand for duraplate aeroskirt with the conway aeroskrit retrofit program being a strong contributed in the quarter wabash wood products revenue was up  over the prior year period as a result of increased wood requirements reflecting the higher demand for new trailer in commercial trailer product on the sequential basis diversified products net sale increased  million or  primarily due to the increased second quarter demand for composite products and wood products consisted with expected seasonal patterns revenue from the retail segment increased more than  million or  compared to the same period last year on higher sales of new trailers by approximately  units as well as higher used trailer sales and continued strong demand for parts and service while the tec agreement had minimal impact over retail results in the current quarter it will impact future results with the three retail locations being transitioned to tec or independent dealer on the west coast these three locations sold approximately  new trailers in  and we expect to double this amount in the current year with tec however the new trailer sales will be credited to commercial trailer products going forward additionally these branch locations accounted for approximately  million of parts  service revenue in  sequentially net sales from retail increased approximately  million or  driven primarily by higher new and used trailer shipments in the current quarter consistent with normal seasonality looking at our various product lines new trailer sales of  million on  units increased  million or  yearoveryear including approximately  liquid tank trailers in our diversified product segment this yearoveryear increase is due to strong demand for new trailers across all business segments used trailer revenue was approximately  million on  units an increase of approximately  million from the prior quarter as a result of increased fleet trades within commercial trailer products as you know fleet trades tend to be seasonal and are generally front end loaded in the first half of the year component parts and service revenue was approximately  million in the quarter essentially flat from a year ago with strong demand for composite products as well as parts  service through our retail locations offset by a decline in commercial trailer products nontrailer transportation equipment sales finally equipment and other revenue on a yearoveryear basis decreased by  million to  million for the quarter this decrease was primarily driven by lower sales from the nontrailer truck mounted equipment within diversified products in terms of operating results consolidated gross profit for the quarter was  million or  of sales compared to  million in the same period last year this represents a  million or  improvement yearoveryear commercial trailer products was the largest contributor to the gross profit increase with retail also making a positive contribution diversified products gross profit decreased primarily due to the temporary or onetime headwinds faced during the quarter which dick mentioned and i will address momentarily with that let’s look at the segments in more detail commercial trailer products’ gross margin improved  basis points over last year resulting in a  increase in gross profit or  million sequentially gross profit increased  million or  on seasonally higher trailer volume while gross margin improved  basis points production during the quarter was  units up by approximately  units sequentially as production ramped up from the first quarter consistent with seasonal expectations and reflecting the strong industry demand on a yearoveryear basis production was up  units due to strong demand diversified product gross profits decreased  million and gross margin declined  basis points compared to the prior year period due to multiple headwinds experienced in the quarter wabash wood products declined  million yearoveryear and the largest factor was the higher lumber cost as the base price of lumber increased  since the second quarter of last year the good news is that lumber prices have been stable for the past weeks albeit at historically elevated levels and as dick mentioned earlier we have implemented cost recovery and new order cost protection actions additionally as dick mentioned after adjusting for the wood price impact and the composite new product startup cost diversified products gross margin would be  the wabash composites business group gross profit decreased yearoveryear due to startup cost of approximately  million for a new mobile freight container walker group profit declined in the period due to lower net sales for nontrailer products and changes in customer and product mix resulting in lower average selling prices the liquid tank trailers lastly the retail segments gross profit in the quarter increased  million or  yearoveryear due to increased new and used trailer sales as well as continued strength in parts of services on the total company basis adjusting for the wood impact and composite new product startup cost consolidated gross margin would have been  the company generated operating income of  million in the quarter and increased of  million or  yearoveryear with solid attribution from all three operating segments and  of sales operating margin was approximately excuse me  basis points lower than the prior year quarter sequentially operating income was higher by  million primarily driven by higher shipments of new trailers in the commercial trailer product segment due to normal seasonality and reflecting the strong demand environment in the core trailer business operating ebitda for the second quarter was  million a yearoveryear increase of  million or  resulting from the strong second quarter performance from commercial trailer products and solid contributions from diversified products and retail sequentially operating ebitda increased by  million on stronger seasonal second quarter demand on a trailing  month basis total company revenue now exceeds  billion with operating ebitda of approximately  million or  of revenue selling general and administrative excluding amortization for the quarter was  million a decrease of  million or  over the second quarter of last year this yearoveryear decrease is primarily related to lower professional service and bad debt expense partially offset by higher employee relating costs sequentially sga expense for the quarter increased by  million and higher employee related costs however sga expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to  of sales on higher net sales in the current quarter we expect sga as a percentage of revenue to be approximately  or lower for the fullyear intangible amortization for the quarter was  million essentially flat with the prior quarter and the prior year period the intangible amortization in the current quarter is consistent with the guidance previously provided and is expected to continue at this level for the remainder of  interest expense consist primarily of borrowing cost totaling approximately  million a yearoveryear decrease of  million primarily related to the repricing of the term loan in may of and  million of voluntary term loan prepayments we made in  lastly approximately  million of reported interest expenses noncash and primarily relates to the attrition charges associated with the convertible notes in regards to managing our capital structure and debt we made another  million voluntary debt prepayment on the term loan in late june brining our total voluntary prepayments up to  million since the second quarter of  the annualized impact of the cumulative voluntary prepayments to the term loan is  million per year of reduced interest cost lastly the outstanding balance on the term loan was  million as of june  we’ve recognized income tax expense of  million in the second quarter the effective tax rate for the quarter was  however we continue to expect the fullyear effective tax rate to be approximately  to  at june  we have effectively utilized all of the us federal income tax net operating loss carry forwards which were available at the beginning of this year as a result the company expects to become a cash tax payer of us federal income taxes in the second half of  finally for the quarter net income was  million or  per diluted share on a gaap basis on a nongaap adjusted basis after adjusting for expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt and transitions in our west coast branch locations to independent dealer facilities net income was  million or  per diluted shares in comparison the nongaap adjusted earnings for the second quarter  were  million or  per diluted share which exclude nonrecurring charges related to the early extinguishment of debt and acquisition expenses related to the walker acquisition and the purchase of deal assets with that let’s move to the balance sheet and liquidity networking capital increased during the current quarter by approximately  million resulting from increased production and higher sales compared to the prior quarter we expect networking capital to be relatively stable during the third quarter however it is possible that networking capital increases slightly due to higher trailer builds higher trailer shipments and increased revenue capital spending was approximately  million for the quarter and  million yeartodate at this stage we anticipate fullyear  capital spending to be approximately  million consistent with our previous guidance our liquidity our cash plus available borrowing as of june  was approximately  million an increase of  million from the end of the prior quarter inclusive of the  million debt prepayment that have previously discussed cash on the balance sheet was the driver of increased liquidity is the asset based revolver remains on that the pro forma total and net debt leverage were  times and  times respectively you may recall from our investor day presentation in may of  to one of our longterm financial objectives was the lower our net leverage ratio below two times and we accomplish this goal in the second quarter in addition our senior secured leverage ratio under the term loan credit agreement was  times significantly below the current government requirement of  times or less with that let me wrap up with some overall financial highlights the company performed very well during the quarter despite the significant but temporary headwinds impacting the diversified products group we are pleased with the financial results and particular the record levels of revenue operating income and operating ebitda however we see the potential for further improvement the balance sheet remains strong with a solid cash balance and strong liquidity our leverage ratios and debt covenants remain in comfortable territory the business is generating strong cash from operations and operating ebitda looking forward we are well positioned going into the third quarter with a very solid backlog of  million and more experience in capable workforce which is reflected in the operational improvements across the company and trailer industry forecast from both act and ftr with suggest the current strength in the trailer market it sustainable not only in the nearterm but also into the foreseeable future lastly we are very pleased with standard reports recently upgraded our corporate credit rating one notch from b to bb siding improved profits and cash flow with a stable outlook thank you and i’ll now turn the call back to the operator and we will take any questions that’s you have questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instruction and our first question comes form brad delco brad please go ahead a brad delco – stephens inc good morning dick good morning jeff richard j giromini good morning brad jeffery l taylor good morning a brad delco – stephens inc dick you made some comments about the wood products division and the margin pressure you saw and the color on what steps are being taken to address that it sounds like we will some corrective actions in the third quarter and hope to fully recover by fourth quarter with  million of i guess yearoveryear head wins this quarter can you give us some more quantification as to what we might see in the third quarter and then maybe fourth quarter in terms of how this phases out or how quickly this phases out richard j giromini yes it moves over during the third quarter it get progressively better as we progress through the quarter so you look at the  million by the time we get to the fourth quarter that’s behind us but in the third quarter probably something less than a  million of impact as we progress through yes i think back to the timeframe in which we put the actions in places and that was about midway through the past quarter and when you look at the backlog that we already had in place so the actions to get all of the initiatives in place the recovery actions in place so we are starting to see the impact but it slowly builds up as we progress through the quarter so i would suggest something less than a  million of favorable impact relative to the position we are in the second quarter for the third quarter and then full recover in the fourth quarter a brad delco – stephens inc got it so when we think about sort of your – not in the silly guidance but the parameters you sort of set for gross margin expectations for diversified products segment being in that sort of  to  range isn’t out of the norm but maybe we see a little bit of pressure continue in the third quarter i mean can you be in that range third quarter or is it going to be something closer to what we saw richard j giromini yes it should improve somewhat but i will be lowend of the range that we provided in the past and then be more normalized as we get into that fourth quarter as the example i gave earlier about the  if we fully address the two elements the limber costs issue and the startup costs issue going away it’s a more normalized  so in that  to  range that we’ve kind of spelled before so yes it’s going to be pressure but on the lower end in the third quarter for certain jeffery l taylor right the other facts that will come into play there brad the seasonality of wabash composites is slightly different than the core trailer business and for the past couple of years their strongest quarter has been q and then they typically pull back a little in q so that’s the normal seasonal pattern that we see for wabash composites as well which could play a role in the third quarter results a brad delco – stephens inc gotcha and then maybe final question dick in your comments you also said you expect gross margin to improve in the third quarter are you specifically calling out gross margin dollars or how do we think about the seasonality of gross profit margin percent from second to third quarter and what could be affecting that richard j giromini yes brad i think obviously commercial trailer products is twothirds of the company on topline revenue so that’s going to be a big driver and the shipment guidance that we gave there we have a healthily backlog and so given the strong builds the strong shipment which weve discussed many times in regard to that seasonal pattern q is typically our strongest quarter there and so that will be a big driving factor and then we expect diversified products to improved sequentially as well as we just discussed in retail to perform also a brad delco – stephens inc got you so looking specifically though at commercial trailer products and not taking the mix between the segments if i look back historically you typically improved your gross profit margins in that trailer business by about  bips what could effect that one way or the other it seems like you guys are running close to  utilization pricing should be a little bit more pronounced and maybe those margins could be better what could work against you in terms of that normal sequential change jeffery l taylor it should improve second quarter to third quarter a brad delco – stephens inc okay all right guys thanks for the time i’ll get back in queue richard j giromini thank you brad operator and our next question comes from joel oday ph joel please go ahead unidentified analyst hi good morning guys first question i guess just looking at the implied shipments into the back half of the year it looks like right now you are calling for a little bit of a sequential step down from q to q that would be larger than what we’ve seen over the past few years and so is that just a matter of waiting for a little bit more backlog support in those numbers or just looking for a little bit more details on that implied guide richard j giromini yes joe i think weve consistently said we typically would expect q to be slightly stronger than q just as a normal seasonal pattern and our guidance for q is  to  i think if you do the math that you will see that q is slightly below that but it will depend upon customer pickups during q and q we are predicting a really nice healthy strong second half of the year and i think that’s real important message from the guidance we have given unidentified analyst okay and then maybe just a little bit bigger picture when you talk about a double digit margin in ctp you think about that kind of volumes you will have in the back half i mean those are very supportive volume so for that kind of target i mean is that on types of volumes that we’ll be seeing in the back half and could you just talk about kind of the operational steps that you have planned to then drive toward that double digit margin target jeffery l taylor yes obviously the strong market is certainly supporting those efforts so higher volume obviously brings the potential to get some leverage on it but the action is that the team has been very focused on being – favoring the margin improvement over volume so in other words not going after orders just for the second getting orders or trying to get the best of what’s available out there in this environment you get a lot of large orders from key customers because there are very healthy and they are replacing some very aged equipment and that’s where our comments earlier about the mix being in that i believe was  or  to  some ratio like that in the large direct versus the indirect segment so it’s still skewed heavily toward that group i think it’s like  to  and the second element of course is that ability to push the pricing through the market and we had worth of backlog at the end of the first quarter so if you think about what the remaining opportunities for quoting as we completed through the second quarter and now in the third quarter while pricing is continuing to be pushed the impact is less impactful than what it will be for the  calendar year and which we’re just entering that quoting season so we continue to push as all new quotes come in we are trying to take advantage of the stronger demand environment to continue to push pricing and ultimately improve those margin the other factors that come in the normal actions that we take under all conditions and that’s continuing to drive operational improvements on the factory floor through our continuous improvement efforts improving the proficiencies of the workforce the capabilities running lean events to optimize line velocity and inefficiencies on the factory floor and then the initiatives we take in our supply chain side on our supply components and materials pricing initiatives with suppliers as we enter into new agreements from yeartoyear so all of those factors play into getting to that doubledigit margin and hopefully beyond once we get there for a quarter then we get that to be sustainable for fullyear and then continue to look at ways to further enhance it through different product offerings and different end markets that we can get into unidentified analyst got it thanks very much jeffery l taylor you are welcome thank you operator and our next question comes from alex potter alex please go ahead alexander e potter – piper jaffray  co thanks hi guys richard j giromini hi alex alexander e potter – piper jaffray  co i was wondering if we could touch again on diversified products obviously there is the new products startup costs and there is the wood and all of this but it sounds like also there was some mix impacts i notice the asps on new trailers came down quiet a bit in that segments and you called mix out as well i was just wondering if you could flush that out a little bit more what was going on there specifically kind of in laymans terms and then do you expect that to correct or is that something that’s going to persist richard j giromini yes alex the mix that impacted in the diversified products let me start with the walker group and i think that’s probably the biggest area of impact there those liquid tank trailers there is a lot of variation in that space and the average price of liquid tank trailers in a fairly normal range is somewhere between  and  for each unit and certainly you know very unique units can be even significantly higher than in that high end but with that wider range for that the normal product variation and then you are going to see some variation in asp and we saw that in the second quarter where we had some other issue units that were on the lower end of the range there and that what contributed some to the product mix in addition you notice that the unit volume was up a  units quarteroverquarter from the prior year and we did have some larger order size that shift and obviously those the bigger orders put some pressure on pricing as well and that also impacted the quarter that’s what’s we’ve been described as customer mix jeffery l taylor how is it proceed going forward and we look at the average selling price that we have right now is kind of within the normal range so we would expect to see the normal variation continue there it could go up or it could go down alexander e potter – piper jaffray  co okay interesting thank you i was wondering also if we talk about within that liquid tank business obviously its fracking holding liquids holding water into an out of the those oil and gas fields is kind of a secular trend into the expanse that your mix in walker shifts more to move towards that segment generally speaking with that be a positive or negative or a neutral for emergence richard j giromini i think the – you’re talking about the energy in oil and gas and a couple of years ago that market was really hard and the margins were pretty inflated i think based on what we see in the current environment of those margins are within the normal range of what we see in the liquid tank trailer space so alexander e potter – piper jaffray  co okay very good thanks guys richard j giromini you’re welcome thank you operator and our next question comes form steve dyer steve please go ahead steven l dyer – craighallum capital group llc good morning dick good morning jeff richard j giromini hi steve jeffery l taylor hello steven l dyer – craighallum capital group llc so most of might have been answer so i want to make sure kind of – i’m thinking about the mass correct so it sounds like mix sort of what it has been in terms of ctp versus dpg and it sounds like kind of gross margins in the trailer business kind of remaining where they are maybe a little bit of improvement as we go here and then a little bit of improvement in q and more in q for dpg margin so i mean safe to assume that the gross margin in aggregate improves in q jeffery l taylor yeah i think your assessment in terms of the individual segments found it pretty accurate from what we talked about the only factor that comes into play there is the segment mix where dpg not dpg but ctp can grow proportionately to the rest of the company and represent a higher percentage of the total revenue and dick mentioned that in his comments for this quarter to the extent that you have a little bit of that movement in q than we don’t have to do the math and work that out for segment mix but i think your analysis of the individual segments mix sounds consistent with what we said steven l dyer – craighallum capital group llc so given that were i guess a month through that quarter and you kind of know what you have in the backlog would you expect the trailer mix that the ctp mix to grow proportionate or grow in excess of the rest in q or do you expect kind of that    of level jeffery l taylor in terms of channel mix i think the backlog richard j giromini destocking them mix between segments jeffery l taylor mix between the segments yeah the driving factor there is going to be the shipment guidance that we gave steve so we said  to  units in q we did  in q so it will be up slightly for ctp but once again you just need to do the math steven l dyer – craighallum capital group llc well but you didn’t give release but i heard dpg guidance directionally by for any so to specifics for q over q so lets i am trying to get the sense of kind of what’s you see more growth from an ultimately what the mix is in q jeffery l taylor yeah i think we expect dpg to perform fairly consistent with kind of historical patterns there steven l dyer – craighallum capital group llc okay thank you richard j giromini you are welcome thank you operator and our next question comes from john mims john please go ahead john r mims  fbr capital markets  co hey good morning guys thanks richard j giromini hi john john r mims – fbr capital markets  co and dick let me there has been a lot of numbers kind of turnaround so i just want to make sure i understand what you are saying that margins in the progression in third quarter in the dpg group so you said would pressure at the low end of the range if  to  but then you typically would see some seasonal softness from q to q so and if what you know now and realize it still somewhat fluid but is pressured mean you below that typical range or just at the low end so i am make sure understand what’s you are saying right jeffery l taylor yes so i think what dick was saying was that considering all of factors that are impacting us in the current quarter in the comments we made relative to the q that we would expect the dpg margins to be near the low end of that range i don’t think we can give specific guidance and comments as to whether its slightly as above or slightly below and both of those are in the play richard j giromini yes john we are not trying to be a elusive or evasive it’s difficult to project even at this point in the quarter what the ultimate shipments are we recognize revenue we could actually ship the equipment we can do some internal modeling but at the end of the day it really comes down to what mix of products ends up shipping for the quarter that’s what’s the elusive thing and trying to respond to that question john r mims – fbr capital markets  co okay yes that makes sense and that’s what i wanted to clear up because i feel like go into  and then realize that’s you get – you could probably get their above fourth quarter but that’s a lot to make up when you are still working through some of that backlog so just whether sure if i misinterpreted you know that the range come out but that’s helpful let me ask on the commercial trailer side given that orders are strong as they have been backlog as where it is are you totally full from a build standpoint for the rest of this year or do you have some triage and kind of flexibility as far as what you can do to leverage more pricing from guides in the back half jeffery l taylor there is always some opportunity to leverage capacity and we can do that through over time and that the areas were we probably have the least amount of open available capacity would be in the drivein segment orders have been very very strong in the drivein segment in the refrigerator there is always some opportunity in the flatbed business that typically doesn’t have the long lead times its typically  to  weeks more typical than what you know when you see about six months we are talking about in the aggregate so that area of the business continually is quoting and taking orders even for the current model year the current calendar year so these are some flexibility if an opportunity comes along there is a dedicated contract orders that customer gets it’s a reasonably short lead item that they need and there willing to pay the premium to have us open up some week end slots then we may consider taking advantage of that opportunity so we always have some flexibility john r mims – fbr capital markets  co okay that makes sense so i mean assuming and where you comment if im right or not but given the industry the order trends and how tight most people are that you are getting more pricing power even in your standard dry vans now than you were earlier in this year and certainly at this point last year so if everybody is kind of enjoying a little bit of that tailwind when is it reasonable it is moreover of a  or maybe a little bit earlier that it’s reasonable to see a pickup in asps again just on to your standard dry products richard j giromini yes let me touch on because that brings up a couple of points i want to reinforce the asp and i know that we threw a lot of numbers at you earlier on what happened with asps in the commercial trailer products business a good portion of that was i think  of that deterioration was strictly tied to the significant increase and customers opting to supply tires so the tire value is not included in the price of those trailers when they get shipped and recognized so that’s a little bit unique and when we look at yearoveryear basis this  customer supplied tires were at the highest level ever between  times to  times on a percentage of units that customers elected to do that so that moves to needle on that so that one is unpredictable as to what they would elected to do as we quote for the  calendar year whether they elect to supply tires on their own or have us procure tires in the marketplace so it’s not a deterioration in price and i know some folks have looked at it and thinking that price deteriorated quite opposite price was improving during the same time but it was in a way overwhelmed in the numbers by the customer supply tire side of it but as we get into the  quoting season that’s when some nice gains can be made in pricing if we go back to the normal quote and order patterns for the ctp business in particular recall that during the fall and early spring or actually early winter season of the year so the october november december january february months tend to be very very strong months for large customer larger order intake and by the time you get through that period you have got a good portion of your backlog for the year already established and the pricing at that time is lower than what it’s going to be this coming fall so i just say that because it’s a smaller order the smaller customers that were able to continue to push pricing as we go throughout the year once we locked with the big guys it’s locked for the fullyear so if the orders that they are placed in the october november december timeframe are for all months of the following year so you have those locks so it does take time when you have your pricing initiatives to start showing and taking hold and that’s why as we progress to the year and we have shown this in the last two to three years that we continue to have some pricing improvement because of the smaller orders coming it gives us the opportunity to access what the market is and our ability to continue to push pricing into the market so is this next quote season as we’re just entering now we feel very good about where the demand environment is and the ability to be able to continue to push pricing for the  john r mims – fbr capital markets  co sure that makes total sense and i understand the tire disparity i didn’t think that was a decline in price at all but i guess what i was asking more you seen kind of in may and june from industry basis the sort of bucking of seasonal trends for orders have stayed really strong instead of kind of starting to fall off and maybe you can comment on how that’s trending in july but if you are taking more and more of these small orders now and you are starting to push maybe production for some of these into  as you enter the big order season this fall are you in the scenario where there is already enough build capacity taken up from the orders that you are receiving now that you can be more aggressive with pricing with the bigger guys that makes sense richard j giromini yes the vast vast majority of orders that have been accepted are for  builds just to clarifying so its not that we are taking small orders for  at this point but the same notion does hold true in what you are saying is that the position we are in today does provide and the strong demand environment and the expectations for continued strong demand for next year does put us in a much better position than we were a yearago at this time when it comes to pricing those very large customer large order quotes john r mims – fbr capital markets  co and then just a quick comment on july order trends versus normal seasonality jeffery l taylor the quote activity has continued to be favorable relative to prior periods when you look at on a seasonally adjusted basis and you look historically the trends that weve seen over this quoting year had been favorable to what we had seen in previous years so that has given us more and more confidence in our projections in our ability to be a little bit more bold about the projections we wanted to be sure the last quarter before we went and changed anything we were out ahead of act as you recall at the beginning of the year they were at the  to  yearoveryear projection we were at  to  some folks thought we were being too aggressive but we were confident based on conversations with our customers and what we were receiving from early quote activity and what we did know is would that be able to continue with the strength as we progress throughout the second quarter and as we now know it has even surprised us with the amount of strength that’s continued and of course of both act and ftr have caught and had passed us but now with the backlog fill that we’ve been able to gain we feel confident in going out with the much stronger numbers john r mims – fbr capital markets  co how much that do you think is more still a replacement driven versus real kind of fleets i mean trailer fleet growth the drop and hook and all of those sort of secular trends richard j giromini yes its always hard to sort out customer don’t tell us they want a  trailers they don’t say  of them for replacement and  are for additional drop and hook we don’t know how they actually use the fleet my belief is that the was majority are driven by replacement you are always going to have some growth at some customer trying to gain some new lanes and new customers that they are going to have some needs but the vast majority is really catchup replacement as a result of the very deep and protracted down term we went through where very few people were spending any money on replacing equipment and now the fleet is excessively aged and you have got this very very tough regulatory environment and with the csa regs and indiscernible that putting even more pressure on fleets so the vast majority is replacement john r mims – fbr capital markets  co great well yeah it sounds like it can continue for a while thank you so much for all the time operator and our last question comes from jeff kauffman jeff please go ahead jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group thanks so much hey guys richard j giromini hey jeff jeffery l taylor hi jeff jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group question of a quality type there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet which is great i know you are paying down debt i know you haven’t made any acquisitions yet this year but we should getting a more positive working capital profile in the second half of the year which means more cash what are your thoughts on managing that cash right now richard j giromini thanks jeff i was wondering if we were going to get through the call without having the capital structure question but i think taking that yes i think the answer to that is its stay the course weve said i think for the last four to six quarters that we’re focused on managing our debt and as you mentioned we did make an additional  million voluntary prepayment against the term loan in the second quarter so that’s the primary focus managing debt and evaluation strategic opportunities to grow the business i think to your point we do typically recover working capital in the second half of the year and in my comments i did mention that we could see a slight increase in working capital in the third quarter but in general the second quarter is very favorable for us from a recovery perspective in generating good cash flow so jeffery l taylor yes jeff i’ll just add that we made a commitment one to address the debt side and we’ve gotten to one of our first thresholds and that was getting under the two times on a net basis ratio that we want it we’ve also made the commitment to continue to look for ways to grow and diversify this business both with our organic efforts which due take investment from timetotime but also strategically through acquisition and we are now in a much better position to be able to look at those types of opportunities with a lot more confidence and maybe we were a year ago because us wanting to put the heavy priority on the debt reduction and getting our ratio more comfortable level so we gotten ourselves with a lot more flexibility to take advantage of some opportunities that we may have considered overtime jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group all right so i guess the way i interpret that is if we don’t see strategic opportunity in the second half of the year do we maybe think about getting even more aggressive with the pace of debt reduction jeffery l taylor yes jeff i think we look at the those actions on a quarterbyquarter basis that’s the process we’ve had for the last like i said four quarters to six quarters i think that’s the process will continue its work for well for us so we will take it quarterbyquarter and see where we are and see what opportunities we have in the company over evaluate where we get the best flexibility and the best return from the various options we have available to us and we’ll makes decision at that point jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group okay well please remind me when do we start to anniversary these mix imbalances on the ctp side richard j giromini yes i think that’s a fair question jeff if we were to go back year ago we have target at the go to  target between the large direct accounts the indirect speaking to the ctp business because that’s where the mixed effect really placed when within the segment we are always going to have to deal with and discuss mixed issues related from segmenttosegment as one segment may grow faster than another or they cyclical demands are seasonal demands for ctp which overshadows the dpg so that the part of it won’t go away but within the segment within ctp i think what we are seeing now as we get into this level in the cycle with the big guys really going after addressing the replacement of fleets while we are going to continue to push for the  it’s probably more likely that the  ratio is probably going to be more realistic there is just so much buying power that the larger guys have that i think it’s going to be tougher and tougher to get for the  without just walk in a way from some other so that’s your point the anniversaries have we are probably get into that point where it looks like quarteroverquarter we may have some benefit from one quarter to the next but over the course of the year’s time maybe we’ll say  to  rather  to  would be  might be about as good as and get and we will just see how goes but we don’t want to make it a significant issue from quartertoquarter it’s not our intention we are just trying to lay it out for you that we do have that issue and because of the huge difference between asps within ctp type product versus asps within dpg that it can really move the need when you have some shifts like that so jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group okay i understood the tec trailer conversions where we are going to start to see some of those retail trailers show up and ctp i think you mentioned  trailers number one is that an annual number two when should we start seeing that transition into the ctp numbers jeffery l taylor yes jeff that is an annual number that was the new trailer shipments form those three locations in  so it’s a fullyear number that transition was effective i think june st jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group june st jeffery l taylor effective june st and tec is our west coast dealer representing us in three states out there jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group okay then one last question you mentioned the startup cost related to a new product and i think i heard you say modal box that sounds a lot like a container to me could you give us a better idea you are getting back into the container business or is this something kind of unique for a very specific customer purpose jeffery l taylor yes it’s a unique solution its referred to as a mobile truck box and it actually its an efficiency improvement on how hand load materials are managed for ltl instead of manually loading one box at a time they are staged in these boxes external to the trucks and then this box is put within the truck within the trailer and its just an operational efficiency improvement that has some really nice potential related to it it speeds up improves velocity for the ltl and being able to manage when they do their loading and unloading so form distribution center so it’s in our mind a big improvement in operational efficiency its in its early stage but the launch was more challenging than what had been anticipated and a little bit unique in what we have experienced with these type of launches and that’s why it was notable we hope we don’t have any more notable ones to have to speak up and going forward so there was a big lessons learned review on this whole thing to identify what went wrong in the launch of it so that we don’t have a recurrence of that going forward so we are expecting that to be a one and only and we will see how we do on that jeffrey a kauffman – buckingham research group all right guys well congratulations and thank you jeffery l taylor thanks jeff operator we have no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back over to dick please go ahead richard j giromini thank you vivian well in collusion we are pleased with the results we are able to deliver overall in the second quarter  and that said we continue to see further opportunities to accelerate topline growth expand our product to market breadth and to deliver even greater performance in almost all aspects of our business with a key focus on execution and delivering results im certainly confident that we will do just that thank you for your interest and support of wabash national corporation jeff and i look forward to speaking with all
