moseley lang and brownlakeith amir–sharif pro se donna c peavler for quick trip corporation and chester cadieux iii opinionlakeith amir–sharif a pro se inmate appeals the trial courts orders declaring him a vexatious litigant and dismissing his lawsuit against quick trip corporation and chester cadieux iii without prejudice in six issues amir–sharif argues  the trial court erred when it signed the order declaring him a vexatious litigant because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing and his appearance was due to a bench warrant which resulted in an “ambush hearing”  the trial court erred when it signed the order declaring him a vexatious litigant because the trial court had a ministerial duty to ensure that he was provided with the requisite advance notice of that hearing pursuant to section a of the texas civil practice and remedies code  the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial courts order declaring him a vexatious litigant  the trial court erred when it failed to file the requested findings of fact and conclusions of law  the trial court erred when it failed to have a hearing on his motions to reconsider the trial courts orders declaring him a vexatious litigant and dismissing his lawsuit  the trial court erred as a matter of law when it signed the orders declaring him a vexatious litigant and dismissing his lawsuit because it failed to apply the “liberal construction” standard to his pleadingswe conclude the evidence is legally insufficient to support the order declaring amir–sharif a vexatious litigant the trial courts orders are reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinioni factual and procedural backgroundin his original petition amir–sharif filed a premises liability

to the hearing scheduled for that date and sought a continuance in response counsel for quick trip and cadieux sent amir–sharif a letter by certified mail stating that in accordance with his request the hearing was rescheduled for october   however it appears from the record on appeal that the hearing did not go forwardon february   the trial court signed an order that sua sponte determined the

be a vexatious litigant see amir–sharif v zeller no –––cv  wl   texappamarillo feb   pet denied memop stating amir–sharif contends trial court erred in finding him to be a vexatious litigant however it was not clear whether the nd district court swisher county texas had rendered a prefiling order and amir–sharif was not listed on the office of court administrations list of vexatious litigants posted on its website as a result of any order by the nd district court see tex civ prac remcode ann §  west supp section a of the texas civil practice and remedies code provides that after a person has been found to be a vexatious litigant “a court may ․ enter an order prohibiting a person from filing in propria persona a new litigation in a court in this state” see tex civ prac remcode ann § a as a result this court requested the parties to provide letter briefs addressing the issue of whether this appeal was moot as a result of any prior state court orders declaring amir–sharif to be a vexatious litigant together with sworn or certified copies of any relevant state court ordersquick trip and cadieaux filed a certified copy of the nd district courts order that order did not include a prefiling order pursuant to texas civil practice and remedies code section a see also in re amir–sharif no ––  wl   n  texappamarillo aug   orig proceeding memop accordingly we conclude this appeal is not mootii sufficiency of the evidencein issue three amir–sharif argues the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial courts order declaring him a vexatious litigant amir–sharif argues in part the followingthe trial court abused its discretion and committed reversible error by failing to correctly apply the law at §  texas civil practice and remedies code which contains a “two  prong” prerequisite quick trip and cadieux must bear the burden of establishing before amir–sharif can be declared a vexatious litigant․under section  there are two  distinctive criterias sic that must first be met by quick trip and cadieux quick trip and cadieux must prove  amir–sharif has no realistic probability of prevailing on the claims presented in his lawsuit and  that the factual requisite delineated under one of the three subsections of §  applies to amir–sharif․ amir–sharif has not only proffered his medical records but also documentation of his communication with quick trip and cadieuxs accident claims department record citation omitted․ if ever presented to a jury amir–sharifs negligence and premises liability claims do have a reasonable probability for success particularly in light of the supporting medical records profferedon appeal amir–sharif does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence showing that he has maintained in excess of five lawsuits that were determined to be frivolous dismissed for want of prosecution or decided adversely to him quick trip and cadieux respond that with regard to amir–sharifs negligence claim alleging a premises defect he has no evidence that there was an unreasonably dangerous condition or that quick trip and cadieux had actual or constructive knowledge of the unreasonable dangerous conditiona standard of reviewan appellate court reviews a trial courts declaration that a litigant is vexatious for an abuse of discretion amir–sharif  wl  at  harris v rose  swd   texappdallas  no pet however a trial courts findings under chapter  of the texas civil practice and remedies code may be reviewed for legal and factual sufficiency because section  requires the trial court to make evidentiary findings willms v americas tire co  swd   texappdallas  pet denied leonard v abbott  swd   texappaustin  pet deniedwhen examining a legal sufficiency challenge an appellate court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the challenged finding and indulges every reasonable inference that would support it city of keller v wilson  swd   tex the ultimate test for legal sufficiency is whether the evidence would enable a reasonable and fairminded fact finder to reach the verdict under review city of keller  swd at  the fact finder is the sole judge of witness credibility and the weight to give to the testimony see city of keller  swd at b applicable lawa court may find a plaintiff a vexatious litigant if the defendant shows  there is not a reasonable probability the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation and  there is other evidence regarding previous litigations by the defendant tex civ prac remcode ann §  willms  swd at  other evidence involving previous litigation may include evidence that the plaintiff in the seven year period immediately preceding the date the defendant makes the motion under section  has commenced prosecuted or maintained in propria persona at least five litigations other than in small claims court that have been a finally determined adversely to the plaintiff b permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing or c determined by a trial or appellate court to be frivolous or groundless under state or federal laws or rules of procedure tex civ prac remcode ann § a b and cthe defendant seeking a vexatious litigant declaration bears the burden of establishing both parts of the test set out in section  of the texas civil practice and remedies code tex civ prac remcode ann §  court may find plaintiff vexatious “if the defendant shows” no reasonable probability of prevailing and one of the three litigation histories drake v andrews  swd   texappdallas  pet denied the plaintiff may offer evidence to show there is a reasonable probability he will prevail in the litigation but it is not his burden to do so drake  swd at – when the defendant offers evidence sufficient to satisfy the second part of the test relating to litigation history but fails to offer any evidence showing why the plaintiff could not prevail in the suit the defendant has failed to meet his burden drake  swd at –c application of the law to the factsin his second amended civil complaint amir–sharif sued quick trip and cadieux “under the common law theories of negligence and personal injury and premises liability” in their motion seeking to declare amir–sharif a vexatious litigant quick trip and cadieux argued that amir–sharifs cause of action was a negligence claim alleging a premises defect they maintained in their motion in part that amir–sharif had “no evidence” that there was an unreasonably dangerous condition and that they had actual or constructive knowledge of the unreasonably dangerous conditionat the outset of the hearing on quick trip and cadieuxs motion to declare amir–sharif a vexatious litigant when the trial court invited counsel for quick trip and cadieux to proceed with their offer of evidence counsel stated “there is not actually any evidence with regard to testimony” then quick trip and cadieux offered evidence of amir–sharifs pro se litigation history which amir–sharif did not contest in response amir–sharif argued in part that quick trip and cadieux “have only shown that they had previous cases” “they havent shown the trial court anything that shows where he cant prove his claim” and “they havent—the two criterias sic havent been met here for the trial court—for them to—for their motion to be granted” amir–sharif also cited this courts opinion of drake v andrews  swd  texappdallas  pet denied quick trip and cadieux repliedwe have to show that amir–sharif has no reasonable probability to prevail in this claim he has filed a premises liability claim he has to prove that quick trip had actual constructive notice of this premises defecthe cant show that there is not going to be any evidence of their actual knowledge of this substance on the ground because he is not going to be able to get that evidence there wont be any such evidence he has no reasonable probability of prevailing on this claimthen the trial court asked amir–sharif what evidence he had that the condition he claimed caused his injury existed for such a period of time that quick trip and cadieux reasonably should have known of it or that they had actual knowledge of it amir–sharif responded thatthere are other witnesses who were there who—who i intend to have come before this court and testify that the water or liquid whatever was on that floor was there prior to my coming in theremr cory vaughn who i also named as a defendant in this case when the incident happened he came and apologized and said that he had gotten busy and thats why i had initially named him as a defendant you could just bring him into court i have been desperately trying to get him served so we can bring him into court and let him explain what happenedwithout the discovery which i have requested from them we cant find out their—their—they had like inspection—inspection slips where they were cleaning up i have asked—i have asked quick trip and cadieuxs counsel for those documents and they are resisting that therethis is what—i didnt—and my understanding was that the suit im alleging personal injury and premises liability they knew or should have known that the—that that water or liquid was there if they—if they go and survey or look around the premises in a timely manner and they didnt they couldnt have had they done so they would have cleaned it up someone would have seen it and cleaned it upmr vaughns statement to me in front of other people that he apologized because he had gotten busy that—that—that kind of infers that you know you got behind and maybe this here was there and he could have found it before the incident took place but he didnt and i was injured as a result of thatafter this argument by amir–sharif the trial court inquired whether there was anything further from either side and both parties responded that there was notin this case quick trip and cadieux offered evidence of amir–sharifs pro se litigation history which appears sufficient to satisfy the second part of the test set out in section  of the texas civil practice and remedies code see drake  swd at – however quick trip and cadieux offered only argument but no evidence showing why amir–sharif could not prevail in this litigation see drake  swd at – section  specifically states that “a court may find a plaintiff a vexatious litigant if the defendant shows that there is no reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in the litigation against the defendant” and one of the three litigation histories tex civ prac remcode ann §  emphasis added see drake  swd at after reviewing the record on appeal we conclude quick trip and cadieux failed to carry their burden and the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial courts order declaring amir–sharif a vexatious litigant issue three is decided in favor of amir–sharifviii conclusionthe evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial courts order declaring amir–sharif a vexatious litigantthe trial courts orders are reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinionfootnotes  during the hearing on quick trip
