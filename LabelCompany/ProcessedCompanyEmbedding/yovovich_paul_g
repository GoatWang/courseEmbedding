и анализа тзв „америчког раскола“  и предлози за његово превазилажење епископ атанасије јевтић у издању севастијан преса из лос анђелеса и братства св симона мироточивог из врњачке бање недавно је изашла нова књига атанасија јевтића умировљеног владике херцеговачког савремени еклисиолошки подсетник о дијаспори  историја и анализа тзв „америчког раскола“  и предлози за његово превазилажење текст ове књиге је написан сада већ далеке године и до данас био необјављен будући да је само за синодске оце архијереје био намењен ради превазилажења тзв „америчког раскола“ данас када је тај српски раскол литургијски и административно превазиђен сасвим је разумљиво и пожељно било да се овај текст предочи јавности на молбу светог архијерејског синода ондашњи јеромонах атанасије је сва питања везана за болни раскол у српској дијаспори ставио под светлост православне еклисиологије и предања што је био једини начин за њихово суочавање како би се дошло што ближе до зацељивања раскола читалац ће приметити како је он савесно и непристрасно проанализирао цело питање раскола и дао целисходне икономијске предлоге за његово решење ова књига је резултат његовог савесног христољубивог и црквољубивог рада конкретан резултат атанасијевог еклисиолошког предлога била је обнова евхаристијског општења и помирења које је постигнуто на празник сретења господњег  фебруара  године у саборној цркви у београду када су српски патријарх павле и чланови светог архијерејског сабора служили са митрополитом иринејем ковачевићем дотадашњим епископом у расколу коначно  маја  године свети архијерејски сабор је донео одлуку и о коначном административном јединству српске цркве у северној и јужној америци истовремено ова књига осветљава битно питање дијаспоре дијаспора је пред православну цркву поставила два битна проблема питање провере исправности нашег схватања цркве оног које се у последњим вековима код многих од нас усталило и питање мисије цркве у свету књига је изашла са благословом епископа новограчаничког и средњезападноамеричког лонгина и епископа западноамеричког максима књигу можете наручити по цени од  кодwestern american diocese west garvey avenue alhambra ca

purchasing contemporary ecclesiological reminderon the diasporahistory and analysis of so called “american schism”  and recommendations for its overcoming by bishop athanasius yevtich recently a new book by athanasius yevtich retired bishop of herzegovina was published in serbian by sebastian press of los angeles in cooperation with st simeon the myrrhstreaming of vrnjacka banja this book was written in a now already distant year of  this is its first publishing since the original intent was to have it available only for the hierarchs of the holy synod for the purpose of overcoming the socalled “american schism” within the serbian diaspora presently as the serbian schism has been liturgically and administratively vanquished it is understandable and desirable to have this valuable research available to the public at the request of the holy synod back then hieromonk atanasije acceded to collect all relevant documents in reference to painful schism in serbian diaspora placing them in the light of orthodox ecclesiology and holy tradition which was the only way to face it properly and bring it closer to healingthe readers will notice how bishop atanasije analyzed responsibly and impartially the whole question of schism and at the same time provided comprehensive integral and thorough ecclesial economy recomendations for solutionsthis book is the result of his christloving and churchloving labor a tangible result of atanasijes ecclesiological recommendation was the eucharistic renewal communion and reconciliation which was established on the feast of the meeting of the lord in the temple february   at the cathedral in belgrade his holiness patriarch paul and hierarchs of the holy episcopal assembly celebrated for the first time together since the schism with metropolitan iriney kovacevic up until then schismatic bishop in diasporafinally on may   the holy assembly made a decission about conclusive administrative unity of the serbian orthodox church in north and south america in the same time this book reveals crucial question regarding diaspora because ecclesial organization of the orthodox church abroad presents itself with at least two problems a a checkup of our interpretation and comprehension of the church especifically of the last couple of centuries existing convictions and b a question of the church mission in the world this book is published with the blessings of his grace bishop longin of new gracanica  midwestern america and his grace bishop maxim of western american diocese of the serbian orthodox church for north and south
