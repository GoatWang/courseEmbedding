professionals from a variety of disciplines includes implementation of the methods using statistical software emphasizes the powerful methodology of mle provides detailed graphical explanations of methods provides auxiliary materials online summary since the publication of the second edition of applied reliability in  the ready availability of inexpensive powerful statistical software has changed the way statisticians and engineers look at and analyze all kinds of data problems in reliability that were once difficult and time consuming even for experts can now be solved with a few wellchosen clicks of a mouse however software documentation has had difficulty keeping up with the enhanced functionality added to new releases especially in specialized areas such as reliability analysis using analysis capabilities in spreadsheet software and two wellmaintained supported and frequently updated popular software packages—minitab and sas jmp—the third edition of applied reliability is an easytouse guide to basic descriptive statistics reliability concepts and the properties of lifetime distributions such as the exponential weibull and lognormal the material covers reliability data plotting acceleration models life test data analysis systems models and much more the third edition includes a new chapter on bayesian reliability analysis and expanded updated coverage of repairable system modeling taking a practical and exampleoriented approach to reliability analysis this book provides detailed illustrations of software implementation throughout and more than  workedout examples done with jmp minitab and several spreadsheet programs in addition there are nearly  figures hundreds of exercises and additional problems at the end of each chapter and new

book for an introduction to reliability course for over  years … the third edition … retains the features i liked about the second edition in addition it includes improved graphics … and examples of popular software used in industry … there is a new chapter on bayesian reliability and additional material on reliability data plotting and repairable systems’ analysis … the book does a good and comprehensive job of explaining the basic reliability concepts types of data encountered in practice and how to treat this data reliability data plotting and the common probability distributions used in reliability work including motivations for their use and practical areas of application … an excellent choice for a first course in reliability the book also does a good job of explaining more
