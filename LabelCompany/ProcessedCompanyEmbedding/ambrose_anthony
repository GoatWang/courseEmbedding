team has increased automated systems capacity about  since q of last year to support our customers ramp and maintain ontime delivery performance and quality we will continue to increase capacity per systems in q through improved efficiency optimize capacity planning and relentless focus on last quarters conference call i reviewed our companys strategic imperatives for  weve largely completed our turnaround and are now focused on the growth opportunities in automotive and secured internet of things our first imperative was to grow revenue and seize the new market opportunities in our core business as we discussed in the final release we had growth in all major product lines and key international geographic markets this is consistent with the doubling of the available market by  that we forecasted in early  we showed how this was driven by automotive electronics the internet of things and factory automation our strong growth in market share in automotive electronics reinforce our belief that were in the wave of a new and exciting electronic content including automotive infotainment and instrument cluster applications advanced driver assist systems increased use of electric hybrid engines and powertrains and generally more systems to support autonomous driving strategies from leading automotive oems the strong performance in q was driven largely by our psv family of programming systems featuring the lumenx programming and flashcore iii programming technology which are setting new standards in technological innovation imperative number two is to enhance and extend our platforms in programming technologies we have significantly increased our rd spending to support our current products and to develop the sentrix security programming technology recently demonstrated at the embedded world event in germany last march the increase of  in rd year over year includes hiring several engineers and other development expenses and variable costs in engineering our new connex smart programming software which was announced in q is integrated with our high growth psv systems this technology addresses the heightening demand for extensive traceability process monitoring and predictive analytics particularly within the automotive electronics market as we previously discussed were now seeing demand and requirements for a much more secure internet of things a new generation of security solutions within authentication devices other secure elements and secure microcontrollers are expected to gain share over the next several years these trends in silicon technology and oem demands create a new opportunity in managed and secure programming and were investing to lead the industry in a potential market of  billion units in  according to abi research and company estimates as the global leader in firmware provisioning were partnering with the leading suppliers of secure elements and secure microcontrollers as well as industry security experts to develop high volume cost effective security provisioning solutions in q we announced key partnerships with renesas infineon ebv avnet and renaissance infineon ebv avnet and secure thingz in this growing market we view the next  months as largely a market development phase to establish our key design wins and relationships with meaningful revenue to follow from there our next imperative was to market and sell our products globally as the transition from manual to automated manufacturing processes continues worldwide we appear to be gaining market share in all of our markets our installed base continues to show good growth and also drives increasing consumable sales as our adapter business in q was very strong with revenues of about  million our current sales funnel is strong driven by the automotive market and programming centers finally id like to remind all of our shareholders that the annual meeting will be held may   at  in the morning here data io we invite all of our shareholders in the area to attend id like to turn the call over now to joel hatlen our cfo for a more detailed review of our numbers joel joel hatlen thank you anthony good day to everyone net sales in the first quarter of  were  million compared with  million in the first quarter of  as anthony noted automotive electronics and the internet of things demand from both oems and programming centers drove increased revenues primarily related to our psv family of automated programming systems revenues from adapters and consumable were up  revenue composition for the quarter was approximately  from equipment  from consumables and  from software and services international sales represented approximately  of total sales for the first quarter and compared to  in  first quarter and regionally had the strongest growth in europe order bookings were  million in the first quarter of  a  year high compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  or a sequential growth of  and from  million in the first quarter of last year for a year over year growth of  the variation in revenue percentages versus order percentages relate to the change in deferred revenues and currency translation backlog at the end of the quarter was  million on march   compared to  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  and  million at the end of the first quarter of  deferred revenue at the end of the first quarter was  million compared to  million at december   for the first quarter of  gross margin as a percentage of sales was  compared to  in the first quarter of  and  in the fourth quarter of  the increase was primarily due to favorable factory variances sales volumes which resulted in better fixed factory cost utilization and a favorable product mix operating expenses were  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the same period of  the increase was primarily due to additional engineering incentive consultant and commission and compensation as well as costs associated with new hires in large part associated with our new managed and secure programming platform looking forward the higher level of rd expense incurred during the first quarter will continue in  as we prepare for revenue generation for this newer platform in  however our growths from the current business lines has more than offset the increased spending on next generation development in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap net income in the first quarter of  was  or  per diluted share compared with a net loss of  or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  included in nonoperating income were gains of  from sales of noncore internet domain assets ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization was  million in the first quarter of  compared to an ebitda loss  in the first quarter of  equity compensation a noncash item in the first quarter of  and  were  and  respectively adjusted ebitda excluding equity compensation was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  in the first quarter of  please see our press release for a discussion and reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures we have net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  million as well as other credit carryforwards in the us that are available to continue to offset our future us net income and we will continue to analyze and manage taxes to take advantage of these tax attributes during the first quarter of  no shares were purchased under the companys share repurchase program which expired on march   overall a total of  shares were purchased at an average price of  under the program the companys cash position at march   was  million with approximately  million in the united states and the balance in foreign subsidiaries working capital increased to  million at the end of the first quarter from  million at the beginning of the year the company remains debt free and had  shares outstanding at march   at this point ill turn the discussion back to anthony anthony ambrose thank you very much joel at this point id like to turn the call over to jordan and our moderator so we can entertain questions from the call jordan jordan darrow okay thank you operator would you please introduce the qa process and then take callers as they come in questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question will come from robert anderson with penbrook go ahead please robert anderson my question relates to the increased rd spending and the reference in your talk about research for a next generation of products maybe you could say a little more about the next generation of products which i guess have security features anthony ambrose correct were focused on the products we demonstrated and announced in q our sentrix platform and we demonstrated these at the embedded world trade show event in nuremberg germany in midmarch what sentrix does is it allows customers to secure their internet of things devices which allows them to secure their supply chain and also maintain firmware integrity on their iot devices over the life cycle of the product when you boil it all down this means things like the hacks you read about in the newspaper people using internet of things devices to get into peoples gmail accounts or hacking their services or finding out their passwords and credentials all that can be stopped because the oems that build iot devices now have a way to make sure that they can control that firmware update process in a very secure manner starting from when the device is born in the manufacturing process and thats where we come in with sentrix what we demonstrated was a sentrix working on the infineon optiga trust e which is an authentication ic and also we announced our partnership with renesas on the secure microcontroller products family they have just announced which is called the synergy product family and were very excited about that because renesas is a global leader in microcontrollers and infineon is a global leader in authentication ics so a good chunk of the rd went into the sentrix platform we also have rd initiatives to enhance and extend the lumenx programmer continued releases there continued feature enhancements on the psv and  usually targeting our automotive and programming center and industrial customers so thats where the spending is going robert anderson is it fair to say then that this new technology will appeal obviously to the automotive customers but it will gradually spread to many sectors of the semiconductor industry anthony ambrose absolutely bob the security is becoming a requirement not just in automotive although the automotive market is very keen on it but just in the general internet of things market when you look at where internet of things devices are going they simply have to be secured and oem customers are looking for a simple easy way to do that that doesnt require them to vastly change how they build their products and vastly change their factories and thats where we think sentrix can really help them out operator our next question will come from adam hutt with lpartners go ahead please adam hutt i was with leviticus partners of course you might remember me so as you look at the market now for the security authentication product now for the iot market looking out several years very longterm as you know we are longterm investors how big can it be anthony ambrose well we rely on a lot of the market forecasts we use abi and weve included that in some of our materials to show its about a billionunit total available market in a billionunit microcontroller total available market by about  so were excited about that because that represents a significant upside in our total available market compared to where we are today so thats probably the best market we have out in the future and within that more specifically were trying to find and work with the industry leaders on their specific product lines the microcontroller market is fairly heavily segmented market leaders have about  share and so our goal is to work with the industry leaders to support their newest generations of products and so as they mature well mature with them and grow with them adam hutt but to do the margin math on i mean back in the day fred hume used to talk about getting anywhere from  to maybe  per unit and prevent cisco counterfeit boxes from going to the army and stuff like that so what are we talking about there are you guys looking to get several pennies for every iot device and how many devices do you think its possible that you could be in in  anthony ambrose yes adam i think at this point given that we have a lot of competitors always on our call id just like to leave it that were going after the billionunit market and we can serve it profitably and as we get closer well have more to say on that adam hutt okay thank you guys good luck operator our next question will come from david kanen with kanen wealth management go ahead please david kanen first question is these new products are clearly incremental implicitly one could have come to the conclusion that theyre replacing our core business but the managed security initiative is purely incremental to our core business is that correct anthony ambrose thats correct dave david kanen okay so you use the term you said youre announcing some partnerships renesas and i forgot what the other one was but you expect meaningful revenue from there how would you define meaningful not to belabor the point but does this incremental opportunity have the potential to be the same size as your core business anthony ambrose we havent gone into that level of detail dave and i think the key point i was trying to make here was that in  the focus for us this year is on developing the technology and developing the relationships its not a revenue generation year we havent given out a revenue forecast on what this can do i just want to point out that again were looking at about a billionunit market and were trying to work with the market leaders in there david kanen okay is this something in  that will be incremental anthony ambrose yes i think youll start to see it in  as we get closer to  ill have more specific information i guess my message is its not incremental material revenue in  thats clear david kanen okay and then my other question is in regard to your connex software if im pronouncing it correctly traceability and factory automation integration i know you had some software components to your existing automated systems how much of this is incremental and then if you can give us a sense as to the margin impact on this going forward anthony ambrose so i think the way to look at connex is we believe that this is something thats going to be necessary as customers move towards a more complete factory automation and smart factory initiative and you can look at a number of industry players the people that build the smt lines the leading suppliers there all have initiatives to bring together the various pieces of an smt line into a way thats much easier to manage and much easier to control centrally from the customers mes or manufacturing and equipment systems so we intend to support that we have had the fis or factory integration software on our roadrunner products for years this makes it much easier to integrate across various programmers and handlers in a unified and simplified manner to cut right to the chase technically the output is xml which means that you and i could even code something in about half an hour with xml and it makes it a lot easier to present that interface to a variety of different customer systems and allow them to integrate it without having us to spend a lot of time helping them so thats the significance of connex its mildly incremental i guess i characterize it that way but we think it also gives our systems a compelling advantage for customers that want to go into that factory automation space joel hatlen and really its a core building block for the whole security offering anthony ambrose exactly david kanen then im going to ask one more quick question and then ill go back into queue just the cadence or seasonality typically as we work through the year can you just comment on that anthony ambrose well i think dave the seasonality that  we normally would have expected business to soften between thanksgiving and chinese new year that did not happen this year we blew right through that when you look at the q numbers i talked about how strong december was we had strength right from the beginning of the year in q and its continued so this year is its not following a typical seasonal pattern in the sense that thanksgiving to chinese new year period turned out to be quite strong david kanen so typically what are your strongest quarters anthony ambrose typically it would be q and q david kanen okay good luck thanks guys wont see in seattle too far operator well go next to indiscernible with magnolia capital go ahead please unidentified analyst wanted to ask just a couple of questions around your managed and secure platform and the first was just thinking about rd spending or investment there can you elaborate a little maybe help us think about what percentage of rd is going into that new platform and whether youre doing that internally or are you outsourcing portions of that software engineering to other parties anthony ambrose matt we havent broken out the specific percentages that are going into manage and secure programing and i probably wont do that for competitive reasons but the key point id like to make is most of its internal we do make use of consultants and external resources from time to time in rd to help us solve specific problems but when we have a core capability we try and get it done internally and so most of our rd spend is internal unidentified analyst and then in terms of that platform you discussed earlier that this is mainly a  revenue contributor but can you address maybe kind of market size and how to think about early growth in that platform and maybe a little about the competition and how you stack up your competitive advantages against those competitors as you bring this out anthony ambrose sure the process today to get a device secured requires you to get it done with the semiconductor manufacturer at the wafer level and that works well if youre a really big company or if you have a very predictable demand cycle and if you exceed their minimum order quantity and minimum lead times what we found is there is a significant piece of the market that is not servable by that current model and the semiconductor companies themselves are very excited about working with us because they think they can grow their market for these personalization capabilities that already exist in their silicon so were helping them go after a market that we all believe can be profitably served but is not being served today and so our competitive advantage is we have a great platform we have the ability to work within the industry structure as it exists today so people dont need to tear up all their factories or all their business processes to implement this and at the same time the semiconductor companies like it because it expands their markets additionally weve got a number of our patents filed and in the approval process so our strategy is to have the best product be the best supplier be protected from an ip standpoint and a knowhow standpoint operator our next question is from art winston with pilot advisors go ahead please art winston in terms of the european business i assume it came from the four or five major automotive oem manufacturers in europe anthony ambrose european business art is primarily automotive and automotive programming centers so yes the vast majority of the business comes from the automotive segment in europe art winston and but its not necessarily from the oems that manufacture themselves anthony ambrose no think of the supply chain goes through people like the leading automotive electronics companies and then they would sell to the nameplates art winston understood is there any reason to believe that given the really preponderance of the increase in automotive electronics so basically this business is just going to keep going and going at the rate it is particularly in europe the automotive part anthony ambrose yes art thats a really good point and i think ive been talking about and i think ive been talking about automotive on these calls for at least a couple of years the fundamental long term trends in automotive are pretty visible if you go out and look what everyone is saying around infotainment platforms around advanced driver assist systems either for safety or ultimately for autonomous driving and the rapid emergence of hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles the nice thing about a hybrid is they have to build an electrical engine and powertrain and a gasoline engine and powertrain and i think with the demise of diesel youre seeing more and more pressure to move more quickly to electric and hybrid and then finally mobility and autonomous driving also drive electric content in cars this is a multiyear trend art its nowhere near finished i can point you to a number of third party studies or publicly available information that looks at penetration rates in western markets and then penetration rates in emerging markets the various content and semiconductor content per vehicle a lot of the big brokerage firms have pretty good materials on this we certainly dont have anything better from a research perspective but i would encourage you to look at that and all of them basically say weve got plenty of room to go in automotive because these trends are accelerating not decelerating arthur winston my next question isnt that important but i want to ask it anyway it seems like the preponderance of your profits now are coming out of europe and you really dont pay any taxes and im wondering well your tax loss carryforwards really wont be worth that much because youll have to pay taxes from all this european business that youre doing anthony ambrose well i just want to for the record say we do pay our taxes we pay them on time and all the taxing jurisdictions that are familiar with us make sure that thats the case the goal is to be smart for the business and then be smart for the taxation strategy and joel does a good job on that i dont know joel do you want to have any other specific comments i dont want to get into joel hatlen yes no art the big thing is that weve managed our business to have the ip and the manufacturing profits in china and the united states where we have some really good tax attribute things to deal with and so the only part that really gets taxed in europe is the distribution related profits there so from that standpoint weve been able to really manage to achieve a much lower tax rate on our european business than we have at other places so otherwise yes arthur winston excellent ive one last question is there anything thats not going right here in may of  anthony ambrose art there are lot of things that arent going perfectly and our job is to make that list of things that arent going perfectly smaller and smaller every day operator operator instructions we do have a follow up from robert andersen with penbrook go ahead please robert anderson joel obviously you discussed this but there was a big jump in total operating expenses from  to  so my question is i presume this higher level of operating expenses will pertain for the balance of the year or will it even go higher than the  joel hatlen yes its a variable item so the answer is really that of the  and some thousand increase in spending there is about  to  that is what i call variable cost that are based on the level of our business thats happening and how many are independent variable cost like consultants and things like that are taking place and the rest of that is headcount type additions in rd really operator and we also have a followup from art winston with pilot advisors go ahead please art winston in studying the proxy statement for the annual meeting later this month it would seem like management doesnt own enough stock in relation to what it seems to be an exceptional job that is done and if there is any way that shareholders or even the managers can influence the board to make more stock available to the management it will work out well and its well deserved so thats i guess not a question its an observation or a comment operator and we now have a question from clark lehman with logos partners go ahead please clark lehman hi gentlemen i got to apologize im not familiar with your company but the numbers intrigued me i can understand your renaissance youre talking about the market size and customers can you educate me as to which competitors you guys are most concerned about i dont know any of your competitors anthony ambrose yes what id encourage you to do is we do a pretty detailed job of describing that in the k and we just updated that so thats extremely current i would encourage you to walk through that and if you have any questions give joel and i a call we can clarify anything offline clark lehman so thats the he who must not be named answer okay i will do that operator thank you we have no one else in queue gentlemen please go ahead with any closing remarks anthony ambrose okay thank you very much at
