of elisabeth m congdon ms congdon who was murdered on june   jennifer johnson one of ms congdons two daughters filed a petition with the st louis county court probate division seeking to admit to probate ms congdons last will and testament dated december   and a twopage document disposing of specific items of personal property marjorie congdon leroy caldwell ms congdons other daughter objected to the petition for probate she alleged that ms congdon lacked testamentary capacity that the will was procured by undue influence and that the will had not been properly executed after a trial before the st louis county court probate division the will and accompanying memorandum were admitted to probate on april   the st louis county district court appellate division affirmed the probate courts order mrs caldwell appeals that decision to this court on july   roger caldwell appellants husband was arrested and charged with ms congdons murder approximately two months later four of mrs caldwells seven children filed a petition in the st louis county probate court objecting to the distribution of funds to mrs caldwell the petition alleged a continuing murder investigation into the possible involvement of appellant and sought to prevent her from receiving distributions from the following sources  the estate of ms congdon estate  the living trust of ms congdon created by agreement of september   and amended on july   and december   the living trust  the trust created under the last will and testament of chester a congdon the testamentary trust  the trust created by indenture of august   by chester a congdon the congdon trust appellant petitioned for distribution of her share of the trust funds on september   in response to that petition the trustees of the various trusts petitioned for an order restraining distribution to appellant pending a determination of her involvement in the murder after a brief hearing the judicial officer took the petitions under advisement roger caldwell was convicted of murdering ms congdon on july   three days later appellant was charged with conspiracy and murder and was later indicted on those charges on july   the judicial officer restrained distributions to appellant for up to one year pending a determination of her involvement in ms congdons death appellant was found not guilty in the murder of ms congdon on july   three days later the st louis county probate court terminated the prohibition against distributions to appellant by its order dated july   however the order provided that a restraining order could be reapplied for if a proceeding were commenced pursuant to minnstat §   on july   the trustees petitioned for such a restraining order which was granted on july   in response appellant filed a motion to require the trustees to immediately distribute to her all moneys to which she was entitled and demanded a change of venue in the event of a minnstat §   action an objection to her motion was filed on august   by three of appellants children at that time the children also requested a trial to determine appellants entitlement to distributions the st louis county probate court denied the demand for change of venue on october   mrs caldwell appealed that order to the st louis county district court appellate division on december   the county probate court denied appellants motion for an immediate distribution and once again denied the change of venue the court concluded that a finding in a criminal proceeding that a person is not guilty of participating in the felonious and intentional killing of another does not prohibit a civil proceeding in this court to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the killing was felonious and intentional so as to prevent the person from receiving benefits by reason of the death mrs caldwell appealed this order to the st louis county district court appellate division on october   the appellate division of the st louis county district court issued separate orders affirming the october   and the december   orders we granted appellants petition for permission to appeal the october   decisions on august   appellant initiated a declaratory judgment action in hennepin county district court she sought a declaration that colorado law was determinative of her status as a beneficiary or in the alternative that minnstat §   was unconstitutional the parties made crossmotions for summary judgment and respondents moved to dismiss the action the motion to dismiss was granted pursuant to minnstat §   on august   mrs caldwell appealed the hennepin county district courts dismissal of the declaratory judgment action to this court there are four basic issues in this appeal first whether the st louis county court probate division had proper venue and jurisdiction second whether the st louis county probate division erred by admitting into probate ms congdons december   will third whether pursuant to minnstat §   there should be a civil proceeding to determine appellants right to receive from ms congdons will and various trusts finally whether the statute of limitations prevents respondents from proceeding pursuant to minnstat §    in resolving these issues we must first determine venue and jurisdiction minnstat §   provides the general rule as to venue except as provided in section  every civil action shall be tried in the county in which it was begun unless the place of trial be changed as hereinafter prescribed and when so changed all subsequent papers in the action shall be entitled and filed in the county to which such transfer has been made minnstat §   provides the general rule for the venue of probate estate proceedings a venue for the first informal or formal testacy or appointment proceedings after a decedents death is  in the county where the decedent had his domicile at the time of his death          b venue for all subsequent proceedings within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court is in the place where the initial proceeding occurred unless the initial proceeding has been transferred as provided in section  or c of this section ms congdon was domiciled in st louis county venue for the estate proceeding was properly in that county minnstat §   provides the place of venue for other than estate proceedings as follows a where a proceeding under this chapter could be maintained in more than one place in this state the court in which the proceeding is first commenced has the exclusive right to proceed b if proceedings concerning the same estate protected person conservatee or ward are commenced in more than one court of this state the court in which the proceeding was first commenced shall continue to hear the matter and the other courts shall hold the matter in abeyance until the question of venue is decided and if the ruling court determines that venue is properly in another court it shall transfer the proceeding to the other court appellant asserts that because a minnstat §   action was first commenced in the hennepin county district court declaratory judgment action that court should continue to hear the matter respondents disagree they contend that the st louis county probate court has jurisdiction to resolve the minnstat §   issue in leslie v minneapolis society of fine arts  nwd  minn we considered a jurisdictional conflict between a district court in a declaratory judgment action and a county probate court regarding the distribution of trust proceeds this court stated as a general rule a probate court also has jurisdiction to exercise all incidental powers which are necessary for an effective exercise of those powers committed exclusively to its jurisdiction    perhaps the most interesting example of an incidental power occurred in vesey v vesey  minn   nwd   where we held that a probate court had subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether a decedents death had been feloniously caused by his widow a fact which if proven would preclude her from taking an inheritance under the decedents will the rule which emerges from these cases and others is that probate courts possess superior and general jurisdiction and have implied power to do whatever is reasonably necessary to carry out powers expressly conferred id at  emphasis added footnote omitted we also commented on the probate courts exclusive jurisdiction in vesey v vesey  minn   nwd   in which we stated that since the probate court has exclusive original jurisdiction to adjudicate and determine whether a person qualifies as an heir devisee or legatee who may lawfully take    it follows that the district court is wholly without    jurisdiction             a person cannot be an heir if he has feloniously taken the decedents life it follows that an original adjudication of whether a person is disqualified under the predecessor to §  from inheriting from a decedent on the alleged ground of having feloniously taken the decedents life is a determination of heirship    as such it involves an exercise of original jurisdiction which belongs exclusively to the probate court id at   nwd at  emphasis added in part based on these considerations it is clear that the minnstat §   action should be heard in the st louis county probate court  the second issue we must decide is whether the st louis county probate court erred by admitting the december   will to probate the judicial officer of the st louis county probate court presided over a fourday trial on the validity of the december   will the trial was initiated by appellants allegations that ms congdon lacked testamentary capacity when she executed the will that the will was the subject of undue influence and finally that the will had not been properly executed with regard to appellants first allegation a testator will be found to have testamentary capacity if when making the will the testator understands the nature situation and extent of his property and the claims of others on his bounty or his remembrance and he is able to hold these things in his mind long enough to form a rational judgment concerning them in re estate of healy  minn    nwd    the abovequoted definition of testamentary capacity was explained in in re estate of jenks  minn   nwd   in which we stated that it is the generally recognized rule that testamentary capacity requires only that the testator have capacity to know and understand the nature and extent of his bounty as distinguished from the requirement that he have actual knowledge thereof id at   nwd at  with regard to testamentary capacity there was considerable testimony concerning a stroke ms congdon suffered in  as a result of the stroke the right side of her body was paralyzed and she developed a language difficulty known as aphasia ms congdon suffered from both expressive and receptive aphasia and as result she had difficulty reading would sometimes have trouble understanding what was said to her and had difficulty expressing herself occasionally she confused words saying no when she meant yes and often had difficulty articulating her thoughts notwithstanding the stroke and its related problems there was testimony that ms congdon understood what was said to her and enjoyed conversation there was also considerable testimony that given a careful explanation ms congdon was capable of understanding the will in question there was conflicting testimony regarding ms congdons memory although she never referred to her employees by name and often forgot promises made to charitable organizations ms congdon remembered where specific items of household furniture were purchased remembered the names of her grandchildren remembered street directions and remembered and was able to relate aspects of family history in addition ms congdon frequently played cards and beat most of her opponents upon review of the entire record it is clear that the st louis county court probate divisions decision regarding testamentary capacity is supported by substantial evidence notwithstanding this evidence appellant argues that the trial court erred in several other respects regarding testamentary capacity appellant argues that ms congdon could not possess testamentary capacity because she was the subject of a conservatorship however because testamentary capacity is a less stringent standard than the capacity to contract it is not inconsistent for the subject of a conservatorship to have sufficient capacity to execute a will in re estate of jenks  minn   nwd   similarly there is no merit to appellants argument that the trial court erred by failing to adopt the opinion of the only expert witness testifying on the issue of testamentary capacity expert opinion testimony is not conclusive but is merely evidence to be weighed and considered by the trier of fact sandhofer v abbottnorthwestern hospital  nwd   minn alstores realty inc v state  minn   nwd   we also reject appellants argument that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence a vicarious admission regarding ms congdons mental capacity the record discloses that the statement was not received because it was an admission but because the statement was made in a proceeding the transcript of which was received into evidence appellant agreed to the introduction of the entire transcript and is therefore estopped from arguing that it was inadmissible thus we hold that the trial court did not err in finding that ms congdon had testamentary capacity when she executed her  will appellants second major argument in support of her contention that the will is invalid is that ms congdon was unduly influenced appellants undue influence argument is based on the contention that ms congdon was susceptible to suggestion and did not initiate the preparation of the  will in order to show undue influence the evidence must go beyond suspicion and conjecture and show not only that the influence was in fact exerted but that it was so dominant and controlling of the testators mind that in making the will he ceased to act of his own free volition and became a mere puppet of the wielder of that influence in re estate of pundt  minn    nwd    quoting in re estate of reay  minn    nwd    although it is true that ms congdon was susceptible to suggestion and did not initiate the preparation of her  will there is no evidence to show that the influence was of a degree to dominate and control ms congdons mind consequently ms congdon cannot be said to have been unduly influenced appellant also argues that ms congdons will is defective because ms congdon did not intend the december   instrument to be her last will and testament appellant argues that ms congdon lacked testamentary intent because she was not questioned about the disposition of all her assets the explanation of the will was brief considering the size of her estate and because ms congdon did not clearly indicate that she intended the will to be her last will and testament the dispositive provisions of the  and  wills are nearly identical this obviated the need to question ms congdon with regard to the disposition of all her assets and explains how the will could be summarized within  minutes the evidence is clear that each article was explained to ms congdon when asked if the will comported to her desires she stated yes it did furthermore ms congdon reaffirmed her testamentary intent when she executed a memorandum disposing of personal property appellant has not met the burden of proving that ms congdon lacked testamentary intent in executing the  will appellants final argument with regard to the validity of the will is that the will was invalidly executed the requirements of due execution are set forth in minnstat §   as follows except as provided for writings within section  and wills within section  every will shall be in writing signed by the testator or in the testators name by some other person in the testators presence and by his direction and shall be signed by at least two persons each of whom witnessed either the signing or the testators acknowledgement of the signature or of the will id on its face the will appears to be properly executed appellant points out though that there is conflicting testimony as to who witnessed the will consequently appellant argues that respondents have not made a prima facie case of due execution because there is sufficient testimony that those who witnessed the will were in fact present and did execute the will as witnesses this contention is without merit furthermore ms congdons will was selfproved in compliance with minnstat §   under this statute the use of a selfproved will establishes a prima facie case of due execution upon review of the entire record given the burden of proof and the appropriate scope of review the evidence is sufficient to support the judicial officers decision to admit the december   will to probate  appellant argues that her acquittal in the murder trial of her mother precludes a civil action to determine her entitlement to benefits from the trusts and the estate appellant reasons that minnstat §   requires a criminal conviction rather than a civil determination of a felonious and intentional killing appellant further argues that a second trial is prohibited by double jeopardy collateral estoppel and res judicata at first glance the separate sections of minnstat §   seem to create an ambiguity as to the availability of a separate civil proceeding on one hand section a of §  refers to an heir or devisee who feloniously and intentionally kills thus implying that a criminal conviction is necessary emphasis added see generally travelers insurance co v thompson  minn   nwd   cert denied  us   sct   ledd   on the other hand minnstat § e  provides that in the absence of a conviction the court may determine by a preponderance of evidence whether the killing was felonious and intentional this section authorizes a civil trial in construing minnstat §   our decision in thompson is instructive there a civil action was brought to keep thompson from receiving life insurance proceeds from his wifes death although thompson was convicted of murdering his wife he argued that the conviction was not conclusive proof in the ensuing civil action the thenapplicable statute minn stat §   provided in part that no person who feloniously    takes the life of another shall inherit    or take by devise    one issue in thompson was whether a second civil trial was necessary we concluded that for civil purposes a criminal conviction was conclusive proof of mr thompsons involvement the thompson court relied in part on the proposition that a criminal conviction necessarily establishes that the requirement of a greater degree of proof has been met and because the party bound by it had every opportunity and incentive to litigate the issue id at   nwd at  in the instant case appellant argues the opposite of this proposition contending that failure to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt should be conclusive in a civil proceeding even though there is a lesser degree of proof required in that proceeding when minnstat §   was repealed in  the uniform probate code section presently codified as minnstat §   was adopted in its place that section codifies the thompson holding regarding the conclusiveness of a felony conviction and provides for a civil proceeding in the event of no conviction minn stat § e  the official comments to uniform probate code §  state that a defendant found not guilty in a criminal proceeding may subsequently be found by the probate court to have feloniously and intentionally killed the decedent appellant argues that even if minnstat §   were construed to permit a civil proceeding a second trial would violate the principles of double jeopardy res judicata and collateral estoppel appellant cites numerous cases in which the government after losing its criminal case was prohibited from bringing a civil action to impose a penalty or forfeit property coffey v united states  us   sct   led   lowther v united states  fd  th cir  united states v one  ford fairlane tudor sedan motor no met  fd  th cir  united states v gully  fd  sdny  in state v enebak  nwd   minn this court stated it is well established that the prohibition against double jeopardy does not preclude separate civil and criminal proceedings based on the same incident see also yates v united states  us   sct   ledd   appellant quotes extensively from coffey and argues that coffey and its progeny make it clear that a civil trial should be barred by res judicata however appellant fails to quote the following portion of the coffey opinion when an acquittal in a criminal prosecution in behalf of the government is pleaded or offered in evidence by the same defendant in an action against him by an individual the rule does not apply for the reason that the parties are not the same     us at   sct at  emphasis added moreover the different degree of the burden of proof between criminal and civil cases also precludes application of the doctrine of res judicata see united states v national association of real estate boards  us    sct    led   burns v united states  fd  th cir  mcduffie v aetna life insurance co  fsupp  edmich affd  fd  th cir  in both mcduffie and burns an acquittal did not bar a subsequent civil action to determine whether the accused was entitled to life insurance proceeds appellant further argues that respondents are collaterally estopped from bringing a minnstat §   proceeding in travelers insurance co v thompson  minn    nwd    cert denied  us   sct   ledd   this court defined collateral estoppel as a form of res judicata whereby a former judgment is conclusive in a later suit between the same parties or their privies respondents in the instant case were not parties in the criminal case for this reason respondents are not collaterally estopped from raising issues determined in appellants criminal trial we therefore hold that a civil proceeding is proper to determine appellants entitlement to receive from the various trusts and to inherit under ms congdons will although this result may seem unduly harsh at first blush that conclusion is compelled by the statutory language the case law and the comments to the uniform probate code appellant attempts to avoid the application of minnstat §   by arguing that colorado law controls the effect of a homicide on beneficiary succession minnstat §   establishes the territorial application of minnesota probate code chapters  and  that statute provides except as otherwise provided in chapter  chapters  and  apply to  the affairs and estates of decedents missing persons and persons to be protected domiciled in this state and  the property of nonresident decedents located in this state or property coming into the control of a fiduciary who is subject to the laws of this state minnstat §   establishes the subject matter jurisdiction of the probate courts as follows a to the full extent permitted by the constitution the court has jurisdiction over all subject matter relating to estates of decedents including construction of wills and determination of heirs and successors of decedents b the court has full power to make orders judgments and decrees and take all other action necessary and proper to administer justice in the matters which come before it ms congdon was domiciled in this state therefore minnesota probate law including minnstat §   applies to her estate appellant argues that even if minn stat §   were applicable that statute should not control because ms congdons estate is not at issue instead appellant contends that the central issue is appellants status as a beneficiary appellant asserts that her status as a beneficiary is determined by the law of her domicile colorado in milkovich v saari  minn    nwd    this court adopted a method for resolving conflict of laws questions the analysis involves the following choiceinfluencing considerations  predictability of result  maintenance of interstate and international order  simplification of the judicial task  advancement of the forums governmental interest  application of the better rule of law in applying these factors including the application of the uniform probate code — which is the law in a majority of jurisdictions — we hold that minnesota law applies  appellant also contends that the statute of limitations bars respondents from bringing a minnstat §   action and concurrently that such proceedings are prohibited since they were not initiated within the deadline ordered by the probate court whether the two or sixyear statute of limitations applies seems immaterial since the proper actions were brought well within any time limits involved the record discloses that minnstat §   was raised in both the petition of the children filed on september   and the petition of the trustees filed on november   the further contention that said proceedings are barred by failing to come within the deadline set by the probate court also is unpersuasive as already noted on july   the probate court restrained the trustees from making distributions to appellant until her involvement in the homicide was determined the court provided that such prohibition shall remain until the determination is made but not more than one year from the date hereof unless a prior order of this court extending the prohibition is obtained it is this provision that provides the basis for appellants argument on july   the county probate court terminated the restraint but provided that petitioners could reapply for relief in the event of §  proceedings on july   the trustees petitioned for an order restraining distributions pending a civil determination on july   such an order was granted in light of this procedural history appellants argument has no merit since the july   order came within one year of the july   order the final procedural consideration is appellants assertion that she has a right to a jury trial to determine if she feloniously and intentionally killed ms congdon minnstat §   provides a if duly demanded a party is entitled to trial by jury in any proceeding in which any controverted question of fact arises as to which any party has a constitutional right to trial by jury b if there is no right to trial by jury under subsection a or the right is waived the court in its discretion may call a jury to decide any issue of fact in which case the verdict is advisory only id emphasis added the constitutional right to a jury trial finds its origin in article  section  of the minnesota constitution the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate and shall extend to all cases at law without regard to the amount in controversy in rognrud v zubert  minn   nwd   this court interpreted that constitutional provision as follows we have often held that the only actions in which minnconst art  §    guarantees the right to a jury trial are those which were conceived of as legal so that such a right existed with respect to them at the time the minnesota constitution was adopted id at   nwd at  proceedings pursuant to minnstat §   did not exist at the time the minnesota constitution was adopted there was no such remedy until  when the statutory predecessor of minnstat §   was adopted see act of mar   ch  §   minnlaws   current version at minnstat §   for this reason appellant does not have a right to a jury trial we therefore affirm the april   and the october   orders of the st louis county district court appellate division and the august   dismissal of the hennepin county district court declaratory judgment action affirmed todd justice concurring specially i agree with the result reached by the majority opinion but i am troubled by the action taken by the trustees in this case as noted in the majority opinion the trustees of the various trusts in this case petitioned the court for an order restraining distribution until the question of marjorie caldwells involvement in the congdon murder was resolved i do not believe that the trustees acted properly when they filed this petition we said in in re great northern iron ore properties  nwd   minn cert denied  us   sct   ledd   that it is fundamental trust law that trustees are under a legal duty to manage the trust with equal consideration for the interests of all beneficiaries thus as between the beneficiaries the trustees must act as neutral stakeholders unless the trust instruments require them to do otherwise bringing a petition to prevent distribution of the trust proceeds to one of the beneficiaries is not a neutral action in in re estate of nelson  minn   nw   we stated that an administratrix of an estate had no standing to challenge a distribution order reasoning a mere stakeholder or one whose duty it is simply to safeguard the funds of the estate has no interest in the decree of distribution other than to turn over to the beneficiaries named therein the funds in his hands and cannot at the expense of the estate take part in controversies arising between claimants id at   nw at  this same principle is generally applicable to trustees see  a scott the law of trusts §  at   therefore i do not believe that the trustees should have petitioned for an order restraining distribution they also should not participate in any future disputes between the beneficiaries yetka justice concurring specially i join in the special concurrence of mr justice todd footnotes  minnstat §   allows items of personal property to be disposed of by a separate written memorandum  this court granted discretionary review pursuant to minnrcivappp   the children joining in the september   petition were peter t leroy suzanne c leroy rebecca w leroy and heather m leroy  notwithstanding the restraining order the judicial officer authorized the trustees of the living trust to distribute a total of  per month to appellant and her son richard w leroy and a total of  per month for the benefit of appellants other children  minnstat §   provides in part a a surviving spouse heir or devisee who feloniously and intentionally kills the decedent is not entitled to any benefits under the will or under this article and the estate of decedent passes as if the killer had predeceased the decedent property appointed by the will of the decedent to or for the benefit of the killer passes as if the killer had predeceased the decedent       d any other acquisition of property or interest by the killer shall be treated in accordance with the principles of this section e a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing is conclusive for purposes of this section in the absence of a conviction of felonious and intentional killing the court may determine by a preponderance of evidence whether the killing was felonious and intentional for purposes of this section  minnstat §   provides as follows the court may refuse to render or enter a declaratory judgment or decree where such judgment or decree if rendered or entered would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding  the probate court sat without a jury in such cases the scope of this courts review is established by minnrcivp  which provides in part findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses this court has stated that a trial courts findings are clearly erroneous only if the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed in re estate of balafas  minn    nwd    see also in re estate of lea  minn   nwd    the burden of proof in contested will cases is set forth in minnstat §   that statute states in contested cases petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death venue and heirship proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases and if they are also petitioners prima facie proof of death and venue contestants of a will have the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity undue influence fraud duress mistake or revocation parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof respondents therefore have the burden of making a prima facie showing that the will was properly executed appellant has the burden of proving undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity  in an attempt to show that ms congdon lacked testamentary capacity appellant introduced evidence regarding a  lawsuit brought by the american state bank of bloomington on a note signed by ms congdon and appellant ms congdons attorney defended the action by arguing that ms congdons signature was obtained by undue influence and that she lacked capacity to enter into the contract however ms congdons attorney stated that he dropped the lackofcapacity defense after obtaining information about ms congdons mental state from her personal physician the lawsuit was settled a similar lawsuit was brought by the marquette national bank of minneapolis on a note signed by appellant and guaranteed by ms congdon this action was also settled the settlement agreement which appellant signed recited that the guarantee was obtained by false pretense and false representation  appellant cites several cases which she contends require a finding that ms congdon lacked testamentary capacity for example appellant argues that in in re estate of healy  minn   nwd   the existence of arteriosclerosis and senile dementia alone prevented the proponents of a will from carrying the burden of proof however in healy this court indicated that since there was evidence which could support a finding either way the trial courts decision would not be reversed each of the cases cited by appellant made reference to a specific condition only for the purpose of providing an evidentiary basis on which to affirm the trial court see also in re estate of palmer  minn   nwd   in re estate of dahn  minn   nw    in addition the trial court properly received into evidence lay opinion testimony regarding testamentary capacity see in re estate of palmer  minn   nwd    the preparation of the  will was initiated by the recommendation of william van evera and tom congdon the conservators of ms congdons estate neither stood to gain from the proposed changes to ms congdons will their primary concern was the possibility that the brule property a retreat located on a river in wisconsin could fall into the hands of mrs caldwells creditors it was proposed that the will be changed so that the brule property could be placed in trust for the benefit of appellants children and thus be protected from appellants creditors ms congdon agreed to this change the conservators retained joseph b johnson to review ms congdons will and together with the conservators mr johnson recommended that the will also be changed to reflect the congdon living trust which was established after the  will to allow ms congdon greater flexibility in disposing of personal property by memorandum and to increase the size of two bequests to employees of ms congdon upon meeting with mr johnson ms congdon agreed that the bequests should be increased and established the amounts of the increase  we find no merit in appellants argument that she had a vested interest in the applicable trusts even before ms congdons death and therefore proceeds from the trusts are not subject to minnstat §   under the terms of each of the trusts appellants remainder interest was not vested but was contingent on appellants surviving ms congdon  the state never claimed in the criminal action against appellant that appellant did the physical act of killing the states charge was based upon minnst §  subd   feloniously as used in the statute is intended in its historic sense and indicates that the criminal law concept as expressed in minn stat §  subd   shall apply a person is criminally liable for a crime committed by another if he intentionally aids advises hires counsels or conspires with or otherwise procures the other to commit the crime the state failed to prove its criminal case against appellant as reflected by the jury verdict of not guilty  the north dakota supreme court has interpreted feloniously in an identical statute as not implying that a criminal felony conviction is necessary see in re estate of josephson  nwd  nd  minnstat §   was repealed by act of june   ch  §   minn laws    the uniform probate code comments to §  provide in part as follows at first it may appear that the matter dealt with is criminal in nature and not a proper matter for probate courts however the concept that a wrongdoer may not profit by his own wrong is a civil concept and the probate court is the proper forum to determine the effect of killing on succession to property of the decedent there are numerous situations where the same conduct gives rise to both criminal and civil consequences a killing may result in criminal prosecution for murder and civil litigation by the murdered persons family under wrongful death statutes while conviction in the criminal prosecution under this section is treated as conclusive on the matter of succession to the murdered persons property acquittal does not have the same consequences this is because different considerations as well as a different burden of proof enter into the finding of guilty in the criminal prosecution hence it is possible that the defendant on a murder charge may be found not guilty and acquitted but if the same person claims as an heir or devisee of the decedent he may in the probate court be found to have feloniously and intentionally killed the decedent and thus be barred under this section from sharing in the estate an analogy exists in the tax field where a taxpayer may be acquitted of tax fraud in a criminal prosecution but found to have committed the fraud in a civil proceeding in many of the cases arising under this section there may be no criminal prosecution because the murderer has committed suicide uniform probate code §  comments emphasis added  the prohibition against double jeopardy finds its origin in both the minnesota and united states constitutions minnconst art i §  provides in part no person shall be put twice in jeopardy of punishment

mansion a night nurse velma pietila was bludgeoned to death with a candlestick holder on the mansions grand staircase police alleged it was a crime of greed saying marjorie caldwell and her new husband roger caldwell were desperate for money and wanted to speed up their  million inheritance roger caldwell was convicted and eventually confessed but a jury found marjorie not guilty of charges that she planned the murders after her acquittal though she spent  years in prison for arson in minnesota and arizona has been charged with bigamy and fraud and was associated with other mysterious deathsi wrote a comprehensive take on the complex case for the current artful living magazine and a firstperson story for the star tribune about my long journey covering roger and marjorie caldwell   in  i was a rookie reporter and stumbled on the case in duluth the day of the murders but i have an alibi and have covered it ever since preparing for the anniversary stories i reached out to jennifer johnson and her family but they declined to comment on the record over the past months but i received a note from her son saying johnson died last month in chandler arizona where she moved after spending her adult years in racine wisconsin she died of natural causes said her son thomas johnson of racinejohnsons husband charles died in  i  kept in contact with the couple over the years letting them know when a story about marjorie would be in the paper they had theories on the case thinking that a second person was with caldwell in the mansion the night of the murders they tried unsuccessfully to get roger caldwell to tell the whole story about that fateful night but he committed suicide in  without divulging more than a rambling vague confession of the murderscreative
