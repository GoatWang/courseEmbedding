commodities and emerging markets funds with currency hedging advantages of asset allocation there is no single investment principle that has more impact on a portfolio‘s performance than proper and balanced allocation among different asset classes investing across stocks bonds and cash—your asset allocation—is one of the keys to longterm success therefore when you select an advisor or investment consultant ask for their independently verified performance numbers in order to help determine their asset allocation track record many institutional investors delegate discretion to a fiduciary investment consultant for asset allocation manager selection and manager due diligence ckw is positioned to be responsible and accountable for its own asset allocation advice and implementation there are many investment vehicles at different costs that access both equity stocks and fixed income bonds ckw currently uses low cost etfs and mutual funds to capture the best ”net of fee“ rate of return for our client‘s asset allocation broad based etfs also reduce manager interaction risk producing and allowing intended allocations to capture incremental returns over time minimizing risk while maximizing return is any investor’s prime goal asset allocation is an excellent tool for managing volatility of investments and controlling risks while two of the principals who act as the portfolio managers received their cima certification at wharton one of them also taught “asset allocation manager selection and due diligence” as an adjunct professor for imcas cima certification at the

midweek staff on july   at  am by carl choy principal of ckw financial group the inaugural edition of the financial times  top registered investment advisors june   issue begins by asking what makes a top quality adviser with a methodology that includes assets under management growth rate compliance record industry certifications and online accessibility the question that follows is “why publish this now” mwbrtcarlchoy ◄ back next ► picture  of  carl choy as baby boomers retire and the financial landscape becomes increasingly complicated the demand for topquality advice has accelerated that trend has helped to propel the growth of the segment of the investment industry that by definition makes their living selling advice registered investment advisors or rias one indication of how the ria sector has grown is that they now sell more in combined mutual fund and exchange traded fund assets than the big four brokerages while many financial advisers in big brokerages have evolved to where they now spend more time providing advice than carrying out “buy” and “sell” transactions rias always have been advisers first as a group rias have shown tremendous growth in the past  years and a large part of that stems from advances in technology which allow a small office to offer the same financial reporting tax accounting and market analysis as the big brokerages ckw financial group is honored to be the only ria firm from hawaii on the top  list ckw’s mission always has been to help good people and institutions be financially better and we continue to take a holistic approach to managing investments toward achieving clients’ goals while we value tradition in proven practices we also believe in the strength and necessity of innovation — finding new solutions using the latest technology as a ria we have the freedom to research select invest and trade anywhere unbound by corporate institutional and market parameters in that way we are able to act in the best financial interests of our clients in addition we operate as a fiduciary and take full fiduciary responsibility in writing for financial advice we provide thanks to our clients’ faith and confidence in us we
