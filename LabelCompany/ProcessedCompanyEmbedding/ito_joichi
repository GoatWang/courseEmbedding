innovation the availability of opensource software and the low cost of communications and collaboration technologies have made silicon valleylike innovation less risky for large established companies on march   when entrepreneur and venture capitalist joi ito was interviewing for his current job as director of the mit media lab an earthquake and tsunami rocked his birth country of japan seeking accurate and trustworthy information about the  magnitude quake and its impact on the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant ito tapped the power of the internet and organized dozens of friends colleagues and strangers online members of the skunkworks group pooled their skills using opensource software hardware and other components they built and deployed more than  geiger counters to detect the amount of radiation exposure from the damaged power plant volunteers in japan installed the devices on cars and drove around the country collecting data over the last five years the counters have gathered  million data points creating according to ito’s estimate the largest open data set in the world “when we undertook this effort government officials criticized us saying ‘you’re amateurs what do you know about nuclear emissions’ but we ended up beating every government agency and nongovernmental organization in terms of the volume and quality of our work and we did it with very little money—about  in funding from the knight foundation a kickstarter campaign and individual donors” says ito “many of the scientists who initially questioned us later wanted to collaborate” this effort which grew into the opencitizen science initiative safecast exemplifies what ito calls an engineeringdriven innovation model in which individuals with a desire to build something can do so relatively quickly and easily by capitalizing on free and opensource software and lowcost communication and collaboration technologies ito says this innovation model appears repeatedly in the consumer internet space and is moving into the manufacturing and industrial internet sectors as well the engineeringdriven innovation model contrasts with the mbadriven approach many large established companies use in which according to ito innovation teams write proposals and make presentations in order to get permission and funding he understands big companies take a more conservative approach because the level of risk is so much higher than for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists “in big companies you worry about downside you might exceed your budget the market might flip over” he says “in contrast i have no fear when i invest money in a company because the top two performing organizations in my portfolio are each worth more than the rest of the portfolio combined this approach allows me to amplify winners and write off losers that’s very different from the circumstances in large companies” given the low cost of innovation today the risk is lower than big companies realize for that reason ito believes companies should reconsider their attachment to the mbadriven approach to innovation and embrace the engineeringdriven model ito points out that engineeringdriven innovation is transforming smaller factories in shenzhen china and urges american manufacturers to take note he says the entrepreneurial mindset and passion for learning among factory workers in shenzen have given them the ability to move seamlessly from say textile manufacturing to electronics and has led some to develop new smartphones one factory worker developed a phone that retails for  with many of the features—including an oled screen lithium battery mp player and sms texting capability—consumers expect from highend products “these workers are literally sitting on the factory floor designing prototypes” says ito “their motto is ‘if you don’t have tooling grease under your fingernails you’re not a real designer’ they’re a force to be reckoned with you don’t get this kind of innovation when a designer and manufacturing engineer have to exchange powerpoint presentations” the next major innovation ito urges executives to watch is synthetic biology in which principles and practices from biology and engineering are combined to redesign existing biological components and systems and even fabricate new ones dupont’s sorona® biopolymer fiber is an example—ito says it’s now created using a microbe that converts amino acids and sugars to fabric materials  percent more efficiently than traditional manufacturing methods in other areas of synthetic biology engineers are “reprogramming” bacteria to produce a range of products including biofuels and arsenic sensors while ito is enthusiastic about synthetic biology he sounds a warning about one area of innovation currently garnering much attention the blockchain he believes the distributed ledger technology will reinvent many aspects of financial services but the billion dollars’ worth of venture money flowing into the space has put the industry “ahead of its skis” and led to the creation of some unreasonably aggressive or poorly designed businesses he urges developers to focus on the stability security and fundamental theory behind the technology and to proceed with caution “in the past if you wanted to develop a new product or service from the bottom up it would have cost millions to billions of dollars” says ito “now the cost of innovation is so low that you no longer need money as much as you need capabilities”   related content “a qa with mit media lab director joi ito” “inside the mit media lab big data privacy

joi mar     utc » categories gadgets  mindfulness i currently have to deal with five hours or so of email a day and each day is packed with meetings many as short as  minutes and  hour meetings being booked only in extraordinary circumstances i have a list of  or so names of people that ive promised to meet many who are very angry because we havent been able to even book a meeting on my calendar i aggressively turn down all kinds of request and am aggressively resigning from boards and other obligations but each day i receive a steady flow of meeting requests that i just cant turn down ive chosen this path and im not complaining about the fact that im busy my concern at the moment is that the urgency and the rate of inbound email requires that in addition to the  hours of email in the morning and the  hours of email in the evening i must diligently triage email during the day right now depending on how much of my attention is required in a meeting i keep an eye on my email and direct partial attention to my device and not my meeting as someone who ironically coteaches a class on awareness i realize that this is both rude and a very poor way to have an effective meeting people who know me well have gotten used to it but for many people its disconcerting and disappointing ive thought about what i can do about this the obvious answer is to try to check email between meetings but that would mean that i would have to reduce the number of meetings since my meetings are so short i could also ignore more of my email im already unable to respond to many important email requests and reducing my responsiveness in email would also cause harm at some level this is just a matter of being completely overcommitted and i am doing my best to try to deal with that but i was wondering if there might be some clever way to deal with the partial attention during meetings problem one idea that i had was to schedule several hours of email time during the day interspersed with no devices  full attention meeting times when someone signed up for a meeting we would ask if they needed full attention and if so they would end up in the full attention slot queue or get booked a month or so out when my next full attention slot was available on the other hand if all they wanted was for me to be available to provide opinions or make decisions as part of a broader meeting or if the person didnt mind my partial attention during meetings we could book the meeting in a partial attention slot which could be scheduled sooner i would use unbooked partial attention slots to catch up on email if no one wanted such a slot this feels a bit too clever by half and maybe difficult to communicate to a person not familiar with my problem the other idea that i had was just to ask at the beginning of a meeting do you want this to be a laptops closed meeting or do you mind if i keep my eye on urgent email and triage im not sure if everyone would ask for my full attention or if id have a selection bias where only people confident enough would ask for my full attention and that those people who really needed my attention but were too polite would end up with my partial attention lastly i could just be a bit more mindful in the meetings and try to read the room better i am generally pretty good at figuring out when the meeting requires my full attention but as anyone who has seen someone trying to do this knows one probably thinks they are doing this better than they actually are and in any case it appears disrespectful to anyone who isnt used to people in this mode any suggestions any thoughts on my crazy ideas i know many of you will say youre just overcommitted just say no to more stuff ok i will and i am but i think i will still have some variant of this problem even if im just replying to earnest questions from students that i think deserve some sort of response  comments  trackback book talk at the harvard book store about whiplash with coauthor jeff howe »

inflexible and time consuming corporations often worried about the substantial risks involved in their investments and developments without constant feedback end products risked misalignment with market needs in this environment large corporations often felt reluctant to make new adjustments because they wanted returns on their initial investments instead of providing optimal products or services in ai life is fastpaced information is complex and knowledge is disseminated from the bottom up in joichi’s own words the theme of ai is “anarchic” rapid connectivity empowers people to share organize and act quickly to the degree that no single entity governments corporations or individuals can fully control the accesses to knowledge and information in fact opensource or opencontent formats have forced businesses to adapt bottomup designs and provide competitive pricing since the capacity of information technology doubles roughly every two years according to moore’s law the cost of innovation has gone down drastically  new world new attitude  new approach open and lowcost innovation equals opportunities joichi encourages individuals to take risks and to become entrepreneurs when i asked if that includes dropping out before finishing a degree he clarified that he didn’t encourage students to drop out of college — but to embrace risktaking afterwards however he repeatedly emphasized the difference between theory and practice ai our turbulent era is inherently fast paced and unpredictable one cannot afford to theorize their ideas and hope for the market to follow

idea at the very first try and they simply need to stay flexible and keep trying joichi also touched on the connection between needs and services in the business world products and services need to address creativity and locality he gave an example about detroit local residents do not welcome corporations who romanticize the region making big changes without engaging the communities applying the same concept to governance a group of concerned individuals who did not have any disaster experience prior to the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster did better jobs than the japanese government they achieved success by driving a car around to collect radiation data and provide constructive assistance to the victims  future opportunity d printing is the next big thing d printing encourages customization and creative expression it will manifest the trend of “selflearning” in the information age with d printing hardware startups can act similarly to internet startups the ability to fabricate designs on site will permit low production and innovation costs while allowing a high level of creative customization for ito the bottom line of the future is think big write your own rules design your own things and print your own stuff  principles let’s summarize joichi’s wisdom with his  principles disobedience over compliance learn the system and find ways to innovate beyond it emerge over authority do not let the authority or norms to limit your potential and creativity practice over theory build first theory later build prototypes first draft business plans later resilience over strength test and fail quickly to understand the market then make new adjustments accordingly risk over safety do not let overprotection take away your learning opportunities pull over
