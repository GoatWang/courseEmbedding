myriad of woodworking tasks including serving as a table saw drill press boring machine disc sander and many others when attachments are used   specifically she alleges that on september   as she passed by the machine which jefferson david huff was operating her shirt became entangled in the saw blade which lacked a protective guard   huffs right arm was immediately pulled into the machine causing severe injury¶  jefferson david huff purchased the shopsmith mark v in  at the estate sale of dr tom b dominick   dr dominick originally purchased the piece of equipment around    the mark v dr dominick bought was manufactured by magna american corporation in raymond mississippi and sold by montgomery ward incorporated   magna dissolved in  and montgomery ward filed for chapter  protection under the united states bankruptcy code this unfortunate chain of events left huff without direct parties to sue   how shopsmith became a party to the suit is the true basis for this appeal¶  originally the shopsmith mark v was manufactured by magna engineering corporation who later sold the product line to magna american corporation “magna”   magna continued making and selling the mark v until  when it ceased all production of woodworking power tools¶  in early  john folkerth began negotiations to purchase some of magnas assets in order to reinitiate production of their woodworking power tools line   folkerth had no previous connection to magna or magna engineering aside from an admiration of their products   the negotiations led to the execution of an option agreement which gave folkerth the option to buy the equipment inventory patents and other property necessary to resume production of magnas line of power tools   included within this agreement were the mark v trademarks and customer lists¶  in  folkerth assigned all of his rights under the agreement to shopsmith a newly formed ohio corporation   shopsmith entered into a supplemental agreement with magna which resulted in shopsmiths acquiring the necessary assets to begin production of the woodworking power tool line   under this supplemental agreement magna received no stock nor interest in shopsmith and both sides were represented by counsel   the necessary physical assets were subsequently shipped from mississippi to shopsmiths factory in ohio at no time were members of management or other employees of magna holders of any stock or otherwise associated with shopsmith   since the agreement in  shopsmith has been the sole manufacturer of mark vs and magna remained in business until voluntary dissolution in discussion ¶  when reviewing the granting of summary judgment we apply the de novo standard of review  mccullough v cook  sod   miss   thus we sit in the same position as did the trial court   as such in order to affirm the granting of summary judgment we must decide that “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law”  miss r civ p ci whether the “product line” theory should be adopted holding a successor corporation strictly liable for the torts of its predecessor ¶  huff urges us to adopt the “product line” theory of products liability so that a successor corporation may be held liable for injuries caused by defective products manufactured by its predecessor corporation   the theory was originally put forth by the california supreme court in ray v alad corp  cald   calrptr   pd   and has since been adopted by several other states ¶    the general rule has been that a corporation which acquires all of the assets but no stock of another corporation does not also acquire the debts and liabilities of the original  mozingo v correct mfg corp  fd   th cir however under the product line theory successor corporations which undertake the manufacture of the same products as the predecessor are liable for injuries caused by defects in that product and inherit the liabilities associated with the product even if sold and manufactured by the predecessor corporation  ramirez v amsted indus inc  nj   ad      under the product line theory manufacturers both predecessor and successor corporations are in a better position to insure against defective products and the compensation of innocent victims is spread throughout society  hickman v thomas c thompson co  fsupp   dcolo ¶    there is one significant hurdle to traverse before the merits of the products line theory may be properly considered   shopsmith argues that the product line theory has been found applicable only in states where strict liability is still a valid theory of recovery and that mississippis adoption of misscode ann §  supp is an abandonment of strict products liability   shopsmith misinterpreted the holding of the trial court or at the least takes it a step too far   with the adoption of §  common law strict liability as laid out in state stove mfg co v hodges  sod  miss is no longer the authority on the necessary elements of a products liability action   however the concept of strict liability is still quite alive within the statute and the principles in state stove are a driving force in products liability actions even after adoption of the statute  wolf v stanley works  sod   missctapp   whether an action is labeled “statutory products liability” or “strict liability” matters little since the basic precepts are largely the same ¶    even under the product line theory certain elements must be present to subject a successor corporation to liability for the products of a predecessor   the successor must produce the same product under a similar name have acquired substantially all of the predecessors assets leaving no more than a corporate shell hold itself out to the public as a mere continuation of the predecessor and benefit from the good will of the predecessor  ray  calrptr   pd at ¶    there is no question that shopsmith produces the same product as did magna and the name remains unchanged   although shopsmith argues to the contrary there is also little doubt that shopsmith benefitted from the good will of magna   through various advertising media shopsmith often points to the reliability craftsmanship and longevity of the mark v ¶    a problem arises as to the other two necessary elements   although shopsmith makes references that the mark v has been around since  the corporation also makes clear that it was not the inventor nor original manufacturer of the mark v in fact the shopsmith web page http wwwshopsmithcom tells the long and involved story of how it came to make the mark v there is no definitive evidence that shopsmith holds itself out to the public as a mere continuation of magna magna engineering or any other corporation   as for the final requirement when shopsmith acquired magnas assets it did not acquire substantially all of them and certainly did not leave magna a mere corporate shell   shopsmith acquired only the power tools aspect of magnas enormous enterprise   magna remained a viable corporate entity for nearly  years after the agreement with shopsmith   therefore even though we view the product line theory as a viable basis for recovery the present situation does not meet the standards utilized by other courts that have adopted the theoryii whether there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether shopsmith expressly andor impliedly agreed to assume the liabilities of its predecessor ¶    traditionally only four exceptions to the general rule against successor liability have been recognized under mississippi law when the successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the liabilities of the predecessor when the transaction may be considered a de facto merger when the successor may be considered a “mere continuation” of the predecessor  or when the transaction was fraudulentrussell v sunamerica securities inc  fd   th cir  mozingo  fd at    shopsmith asserts that it does not fit within any of these exceptions ¶    huff alleges that certain clauses and language contained within the original option purchase agreement indicate that the parties contemplated that shopsmith may be liable to a third party   as such huff asserts that there is a genuine question whether shopsmith expressly andor impliedly agreed to assume the liabilities of magna   it is worthy to note that folkerth was the original party to this agreement and that shopsmith later purchased it from him   huff is essentially arguing that the “hold harmless” clause as an agreement for magna to indemnify shopsmith for any liabilities incurred upon its behalf is evidence of an assumption of liability by shopsmith   shopsmith rebuts this contention by pointing out that there is no consent by it in the option agreement to assuming magnas liabilities and that the purpose of the “hold harmless” clause is to indemnify it against losses not the other way around   huffs allegation is not well founded and is rejected ¶    in addition to assumption of liability a successor corporation may be imputed with the predecessors liabilities if evidence suggests there was a de facto merger of the two corporations  mozingo  fd at    a de facto merger exists when there is a continuity of management personnel assets and operations  a continuity of shareholders  the predecessor dissolves shortly thereafter  and the successor assumes the predecessors obligations  hadar v concordia yacht builders inc  fsupp   sdny  ths northstar assocs v wr grace  coconn  fsupp   dminn   the present situation does not fit this scheme   shopsmith and magna never merged   instead they remained two separate viable corporate entities for years following the purchase of assets ¶    although huff asserts that shopsmith falls within the third exception we have seen that the situation does not fulfill the requirements of the traditional rule or product line theory   thus the allegation that the shopsmithmagna agreement constitutes a “mere continuation” of the original enterprise is without merit and does not subject shopsmith to the liabilities of magna ¶    finally there is no evidence and huff does not allege that the transaction was fraudulent   all of the circumstances indicate that this was a legitimate business transaction where both sides were represented by counsel   there exists absolutely nothing to suggest that magna was somehow trying to avoid liability nor any other illegal motive   thus this case does not fall within any of the previously recognized exceptionsiii whether huff should be allowed to proceed on its failure to warn claim ¶    notwithstanding our decision as to the product line theory huff asserts that the summary judgment should be reversed and she should be allowed to proceed with her failure to warn claim   huff points out that several courts which normally follow the traditional rule of nonliability of successor corporations have held that a successor corporation may have an independent duty to warn when defects in the predecessors products come to its attention  leannais v cincinnati inc  fd   th cir  nissen corp v miller  md   ad   n   citing  l frumer  m friedman products liability §  at  rev  “the courts consider the following factors as significant in determining the existence of a relationship effective to create a duty to warn   succession to a predecessors service contract   coverage of the particular machine under the contract   a service of that machine by the purchasercorporation  and  the purchasercorporations knowledge of defects and of the location or owner of that machine”  harris v newman mach co  fsupp   sdmiss   huff asserts a different set of criteria but it is unclear exactly what authority she relies upon in citing her requirements as opposed to those listed in harris   nonetheless the above elements seem to be the most important when trying to prove a duty to warn¶    in the present case shopsmith is not subject to liability for failure to warn of defects in its predecessors products   first shopsmith never expressly agreed to assume magnas service contracts   second there is no evidence that shopsmith ever legally obligated itself to service magna mark vs even though it did undertake to do so on a few occasions   as for contacting owners of the products shopsmith had the right to purchase magnas customer lists but there is no indication that it did so   in the present case contacting the huffs would have been a virtual impossibility   after all dr dominick originally purchased the mark v around  and mr huff did not acquire it until    furthermore mr huff purchased the mark v at an estate saleconclusion ¶    there are four exceptions to the traditional rule that a successor corporation does not acquire the debts and liabilities of a predecessor when acquiring its assets but no stock and shopsmith does not fall within any of these   huff urges us to allow recovery under the product line theory but the facts of this case simply do not conform to the necessary elements allowing such recovery   put simply shopsmith is just too far removed from any wrongdoing to be held liable¶    there also is no material issue as to whether shopsmith expressly or impliedly agreed to assume liability under the purchase option agreement   the remoteness of the parties as well as sheer impracticality support the conclusion that shopsmith did not have a duty to warn   a wholly separate company is not held to the same duties as a predecessor corporation merely because the first purchased some of the latters assets¶    summary judgment was appropriate and the proper outcome was reached   therefore the judgment of the rankin county circuit court is affirmed¶    affirmed¶    i concur with the result in this case and with all of the majority opinion except for its adoption by dicta of the “product line” theory of products liability   the majority states  “therefore even though we view the product line theory as a viable basis for recovery the present situation does not fit the standards utilized by other courts that have adopted the theory”   such a major expansion of our states products liability law should only be done where warranted by the facts and after due and deliberate evaluation and discussion by this courtfootnotes   although not binding upon this court other courts have expressly ruled upon these issues and found that they were without merit   kolar v gc peterson mach co no  dminn  lewman v shopsmith case no c sdohio diaz
