continue reading the main story photo manuela herzer a former lover of the media mogul sumner m redstone going into court in los angeles on friday credit kevork djansezianreuters a former lover of the ailing media mogul sumner m redstone who is waging a legal battle over his mental competency made a lastditch attempt over the weekend to keep her salacious lawsuit alivein a filing on sunday to judge david j cowan of los angeles county superior court lawyers for the woman manuela herzer argued that the court should hear all of the evidence and not dismiss the case as the judge indicated he might do on friday after he heard videotaped testimony from mr redstone a yearold billionaire ms herzer’s legal team outlined two reasons for continuing the trial first the lawyers said the court should not accept mr redstone’s testimony at face value they said the court was “dutybound to look behind the testimony to determine whether redstone’s views are those of a man of a sound mind and whether he came to and has maintained these views absent any undue influence”the lawyers said that the court must hear all of the evidence from ms herzer to determine the answer to those questions advertisement continue reading the main story second they said that aborting the trial after one day and three witnesses would be “a great disservice to redstone’s best interests because if his decisions are the product of mental illness or undue influence the proceedings are not only reasonably necessary but essential to protect him” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story in their own filing on sunday mr redstone’s lawyers appeared to take their lead from judge cowan’s remarks in court on friday when he expressed wariness over the need to wade through what he called the “all of these shenanigans” in the redstone householdthe court “need not preside over a trial regarding the breakdown of mr redstone and ms herzer’s relationship” mr redstone’s lawyers said in their new dismissal motionms herzer filed suit last november claiming that mr redstone lacked the capacity to make the decision to remove her from an advance directive that would have put her in charge of his health care she said she was waging the legal battle out of concern for mr redstone’s wellbeinglawyers for mr redstone said ms herzer was motivated by greed on the same day he removed her from the health care directive he also removed her from his personal estate plan in which he had planned to leave her  million and his  million los angeles mansionthe trial began friday with the minute videotape of testimony from mr redstone who has not been seen publicly for nearly a yearafter viewing the video judge cowan declared that mr redstone had appeared to forcefully reject the notion that ms herzer should be in charge of his health care or a part of his life at all while he said he needed the weekend to consider whether the case should continue judge cowan indicated that mr redstone’s testimony had raised doubts about ms herzer’s position “your burden now is a hard one” he told her legal team after viewing the tapein their filing on sunday ms herzer’s lawyers argued that mr redstone’s vehemence in his testimony may result from “serious cognitive impairment” and manipulation by his daughter shari redstone mr redstone’s outbursts “do not indicate that he had capacity but rather confirm that he lacks” it they argue newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must

said that to terminate the trial without hearing further evidence would risk setting a precedent with “widespread implications” for hospitals lawyers and others involved in elder care “it cannot be that an elderly person — particularly an elderly individual whom everyone agrees is susceptible to undue influence — can simply state what he wants and have that accepted as gospel” the filing said advertisement continue reading the main story mr redstone’s lawyers rejected the suggestion that he was manipulated “of course there is not a scintilla of evidence that mr redstone actually wants ms herzer in his life but was unduly influenced to testify otherwise” the dismissal motion said the redstone team also reiterated a caution it has raised repeatedly that the salacious details being presented by ms herzer’s lawyers are compromising mr redstone’s “privacy and dignity”the possibility of dismissal after one day of testimony opened a path by which mr redstone’s side might quickly prevail in the case but the first day’s harsh testimony and the lurid details in pretrial filings had already subjected the redstone family to acute embarrassment and raised substantial questions about mr redstone’s continued role in his publicly held companiesmr redstone is a director chairman emeritus and controlling shareholder of cbs and viacom two of the world’s largest media companiesthe videotaped testimony presented in court on friday remained confidential but a transcript that was made public showed a fiery yet somewhat feeble man mr redstone repeatedly referred to ms herzer in expletives and said that he did not want her to be in his life or to make health care decisions for him mr redstone responded to some basic questions — especially those that had yes or no responses — but struggled with others when asked what his birth name had been for instance he remained silentyet mr redstone did say that he hated ms herzer when asked about whether he wanted ms herzer to make health care decisions for him he said “no” he said that the wanted his daughter to make health care decisions if he is unable to do so himselfalso on the witness stand was dr stephen l read a psychiatrist testifying for the herzer side who examined mr redstone in late january and said that he lacked decisionmaking capacity and that his “arithmetic was appallingly bad” in one example he said that mr redstone did a poor job when he was presented with a simple array of colored shapes — circles triangles stars and squares — and asked to identify them by pointingin court documents over the last five and half months ms herzer detailed claims about mr redstone’s incontinence demands to eat steak while on a feeding tube and obsession with various lovers in turn lawyers for mr redstone asserted that ms herzer exploited their relationship for financial gain they said that between last august and midoctober a period when ms herzer said she was occupied by taking care of mr redstone’s health care she charged more than  to his american express cardthe legal drama has riveted both hollywood and wall street a decision by the judge that mr redstone was incompetent could set off a contentious succession plan for the two biggest companies in his  billion media empireupon death or if he is deemed incompetent mr redstone’s interests in cbs and viacom are to be held by an irrevocable trust that was created for his five grandchildren among the trust’s seven voting members are ms redstone and philippe p dauman the chief executive of viacom ms redstone and mr dauman have

tough it’s been  and it has been at times i’m turned on by the challenges and i really enjoy what i’m doing also i enjoy the people around me who work at viacom and cbs what movie star do you likeyou’re in dangerous territory right now i’ll tell you what i like all the stars who work for paramount what personal weaknesses do you forgive in someonewell one i cannot forgive is patience patience is a virtue that i do not respect if you’re patient you’ll never go anywhere it takes impatience to drive you to succeed so i can’t forgive that other than that i’m a very forgiving and loving person you know what mandela said “without forgiveness there is no future” people should remember that what personal qualities do you admire in businesscompetence commitment and character however without character forget about competence and commitment are you doing anything green anything for the environmentyes i’m encouraging the exvice president i was president when the paramount documentary won i think all of us are concerned about the environment and i hope the concern results in some action i was watching today a very interesting program on electric cars i drove one a long time ago but they’re far more developed they do help the environment and also relieve the strain on gasoline and oil i’m afraid it’ll take a long time if we keep working at all of these subjects all of these areas we will succeed what was your greatest moment in businessi guess you’d have to say the acquisition of viacom because without viacom there would have been no paramount and there would have been no cbs so i guess the greatest moment would have to be the very difficult battle with and acquisition of viacom what is your dreamkeep living forever keep working forever what is your present state of mindoptimism i’m hopeful i’m confident in the longterm growth of both viacom and cbs i’m optimist about my personal life and i believe that the only philosophy of life that’s compatible with sanity is optimism transcript cnbcwhat do you remember from your years at boston latin sumner redstoneat the boston latin school competition was fierce but what i learned was that the only thing that really counts is competence commitment character what doesn’t count is race religion gender or where your family is it’s competence in the final analysis cnbchow did they instill that in you sumner redstonethey didn’t instill it in me it was a clear observation it was my experience in the competitive environment that was fiercer than anything i experienced in later life including all the battles at viacom and cbs cnbcyou were in fierce competition from an early age sumner redstoneyes from an early age i always wanted to be number one you know i wrote a book called the passion to win i’ve always wanted to win that doesn’t mean i always have or i always will but it’s been my objective throughout my life whether in school or in business cnbcwhat inspired you at an age when a lot of people think their business career is ending to take on something as big as viacom sumner redstonewell first i never will think my business career is ending i expect to live forever and i do everything possible to bring that result about coming back to your question i saw that television was a growth industry that mtv and nickelodeon would travel people were saying mtv was a fad that fad now reaches just a billion people people were saying that nickelodeon would never work because it was a kids’ channel you have to follow your own instincts today nickelodeon’s the number one channel on television so you have to do what your instincts tell you to do and what you intelligence tells you to do but i saw it as growth and i had reservations about whether the motion picture industry would be a growth industry that was what led me to viacom apart from the fact that the management was trying to buy it cheap cnbcyou took on a huge financial risk can you tell us a little bit about that sumner redstonewell yes we sold about everything we had i had acquired a lot of media stocks in those days it meant a great deal because they weren’t part of conglomerates we made some money we borrowed some money as they say we bet the ranch something like five to seven hundred million dollars which is now worth about eight billion cnbcwhat was people’s reaction sumner redstonethey’re reaction was i overpaid mtv would fail it was a fad and who would think that a children’s channel like nickelodeon would ever work i pay a lot of attention to wall street but there are times you have to follow your own judgement and your own instincts that is a time i did not follow wall street cnbchow do you feel about wall street today sumner redstonei think wall street is generally on the ball wall street generally has it right however if you’re talking about the long term growth of companies like viacom and cbs i have to factor in what i think will lead to the long term growth of both companies and the long term growth of the shareholder’s value that’s where i am focused cnbcyou have been running viacom at a time of extraordinary growth do you think it’s still possible to have that kind of growth sumner redstoneyeah absolutely i think both companies have the potential for great growth and the reason i think is mostly this… many years ago i coined the phrase “content is king” and both viacom and cbs are major producers of great content what attracted me about nickelodeon mtv vh comedy central bet and so on are the great programs that cbs has like csi csi miami csi new york two and half men survivor the best news shows  minutes they both are producers of great content and they both are producing new content like in the case of cbs cain which we expect great things from cnbci know that both viacom and cbs are acquiring new distribution outlets how much of your energy is going into content and how much do you have to pay attention to new distribution sumner redstonewell i think they go together obviously although content is king as i say people don’t watch cbs they watch csi they don’t watch viacom they watch mtv so our job is to continue to create the most innovative creative consumerfriendly content at both companies and then see to it that it’s on every platform and at every place on the planet cnbchow do you feel about the dominance of itunes and some of these other distribution channels sumner redstonethey’re all good businesses we have a role in every new business we’ll go anywhere as long as we get paid for it cnbcthe advertising market’s changed a lot before if you ran a program on one of your networks you had a hundred percent of the advertising but now if you’re running it through other distribution venues you’re sharing the advertising how does that affect your businesses sumner redstonewell it’s fine as long as we get the most of the share and what we’re entitled to remember take viacom we spent decades creating that programming and we expect to get paid for it we expect to get paid at a value that’s commensurate with the value of our content if we do we’re glad to see it anywhere cnbchow about the international market sumner redstoneit’s very important to us particularly for the future right now the fastest growing part of mtv is mtv international in a hundred and sixty countries and territories we reach a billion people we intend to keep growing i as philippe says have been planting the viacom flag all over the world which means china europe germany i’ve recently been to germany and turkey i’ve also made my second trip to kuwait and dubai and i’m going back to dubai in the fall cnbccan you talk about usergenerated content sumner redstonethere is a lot of usergenerated content but companies like google are not getting rich on usergenerated content they’re getting rich on the content of companies like viacom and we’re not going to put up with people taking our product and not paying for it they want our product they can have it at the right price cnbcyou had a phrase once “success is built on failure” can you talk about that sumner redstonewhat i said is that success is not built on success not great success great success is built on failure frustration even catastrophe and how you deal with it and how you turn it around that’s what creates success that’s what proves your character cnbcand you’ve had tremendous success but you are facing challenges sumner redstonealways life is a challenge every time you make a strategic move it’s a challenge every time you create new programming it’s a challenge but without challenges there’s no place to go cnbcwhat would you want wall street to know about viacom and cbs right now sumner redstonei’d want them to know a number of things these are great companies they have great assets and most important they have great management there are no managers better than philippe dauman and tom dooley at viacom les moonves at cbs and i’ve always said it’s what management brings to the assets of the company that separates the winners from the losers so that’s why these two companies will be winners we’re focused on creating long term growth operational growth and long term value for the stockholders of both companies cnbchow does the stock price affect your daily outlook sumner redstonewell in a way the stock price is a report card however the report card is not always accurate the report card i’m interested in is not tomorrow’s but the report card of a year from now two years from now three years from now in other words i’m focused on the long term growth of both companies and the long term of operation of the stock cnbcwhat keeps you going what does winning mean to you sumner redstonei think it means what it means to everyone else winning is winning winning is coming out best winning is being in so many frays as i have been at viacom barry diller malone in order to preserve the integrity of your company and the growth of your company you will be involved time after time in battles that you do not want but that you have to win cnbcnot everyone has your drive not everybody has your energy… sumner redstonethey’re unfortunate i’ve always been driven since i was six inches high and i continue to be driven today to the same extent cnbcyou took a huge risk when you risked everything… sumner redstonei believe in taking risks but not in taking reckless risks not in taking irrational risks one has to determine how important the risk is the degree of the risk and how important the reward and the goal is and i think i’ve been able to do that for the most part successfully cnbcall media companies are under a kind of siege now from the internet… sumner redstonei don’t see that at all you have that wrong the internet probably right now accounts for  percent of the operational earnings of our companies now it’s growing but we know how to grow it it’s just another source of revenue advertising revenue for our companies we just have to be able to and we are moving our product to every platform whether it’s the internet whether it’s cell phones whatever and we’ve been successful in doing it we don’t see that as a risk we see it sincerely as an opportunity cnbcis there any particular program you like sumner redstonei like them all i watch cbs and viacom programming a lot i think everybody watches shows like csi and two and a half men and the right generations watch mtv nickelodeon vh bet and so on so i have to love them all cnbcwhen you talk to students what do you talk to them about sumner redstonei talk about the media industry that’s what i’ll be talking about at bu law school i taught at bu law school the law of the entertainment industries and the students seemed very interested i taught about the media industry generally including digital which you touched on many of the things we discussed today i’m thrilled to be there i always enjoy teaching and i always enjoy the interest that the students show cnbcwhat is the entrepreneurial spirit sumner redstoneyou have to begin with a commitment to excellence you have to begin with a philosophy that nothing is impossible you have to have a lot of drive a lot of commitment a lot of competence and maybe some good fortune along the way it takes a lot of ingredients to create a success cnbcyoung people today are interested in starting their own businesses because it’s easier it wasn’t that easy when you started a business now you can really just start a website… sumner redstonethat’s true but i know from experience starting a new business is not easy for anybody it won’t be easy in the future wasn’t easy in the past and don’t expect it to be easy now it’s a tough job cnbcare you particularly concerned about the future sumner redstonewell of course when you spend as many years as i have been in the industry there are times when you’re concerned about something that’s going on like there was a time when blockbuster was a problem but we rescued it and i went and made deals with the studios to share in the revenue but there’s never been a time i was ready to give up i look at everything that may be negative as a challenge to be overcome and that has succeeded so far cnbcdo you think this is a time of greater change sumner redstonei think this industry is exciting because it’s evolutionary it’s always changing sometimes it’s revolutionary but if you stay with those principles you can succeed no matter what the status of the industry static changing fast stay with it cnbcwhen do you watch cnbc sumner redstonefrom the moment i get up in the morning before the market opens i have cnbc on i run a stock buyback program and it’s important that i watch the events that occur as i buy stock cnbcare there any particular programs that you watch the most sumner redstonewell if you have cnbc on you see it all whether it’s squawk box power lunch you see i know what i’m

percent during the latest fiscal quarter the company reported weakness across both its television and film groups with soft tv ratings at some networks declines in domestic advertising sales and the dismal boxoffice performance of its film “teenage mutant ninja turtles out of the shadows”reaching a settlement helps to preserve the privacy and the dignity of mr redstone who has suffered a series

geezer media mogul sumner redstone once gave  million to a flight attendant on the cbs corporate jet — then slept with her sister and doled out  million to that woman legal papers claim the sisters were just part of a stable of at least  women whom the loaded yearold magnate showered with dough says former redstone lover sydney holland  in bombshell court documents filed monday “redstone gave tens of millions of dollars to various other women — who he had no intention of marrying and was not in love with — at the time he was engaged to marry sydney” the los angeles superior court filing says “women who did nothing more than provide sexual favors” redstone’s spurned exlover filed the documents in response to a lawsuit he slapped her with in october accusing her and another exgirlfriend manuela herzer of emotionally abusing him and manipulating him into giving them more than  million worth of gifts over five years “that the complaint only names sydney and herzer as defendants when redstone knows that there were and possibly still are many other women who he gave tens of millions of dollars to during this same time period that he alleges sydney and herzer had ‘total control’ of his life makes no sense” holland’s response reads holland didn’t name names but warned that she “may be forced to” — and that she might even call on the billionaire’s celebrity pals and business associates as witnesses redstone’s generosity included  million for a “an aspiring realityshow producer” and  million along with a job at showtime for a friend of his grandson’s girlfriend holland alleges she hinted that the filthyrich media titan’s sexual predilections weren’t exactly conventional saying in the papers that there were “many other acts committed by redstone and uncomfortable requests he made of sydney that will not be detailed here’’ holland says her illfated love affair with the tycoon began in the fall of  when the couple was set up by patti stanger star of bravo’s “the millionaire matchmaker” redstone’s grandson brandon korff had called holland to arrange the date the court papers say on the pair’s first date they went to dinner at a restaurant then redstone took her back to his beverly hills mansion where he wooed her by showing off his “collection of exotic fish” and giving her a signed copy of his book “a passion to win” the documents say in the ensuing months the couple “took long drives down the malibu coast listening to tony bennett and frank sinatra” the papers say “they went to restaurants and shared redstone’s favorite dessert chocolate mousse” holland says she was soon redstone’s lover caregiver and even interior decorator and personal groomer she lived to make him happy even arranging sunday “movie nights” with his old pals such as charlie rose sherry lansings and mike milken the papers say “for many years sydney had to be home for lunch and dinner with him seven days a week because redstone expected her to be” the papers say “when redstone went to sleep he demanded she go to sleep as well — even if she didn’t want to” in return redstone was a generous lover showering her with jewelry artwork cash hermes bags and weekly bouquets of red roses and orchids according to the papers “i will always love you you can always depend on me love sumner” he said in a handwritten note copied in the filing the court papers are peppered with photos from their fiveyear relationship — including a snapshot of a carat canary yellow engagement ring that she claims he gave her when they got engaged in  holland says in the papers that she agreed to “provide for redstone’s care and comfort” in exchange for him financially supporting her for her entire life in addition to putting holland into his trust redstone wrote that she would have “custody of his dogs sugar and butterfly” according to the papers but all that came to an end when she confessed to a “shortlived affair” and he booted her from his beverly park mansion she says “redstone breached this financial agreement when he unilaterally terminated the relationship and removed sydney as a beneficiary of his personal trust” the documents say now holland wants “a reasonable sum per month” for her and her daughter plus an amendment to his personal trust reinstating her as a beneficiary in the papers holland accuses the mogul’s daughter shari redstone of instructing “the staff to block sydney from redstone’e life to ensure that there was no reconciliation” between them holland’s legal bombshell was timed to target shari redstone sources said shari and sumner redstone announced monday that they’re backtracking on a plan to merge cbs and viacom the redstones control  percent of the voting stock of the two media giants which together form a  billion media empire “ms holland’s crosscomplaint is a work of fiction punctuated by notsosubtle threats of extortion and an overwhelming stench of greed” sumner redstone’s legal team said in a statement “the critical witnesses will not be mr redstone’s ‘celebrity friends’ but instead the nurses and household staff members who unlike ms holland were by his side day and night “it will be for the jury to weigh the contemporaneous notes and trial testimony of those disinterested witnesses against ms holland’s narcissistic false narrative in the end we are confident that justice will be done” share thisfacebooktwittergooglefacebook messengerwhatsappemailcopy filed under cbs   lawsuits   sumner redstone   sydney holland   the sumner sexcapades   viacom share this article share
