cleveland july   globe newswire  chart industries inc nasdaqgtls a leading diversified global manufacturer of highly engineered equipment for the industrial gas energy and biomedical industries today reported results for the second quarter ended june   highlights include record short leadtime shipments in the quarter strong operating cash flow of  million addition of william c johnson as president and chief operating officer net income for the second quarter of  was  million or  per diluted share second quarter  earnings would have been  per diluted share excluding  million or  per diluted share of restructuring and acquisitionrelated costs this compares with net income of  million or  per diluted share for the second quarter of  second quarter  earnings would have been  per diluted share excluding  million or  per diluted share of restructuring and acquisitionrelated costs including facility shutdown costs net sales for the second quarter of  decreased  to  million from  million in the comparable period a year ago gross profit for the second quarter of  was  million or  of sales versus  million or  of sales in the comparable quarter of  “we delivered better than anticipated results in our energy  chemicals “ec” segment through solid project execution several short leadtime replacement equipment opportunities supported by our newly created lifecycle aftermarket service offering and contract expiration fees related to project development which highlight our unique capabilities and competitive strengths the short leadtime shipments were a record in the quarter and eclipsed the prior record set in the fourth quarter of  stated sam thomas chart’s chairman and chief executive officer mr thomas added “we are focused on our working capital initiatives and are making good headway as we delivered another consecutive quarter with strong operating cash flow despite continued weakness in energy markets our geographic and product diversification highlights further advantages to support continued cash flow generation in july  bill johnson joined us as president and coo bringing operational and strategic talent that will help further these initiatives” orders received in the second quarter of  were  million an increase of  million over orders received during the first quarter of  in addition to the typical seasonality of the business order levels improved over the first quarter as we were awarded a number of significant projects across a variety of end markets within our distribution  storage ds and biomedical segments including a  million emerging energy application award and continued downstream lng activity in ds backlog at june   was  million up  from the march   level of  million selling general and administrative sga expenses for the second quarter of  increased  million compared with the same period in  to  million or  of sales  sga increased due to higher variable shortterm compensation expense which was accelerated compared to the prior year quarter as well as unfavorable reserves recorded at ds asia during the current quarter second quarter  sga also included  million in severance costs associated with cost reduction initiatives and other restructuringrelated charges income tax expense was  million for the second quarter of  and represented an effective tax rate of  compared with  million in the prior year quarter or an effective tax rate of   the effective tax rate for the current quarter is higher than s second quarter rate primarily as a result of tax losses in china for which no benefit is recorded  net interest expense was  million for the second quarter of  which included  million of noncash accretion expense associated with the company’s convertible notes net cash interest was  million segment highlights ec segment sales decreased  to  million for the second quarter of  compared with  million for the same quarter in the prior year the decline was due to lower sales volume seen across all product lines given continued challenging energy market conditions ec gross profit margins were  in the  quarter compared with  in the same quarter of  the improved margins were due to multiple short leadtime shipments contract expiration fees lifecycle aftermarket services favorable execution and project completions during the quarter the impact from the short leadtime shipments and contract expiration fees contributed about  million to ec’s gross profit in the quarter these short leadtime opportunities are typically critical shutdown situations to our customers which require us to respond immediately to supply replacement equipment although the timing of these events is not predictable they are recurring in nature and are an important part of our business and service to customers ds segment sales increased  to  million for the second quarter of  compared with  million for the same quarter in the prior year sales in north america and europe increased as a result of revenue recognized on projects related to both lng and industrial gas applications ds gross profit margins were  compared with  in the prior year quarter due to lower restructuring costs and improved volume in the current quarter biomedical segment sales decreased  to  million for the second quarter of  compared with  million for the same quarter in the prior year the decrease is primarily due to lower revenues in north american respiratory and commercial oxygen generation partially offset by an increase of new product revenues in life sciences and liquid oxygen revenues in europe biomedical gross profit margin increased to  in the quarter compared with  for the same period in  primarily due to product mix and lower warranty costs outlook based on yeartodate results continued weak order

nongaap are now expected to be in the range of  to  per share on approximately  million weighted average shares outstanding this compares with previous sales guidance of  million to  billion and
