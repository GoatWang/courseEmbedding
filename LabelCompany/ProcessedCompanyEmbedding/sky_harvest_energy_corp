december     oil  gas renewables by ania swiatoniowski there are exciting new things on the horizon for sky harvest energy corp otcbb skyh as a power generation company the company’s main focus is on utilityscale renewable energy sky harvest has been making a mark in the energy industry by announcing a string of positive developments in the past several months  sky harvest based in vancouver develops wind power sites and designs and manufactures vertical axis wind turbines  sky harvest announced their latest of several developments on december   it will begin a new relationship with the northern centre for advanced technology for testing and manufacturing sky harvest’s vertical axis wind turbines the company is also involved in establishing projects in turkey in underground natural gas storage and the european energy industry developing wind sites in saskatchewan sky harvest is a development stage company founded in   it has been developing three utility grade wind power sites in southwest saskatchewan birsay beechy and matador pasture — matador pasture is within the beechy area the company currently holds long term lease agreements and contractual interest in these areas –comprising over  acres– and are permitted to build wind power generation facilities on these lands birsay and matador pasture will each be approximately  mw facilities  sky harvests interests in the saskatchewan wind sites are the product of over eight years of investment in engineering and environmental studies conducted by firms prominent in the wind power industry these studies began with the inception of the company in  sky harvest owns two subsidiary companies in saskatchewan related to the wind sites keewatin windpower inc and sky harvest saskatchewan corp  william iny knows the complexities of developing a wind harvesting site iny started at sky harvest in  as a director and became president and ceo in  “saskatchewan is a dynamic place for wind” says iny as he explains why southwest saskatchewan is a particularly good place for wind harvesting “you have the cold air from the arctic descending and you also have warm air from the gulf of mexico ascending up towards the north pole where that air exchange happens is right over saskatchewan”  these winds are highest in southwest saskatchewan which is why sky harvest located there in  and began research into the viability of establishing wind sites in the region iny indicates his confidence in the sites saying “i think we hit the sweet spot there and we made a long term commitment to develop those projects”  but saskatchewan has other attractive qualities to a wind energy production company the saskatchewan government has identified wind power as part of their energy solution for their growing energy needs and are developing their long term wind strategy there are already five wind farms in saskatchewan but wind only accounts for  of energy production while fossil fuels account for  iny believes that wind energy will increase as dependence on fossil fuels decreases  sky harvest is currently developing the matador site a lease for which they hold from the government of saskatchewan two meteorological towers have been erected in the region sky harvest holds a government lease for another five years  “everything we do is very long term and we want to make sure that it fits in with the developmental objectives of the provincial government and with saskpower” says iny as he talks about the position sky harvest takes in the province sky harvest recently sold one of their former saskatchewanbased wind projects the birsay site to a major canadian company for cdnmillion design and manufacture of vertical axis wind turbines sky harvest is currently developing a  kwsize vertical axis wind turbine designed for smaller wind that would be implemented onto transmission towers and communications towers but also to power remote communities  “the inquiries we are getting right now are from all over the world especially europe — that is very strong on wind — from india the middle east and from northern canada where many communities are still powered by diesel” says iny explaining the market for the  kw turbines the small turbines would provide cleaner energy in remote communities and lessen cost associated with transporting fuel to these regions by helicopter  sky harvest plans to expand their  kw vertical axis wind turbine manufacturing arm of the company into europe and asia “we’re having discussions with several countries who are interested in a licence to manufacturer there” indicates iny the small turbines are under research and development and have already been awarded multipatents  sky harvest’s latest announcement released december th  is an agreement with the northern centre for advanced technology norcat located in ontario the  square foot research and development centre provides advanced facilities such as those for product testing in harsh and extreme environments and underground mine testing areas both of which represent environments where the turbines would be placed sky harvest’s subsidiary company sky vertical technologies inc designs and manufactures the vertical wind turbines natural gas in europe and turkey besides sky harvest’s developments in canada the company has its eyes on new opportunities in the natural gas industry in europe and turkey levant energy sky harvest’s company in turkey has made concrete movements in this direction  petroleum products en route to europe transit through turkey which makes puts these operations in a strategic location and allows levant to look toward developments related to natural gas deposits off the coast of israel  “we recognised that we were limiting ourselves somewhat with just wind power we started out as an alternative energy company which we still are but everything becomes interrelated at one point natural gas has an impact on wind oil prices have an impact on prices of natural gas everything is essentially interrelated… many times you can’t provide energy with just one solution such as wind or solar or hydro we wanted to expand our horizons to harness the different energy sources that are available”  nine years of commitment hard work and considerable investment are paying off for sky harvest and  has been a big year for the company in all three of the company’s areas of work developing wind sites in saskatchewan vertical axis wind turbine development and pursuing possibilities in the natural gas industries in europe and turkey  sky harvest energy
