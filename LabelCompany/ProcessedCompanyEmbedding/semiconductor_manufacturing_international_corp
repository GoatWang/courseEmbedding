reducing many of the export control barriers for smic in early  harvard business school wrote a case study on smics business model characterized as a reverse buildoperatetransfer bot the case study found that smic is executing a strategy that leverages the desires of municipalities in china to build clusters of high technology companies by partnering with those cities to build new semiconductor fabs that smic would then operate under contract the company could build scale without necessarily confronting immediate large capital outlays unlike the buildoperatetransfer model that some municipalities were using to build infrastructure like the new subway in shenzhen in the smic reverse bot model a municipality would build a capital intensive fab and smic would operate it sharply lowering its capital costs this model gave the company a unique level of flexibility in an industry where capital costs were the major driver of product costs in november  richard chang resigned as
