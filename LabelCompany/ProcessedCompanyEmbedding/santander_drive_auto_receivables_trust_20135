penalties injunctions or other actions      us bank national association as the indenture trustee has provided the following information since  various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs primarily investors have filed claims against us bank national association us bank in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee as the case may be under certain residential mortgage backed securities rmbs trusts the plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other rmbs trustees including deutsche bank citibank hsbc bank of new york mellon and wells fargo the complaints against us bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these rmbs trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality the complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default currently us bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being blackrock balanced capital portfolio et al v us bank national association  no  ny sup ct class action alleging claims with respect to approximately  trusts and its companion case blackrock core bond portfolio et al v us bank national association  no cv sdny some of the trusts implicated

the outcome of any of the litigation or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the rmbs trusts however us bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the rmbs trusts in good faith that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses and it intends to contest the plaintiffs claims vigorously    part
