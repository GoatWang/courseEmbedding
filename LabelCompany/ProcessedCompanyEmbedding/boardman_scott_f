boardman team fs  weightweight prosbalanced agile ride and it looks the moneyconsthe frame could be stiffer product boardman team fs  review manufacturer boardman price as reviewed £ this product is featured in the best cheap mountain bikes the last time we tested the team fs we complained that our knees knocked on the upper shock linkage and that the mm travel suspension felt too comfort focused lacking the support needed to push the bike to the limit our criticisms didn’t go unnoticed and boardman has now fitted a narrower upper linkage with much improved clearance and it has also change the angle of it relative to the shock to make the suspension more progressive and supportive buy now boardman team fs  from halfords for £  the best cheap mountain bikes and boardman hasn’t stopped there the frame geometry has also been tweaked yes the head angle has actually got steeper but the frame has also increased in length so the bike feels much more balanced than the previous version also with the extra reach boardman can fit a mm stem as standard without the cockpit feeling too cramped all that’s needed now is a size xl frame for riders over ft just like all of the other bikes in this test cost dictates that the boardman gets a mm quickrelease rear end not the stiffer xmm thruaxle design on the pro fs and due to the pivot placement on the chainstay the back end is not quite as stiff or direct as the calibre bossnut  will this £ supermarket bike survive a dh course all of the pivots use sealed cartridge bearings to reduce friction and make servicing easier and the overall frame finish — smooth welds and fluidformed tubes — is first rate the end result being that the team fs looks like a bike costing double suspension with slightly more air pressure than recommended for our weight we easily achieved the frontend support we wanted from the mm sektor fork even if it meant that we couldn’t quite reach bottom out with a tapered steerer tube mm upper legs and mm maxle lowers the team fs takes hits big and small without complaint it also puts boardman on a level playing field with calibre and voodoo no more kneeknocking thanks to boardman’s new slimline upper link even though the boardman is rocking mm less travel at the rear the bike felt really well balanced from the off but just like most of the other bikes in this test we had to run the rebound damping on the monarch r shock wideopen so again we get the feeling that all of the brands wrongly assume that it will be heavier riders buying these bikes components the team fs is the only bike in this test not to use a shimano drivetrain instead boardman has opted for a sram gx × setup shifting is both crisp and precise but we had noticeably more dropped chains on the boardman than any other bike we’ve had no such problems with the chain stabilising type ii rear mechs on sram’s singlering gx drivetrains so we suspect that the frame flex we mentioned earlier — or more likely the fsa comet chainset — could be the real issue here maxle thruaxle and tapered steerer tie up solid front end and if we’re being really picky about the components on the boardman we’d like to see an inline seat post to help offset the slack seat tube angle as it stands when you raise the saddle height it ends up being too far behind the bottom bracket which makes it more difficult to keep the front wheel comfortably loaded on steep climbs and while it’s great that the team fs comes with lockon grips they are too skinny for size large hands on a size large bike greater reach this year means a stubby stem doesn’t feel cramped performance sometimes you need to take a step backwards to move forwards and that’s exactly what boardman has done with the team fs and even though we’re big fans of slacker head angles the handling of the boardman is so much more balanced with the steeper steering geometry and extra length in the front end of the frame  best mountain bike tyres so when the hard compound continental tyres break traction — which they regularly do — you still feel in control of the bike if you can survive the sketchy drifts from one corner to the next the conti tyres reward you with reduced rolling resistance less experienced riders however will be rolling the dice every time they ride buy now boardman team fs  from halfords for £ verdict all of changes that boardman has made to the team fs for  are positive ones you still get one of the bestdressed bikes for under a grand but the frame now possesses a ride quality that’s every bit as fitting as the finishing kit adorning it in the end it was a very close call between the boardman team fs and the calibre bossnut if the team fs came with the stiffer xmm rear end and better tyres boardman could easily be looking at a doubledigit rating

  shares shares product overview overall rating score  proslightest on test at just under lbsram force groupsetritchey wcs finishing kitstiff and fastridingconsmm cranks are a strange choice product boardman pro carbon manufacturer boardman price as reviewed £ this product is featured in  best road bikes under £ for  the boardman pro carbon at a whisker under lb is the lightest on test by a long chalk with its t unidirectional carbon monocoque it was no surprise that the boardman had a ‘racy’ feel its handling was likened by more than one rider to scott’s cr which is certainly a compliment given the success of the cr which was a benchmark carbon frame the boardman pro carbon gets top marks when it comes to the ups its sublb weight is over lb lighter than anything else in the test and when the difference is that marked combined with a quality carbon frame you’ve got a winning combination like the wilier the boardman frame is a monocoque construction and it’s difficult to separate their climbing prowess they’re both stiff light and responsive but the ritchey wcs wheels on the boardman are top notch and give it a competitive edge boardman bikes the range explained  the boardman was more of a handful once you were going full flight both it and the wilier picked up speed well and it was becoming apparent that these two bikes’ frames shared a number of similar traits except the boardman’s combination of low weight stiff wheels and stiff frame gave it a tendency to skip around if you weren’t careful the equipment on all four bikes isl pretty good stuff but what stood out was the big gap between the kit on the wilier mortirolo mirage and that on the boardman pro carbon ok so the wilier is a couple of hundred pounds cheaper but even so its campagnolo mirage spec while a solid choice is somewhat belittled by the sram force and ritchey wcs kit on the boardman the only small specrelated gripe was the mm truvativ gxp carbon cranks that we felt were too small for the bike nice kit’s one thing but it’s no good if it doesn’t fit the rider verdict the boardman pro carbon is a lot of bike for your cash and stands head and shoulders above the rest it’s the lightest by a mile thanks in part to its topend spec and we struggled to find much to complain about with its performance if we were to nitpick then it could do with a smidgin more comfort the mm crank issue was a
