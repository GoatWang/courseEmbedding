key transportation links the government of canada assumed majority ownership of the near bankrupt canadian northern railway cnor on september   and appointed a board of management to oversee the

ntr and the prince edward island railway peir among others on december   the federal government created the canadian national railways cnr – a title only with no corporate powers – through a canadian

construction loans to the federal government the federal governments department of railways and canals took over operation of the gtpr until july   when it too was placed under the cnr the canadian national railway was organized on october   finally the bankrupt gtr itself was placed under the care of a federal government board of management on may   while gtr management and shareholders opposed to nationalization took legal action after several years of arbitration the gtr was absorbed into cnr on january   in subsequent years several smaller independent railways would be added to the cnr as they went bankrupt or it became politically expedient to do so however the system was more or less finalized following the addition of the gtr canadian national railways was born out of both wartime and domestic urgency railways until the rise of the personal automobile and creation of taxpayerfunded allweather highways were the only viable longdistance land transportation available in canada for many years as such their operation consumed a great deal of public and political attention many countries regard railway networks as critical infrastructure even to this day and at the time of the creation of cnr during the continuing threat of the first world war canada was not the only country to engage in railway nationalization in the early th century many governments were taking a more interventionist role in the economy foreshadowing the influence of economists like john maynard keynes this political trend combined with broader geopolitical events made nationalization an appealing choice for canada the winnipeg general strike of  and allied involvement in the russian revolution seemed to validate the continuing process the need for a viable rail system was paramount in a time

controversiesedit in december  the ultratrain a petroleum products unit train linking the levis quebec ultramar oil refinery with a petroleum depot in montreal exploded when it collided with a derailed freight train travelling in the opposite direction between saintemadeleine and sainthilaireest south of montreal killing the crew of the freight train the ultratrain crew’s last words were “you guys are derailed we’re hitting you” the other train derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld that was not fixed in time despite being repeatedly reported by train crews the report by the transportation safety board of canada called into question cns quality assurance program for rail welds as well as the lack of detection equipment for defective wheels in memory of the dead crewmen two new stations on the line have been named after them davis and thériault on may   a cn train derailed at  pm north of vermontville highway in potterville michigan the train was hauling a total of  cars thirtyfive of the cars derailed and  of them contained hazmat material nine were carrying propane and two cars carried sulfuric acid two of the propane tankers were leaking and a third was suspected of leaking each propane car contains  gallons of propane gas which is considered an extreme fire and explosive hazard an evacuation of potterville was declared cn along with other agencies worked throughout the week to clean the area a second cn train derailment in potterville michigan occurred in may  though no evacuation was necessary the cause of this derailment was found to be a failed wheel bearing on the nd car about  am central standard time on february   northbound cn freight train m derailed  of its  cars in tamaroa illinois four of the derailed cars released methanol and the methanol from two of these four cars fueled a fire other derailed cars contained phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid formaldehyde and vinyl chloride two cars containing hydrochloric acid one car containing formaldehyde and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire about  residents were evacuated from the area within a mile  km radius of the derailment which included the entire village of tamaroa improper placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions rapidly progressed to rail failure on may   a trestle collapsed under the weight of a freight train near mcbride bc killing both crew members both men had been disciplined earlier for refusing to take another train on the same bridge claiming it was unsafe it was revealed that as far back as  several bridge components had been reported as rotten yet no repairs had been ordered by management eventually the disciplinary records of both crewmen were amended posthumously controversy arose again in canadian political circles in  following the companys decision to refer solely to its acronym cn and not canadian national a move some interpret as being an attempt to distance the company from references to canada canadas minister of transport at the time called this policy move obscene after nationalists noted it could be argued the company is no longer canadian being primarily owned by american stockholders the controversy is somewhat tempered by the fact a majority of large corporations are being increasingly referred to by acronyms in march  a strike by the canadian auto workers union showed deeprooted divisions between organized labour and the companys current management the cn north america logo this was used from – before the company returned to the plain cn logo which is still in use the residents of wabamun lake in alberta staged a blockade of cn tracks in august  when they were unsatisfied with the railways response to a derailment catastrophe that spilled over  litres of tarry fuel oil and about  l of carcinogenic pole treatment oil into the lake reporters found prespill evidence cn executives admitted cn failed to provide public safety information to prevent public exposure to carcinogenic toxic chemicals the tarlike oil and chemicals killed over  large migratory birds animals fish and other aquatic life on august   in the cheakamus river derailment a cn train had nine cars derail on a bridge over the cheakamus river causing  litres  us gal of caustic soda to spill into the river killing thousands of fish by caustic burns and asphyxiation the cbc reported environmental experts say it would take the river  years or more to recover from the toxic pollution cn is facing accusations from local british columbians over the railways supposed lack of response to this issue touted as the worst chemical spill in british columbias history transport canada has restricted cn to trains not exceeding  car lengths because of the multiple derailments on the former bcr line north from squamish this was due to sufficient warnings from the former bc rail to canadian national railway to avoid trains of over  cars unfortunately these warnings were ignored by cn who had been running trains well in excess of  cars on this winding and mountainous section of track known for some of the steepest track in north america a further derailment at moran  miles  km north of lillooet on june   has raised more questions about cns safety policies two more derailments near lytton in august  have continued criticism in the first case  coal cars of a cpr train using a cn bridge derailed dumping  cars of coal into the thompson river in the second case half a dozen grain cars spilled on a cn train two cn trains collided on august   on

such as lumber or pipes about  pm central daylight time on friday june   eastbound cn freight train u traveling at  miles per hour  kmh derailed at a highwayrail grade crossing in cherry valley illinois near rockford the train consisted of  locomotives and  cars  of which derailed all of the derailed cars were tank cars carrying denatured fuel ethanol a flammable liquid thirteen of the derailed tank cars were breached or lost product and caught fire at the time of the derailment several motor vehicles were stopped on either side of the grade crossing waiting for the train to pass as a result of the fire that erupted after the derailment a passenger in one of the stopped cars was fatally injured two passengers in the same car received serious injuries and five occupants of other cars waiting at the highwayrail crossing were injured two responding firefighters also sustained minor injuries the release of ethanol and the resulting fire prompted a mandatory evacuation of about  residences within a mile  km radius of the accident site monetary damages were estimated to total  million the probable cause of the accident was the washout of the track structure that was discovered about  hour before the trains arrival and cns failure to notify the train crew of the known washout in time to stop the train because of the inadequacy of cns emergency communication procedures contributing to the accident was the cns failure to work with winnebago county to develop a comprehensive storm water management plan to address the previous washouts in  and  contributing to the severity of the accident was the cns failure to issue the flash flood warning to the train crew and the inadequate design of the dot tank cars which made the cars subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials in the derailment in october  the james street bridge between thunder bay and fort william first nation was subject to an act of arson causing great structural damage to the bridge the bridge was the most direct route between thunder bay and fort william first nation reserve and was used by foot traffic vehicular traffic and rail traffic the matter of who is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the bridge is subject to great controversy between the city of thunder bay and cn due to an agreement dating back to  between the grand trunk pacific railway company later incorporated as cnr along with other railways and the city of fort william later merged with the city of port arthur into the city of thunder bay the  agreement states that the company will give the municipal corporation the perpetual right to cross said bridge for vehicle and foot traffic and that the company will maintain the bridge in perpetuity without cost to the town after the fire cn made repairs to the bridge for use of its rail system but did not repair the damage to the vehicle lanes which render it unsafe for vehicle use cn maintains that the  agreement does not speak to replacement of the bridge while the position of the city of thunder bay is that cn is solely responsible for making the necessary repairs to restore function to the vehicle lanes of the bridge in the years following cns  acquisition of illinois central the company has come under scrutiny for illicit practices that allegedly cause the delay of amtrak schedules in  amtrak filed a formal complaint against cn with the surface transportation board stating that the prioritization of freight traffic over passenger traffic was commonplace on amtrak routes operating on cn lines the complaint cited over  delays during fiscal year  on the route between chicago and carbondale totaling over  days of net wasted schedule time it also reported  of delays between chicago and new orleans

of routes from its constituent railways but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network for example on december   cnr inaugurated the continental limited which operated over four of its predecessors as well as the temiskaming and northern ontario railway the s saw growth in passenger travel and cnr inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services such as radio on its trains however the growth in passenger travel ended with the great depression which lasted between  and  but picked up somewhat in world war ii by the end of world war ii many of cnrs passenger cars were old and worn down accidents at dugald manitoba in  and canoe river british columbia in  wherein extra passenger trains composed of older wooden equipment collided with transcontinental passenger trains composed of newer allsteel equipment demonstrated the dangers inherent in the older cars in  cnr ordered  lightweight passenger cars allowing them to reequip their major routes on april   the same day that the cpr introduced its transcontinental train the canadian cnr introduced its own new transcontinental passenger train the super continental which used new streamlined rolling stock however the super continental was never considered as glamorous as the canadian for example it did not include dome cars dome cars would be added in the early s with the purchase of six former milwaukee road super domes they were used on the super continental in the summer tourist season new servicesedit rail passenger traffic in canada declined significantly between world war ii and  due to automobiles and airplanes in the s cns privately owned rival cpr reduced its passenger services significantly however the governmentowned cn continued much of its passenger services and marketed new schemes one introduced on  april  was the red white and blue fare structure which offered deep discounts on offpeak days red and were credited with increasing passenger numbers on some routes as much as  another exercise was the rebranding of the express trains in the ontario–quebec corridor with the rapido label in  cn introduced a new highspeed train the united aircraft turbo which was powered by gas turbines instead of diesel engines it made the trip between toronto and montreal in four hours but was not entirely successful because it was somewhat uneconomical and not always reliable the trainsets were retired in  and later scrapped at metrecy in laval quebec on cns narrow gauge lines in newfoundland cn also operated a main line passenger train that ran from st johns to port aux basques called the caribou nicknamed the newfie bullett this train ran until june  it was replaced by the cn roadcruiser buses the cn roadcruiser service was started in fall  and was run in direct competition with the companys own passenger train travellers saw that the buses could travel between st johns and port aux basques in  hours versus the trains  hours after the demise of the caribou the only passenger train service run by cn on the island were the mixed freight and passenger trains that ran on the bonavista carbonear and argentia branch lines the only passenger service surviving on the main line was between bishops falls and corner brook in  cn created an entity called viacn as a separate operating unit for its passenger services via evolved into a coordinated marketing effort with cp rail for rail passenger services and later into a separate crown corporation responsible for intercity passenger services in canada via rail took over cns passenger services on april   declineedit cn continued to fund its commuter rail services in montreal until  when the montreal urban community transit commission muctc assumed financial responsibility for them operation was contracted out to cn which eventually spun off a separate subsidiary montrain for this purpose when the montreal–deuxmontagnes line was completely rebuilt in – the new rolling stock came under the ownership of the muctc until a separate government agency the agence métropolitaine de transport amt was set up to consolidate all suburban transit administration around montreal since then suburban

beyergarratt and englishelectric in  three general electric centrecab electric locomotives were added to the fleet in  cn added electric multiple units built by canadian car and foundry electrification was restricted to montreal and went from central station to saintlambert south turcot west montréalnord east and sainteustachesurlelac later renamed deuxmontagnes north but as steam locomotives gave way to diesels engine changeovers were no longer necessary and catenary was eventually pulled from the west east and from the south however until the end of the original

tandem connecting two trains together into a larger fourteencar arrangement with a total capacity of  passengers the canadian trains were built by montreal locomotive works with their st engines supplied by uacs canadian division now prattwhitney canada in longueuil quebec cn and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit so they dropped the train from the name in cns marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the turbo although it retained the full turbotrain name in cns own documentation and communication with uac a goal of cns marketing campaign was to get the train into service for expo  and the turbo was rushed through its trials it was late for expo a disappointment to all involved but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing the turbos first demonstration run in december  with conductor james abbey of toronto in command included a large press contingent an hour into its debut run the turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near kingston the turbos final run was on october   dieseledit in  the cnr made its first experiment with diesel electric

historical marker at site of canadian nationals last spike near ashcroft british columbia creation of the company –edit in response to public concerns fearing loss of key transportation links the government of canada assumed majority ownership of the near bankrupt canadian northern railway cnor on september   and appointed a board of management to oversee the company at the same time cnor was also directed to assume management of canadian government railways cgr a system comprising the intercolonial railway of canada irc national transcontinental railway ntr and the prince edward island railway peir among others on december   the federal government created the canadian national railways cnr – a title only with no corporate powers – through a canadian privy council order in council as a means to simplify the funding and operation of the various railway companies the absorption of the intercolonial railway would see cnr adopt that systems slogan the peoples railway another canadian

government the federal governments department of railways and canals took over operation of the gtpr until july   when it too was placed under the cnr the canadian national railway was organized on october   finally the bankrupt gtr itself was placed under the care of a federal government board of management on may   while gtr management and shareholders opposed to nationalization took legal action after several years of arbitration the gtr was absorbed into cnr on january   in subsequent years several smaller independent railways would be added to the cnr as they went bankrupt or it became politically expedient to do so however the system was more or less finalized following the addition of the gtr canadian national railways was born out of both wartime and domestic urgency railways until the rise of the personal automobile and creation of taxpayerfunded allweather highways were the only viable longdistance land transportation available in canada for many years as such their operation consumed a great deal of public and political attention many countries regard railway networks as critical infrastructure even to this day and at the time of the creation of cnr during the continuing threat of the first world war canada was not the only country to engage in railway nationalization in the early th century many governments were taking a more interventionist role in the economy foreshadowing the influence of economists like john maynard keynes this political trend combined with broader geopolitical events made nationalization an appealing choice for canada the winnipeg general strike of  and allied involvement in the russian revolution seemed to validate the continuing process the need for a viable rail system was paramount in a time of civil unrest and

with the winning bidder receiving bcrs surface operating assets locomotives cars and service facilities the provincial government is retaining ownership of the tracks and rightofway on november   it was announced cns bid of  billion cad would be accepted over those of cpr and several us companies the transaction was closed effective july   many opponents – including cpr – accused the government and cn of rigging the bidding process though this has been denied by the government documents relating to the case are under court seal as they are connected to a parallel marijuana growop investigation connected with two senior government aides also involved in the sale of bc rail also contested was the economic stimulus package the government gave cities along the bc rail route some saw it as a buyoff to get the municipalities to cooperate with the lease though the government asserted the package was intended to promote economic development along the corridor passenger service along the route had been ended by bc rail a few years earlier due to ongoing losses resulting from deteriorating service the cancelled passenger service has subsequently been replaced by a blueplate tourist service the rocky mountaineer with fares well over double what the bcr coach fares had been cn also announced in october  an agreement to purchase great lakes transportation glt a holding company owned by blackstone group for  million usd glt was the owner of bessemer  lake erie railroad duluth missabe and iron range railway and the pittsburgh  conneaut dock company the key instigator for the deal was the fact that since the wisconsin central purchase cn was required to use duluth missabe and iron range railway trackage rights for a short  mi  km gap near duluth minnesota on the route between chicago and winnipeg to purchase this short section cn was told by glt it would have to purchase the entire company also included in glts portfolio were  great lakes vessels for transporting bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore as well as various port facilities following surface transportation board approval for the transaction cn completed the purchase of glt on may   on december   the stb approved cns purchase for  million of the principal lines of the elgin joliet  eastern railway company eje reporting mark eje from us steel corp originally announced on september   the stbs decision was to become effective on january   with a closure of the transaction shortly thereafter the eje lines create a bypass around the western side of heavily congested chicagoarea rail hub and its conversion to use for mainline freight traffic is expected to alleviate substantial bottlenecks for both regional and intercontinental rail traffic subject to lengthy delays entering and exiting chicago freight yards the purchase of the lightly used eje corridor was positioned by cn as a boon not only for its own business but for the efficiency of the entire us rail system on december   cn completed the merger of duluth missabe and iron range railway company duluth winnipeg and pacific railway company and wisconsin central ltd into its wisconsin central ltd subsidiary cn todayedit since the company operates in two countries cn maintains some corporate distinction by having its us lines incorporated under the grand trunk corporation for legal purposes however the entire company in both canada and the us operates under cn as can be seen in its locomotive and rail car repainting programs since the illinois central purchase in  cn has been increasingly focused on running a scheduled freight railroadrailway this has resulted in improved shipper relations as well as reduced the need for maintaining pools of surplus locomotives and freight cars cn has also undertaken a rationalization of its existing track network by removing double track sections in some areas and extending passing sidings in other areas cn is also a rail industry leader in the employment of radiocontrol rc for switching locomotives in yards resulting in reductions to the number of yard workers required cn has frequently been touted in recent years within north american rail industry circles as being the mostimproved railroad in terms of productivity and the lowering of its operating ratio acknowledging the fact the company is becoming increasingly profitable due to the rising popularity of ethanol shuttle trains and mineral commodities cn rail service is increasing in popularity projectsedit in april  a plan was announced to build an  kilometres  mi railway that

a potential alternative to conventional diesel fuel two sd dieselelectric locomotives fuelled with  natural gas and  diesel are in service between edmonton and fort mcmurray alberta recent controversiesedit in december  the ultratrain a petroleum products unit train linking the levis quebec ultramar oil refinery with a petroleum depot in montreal exploded when it collided with a derailed freight train travelling in the opposite direction between saintemadeleine and sainthilaireest south of montreal killing the crew of the freight train the ultratrain crew’s last words were “you guys are derailed we’re hitting you” the other train derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld that was not fixed in time despite being repeatedly reported by train crews the report by the transportation safety board of canada called into question cns quality assurance program for rail welds as well as the lack of detection equipment for defective wheels in memory of the dead crewmen two new stations on the line have been named after them davis and thériault on may   a cn train derailed at  pm north of vermontville highway in potterville michigan the train was hauling a total of  cars thirtyfive of the cars derailed and  of them contained hazmat material nine were carrying propane and two cars carried sulfuric acid two of the propane tankers were leaking and a third was suspected of leaking each propane car contains  gallons of propane gas which is considered an extreme fire and explosive hazard an evacuation of potterville was declared cn along with other agencies worked throughout the week to clean the area a second cn train derailment in potterville michigan occurred in may  though no evacuation was necessary the cause of this derailment was found to be a failed wheel bearing on the nd car about  am central standard time on february   northbound cn freight train m derailed  of its  cars in tamaroa illinois four of the derailed cars released methanol and the methanol from two of these four cars fueled a fire other derailed cars contained phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid formaldehyde and vinyl chloride two cars containing hydrochloric acid one car containing formaldehyde and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire about  residents were evacuated from the area within a mile  km radius of the derailment which included the entire village of tamaroa improper placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions rapidly progressed to rail failure on may   a trestle collapsed under the weight of a freight train near mcbride bc killing both crew members both men had been disciplined earlier for refusing to take another train on the same bridge claiming it was unsafe it was revealed that as far back as  several bridge components had been reported as rotten yet no repairs had been ordered by management eventually the disciplinary records of both crewmen were amended posthumously controversy arose again in canadian political circles in  following the companys decision to refer solely to its acronym cn and not canadian national a move some interpret as being an attempt to distance the company from references to canada canadas minister of transport at the time called this policy move obscene after nationalists noted it could be argued the company is no longer canadian being primarily owned by american stockholders the controversy is somewhat tempered by the fact a majority of large corporations are being increasingly referred to by acronyms in march  a strike by the canadian auto workers union showed deeprooted divisions between organized labour and the companys current management the cn north america logo this was used from – before the company returned to the plain cn logo which is still in use the residents of wabamun lake in alberta staged a blockade of cn tracks in august  when they were unsatisfied with the railways response to a derailment catastrophe that spilled over  litres of tarry fuel oil and about  l of carcinogenic pole treatment oil into the lake reporters found prespill evidence cn executives admitted cn failed to provide public safety information to prevent public exposure to carcinogenic toxic chemicals the tarlike oil and chemicals killed over  large migratory birds animals fish and other aquatic life on august   in the cheakamus river derailment a cn train had nine cars derail on a bridge over the cheakamus river causing  litres  us gal of caustic soda to spill into the river killing thousands of fish by caustic burns and asphyxiation the cbc reported environmental experts say it would take the river  years or more to recover from the toxic pollution cn is facing accusations from local british columbians over the railways supposed lack of response to this issue touted as the worst chemical spill in british columbias history transport canada has restricted cn to trains not exceeding  car lengths because of the multiple derailments on the former bcr line north from squamish this was due to sufficient warnings from the former bc rail to canadian national railway to avoid trains of over  cars unfortunately these warnings were ignored by cn who had been running trains well in excess of  cars on this winding and mountainous section of track known for some of the steepest track in north america a further derailment at moran  miles  km north of lillooet on june   has raised more questions about cns safety policies two more derailments near lytton in august  have continued criticism in the first case  coal cars of a cpr train using a cn bridge derailed dumping  cars of coal into the thompson river in the second case half a dozen grain cars spilled on a cn train two cn trains collided on august   on the banks of the fraser river near prince george bc several cars carrying gasoline diesel and lumber burst into flames water bombers were used to help put out the fires some fuel had seeped into the fraser river on december   a cn train derailed near edmonton in strathcona county alberta at  am mountain standard time of the  cars derailed most of them were empty or carrying nonhazardous materials such as lumber or pipes about  pm central daylight time on friday june   eastbound cn freight train u traveling at  miles per hour  kmh derailed at a highwayrail grade crossing in cherry valley illinois near rockford the train consisted of  locomotives and  cars  of which derailed all of the derailed cars were tank cars carrying denatured fuel ethanol a flammable liquid thirteen of the derailed tank cars were breached or lost product and caught fire at the time of the derailment several motor vehicles were stopped on either side of the grade crossing waiting for the train to pass as a result of the fire that erupted after the derailment a passenger in one of the stopped cars was fatally injured two passengers in the same car received serious injuries and five occupants of other cars waiting at the highwayrail crossing were injured two responding firefighters also sustained minor injuries the release of ethanol and the resulting fire prompted a mandatory evacuation of about  residences within a mile  km radius of the accident site monetary damages were estimated to total  million the probable cause of the accident was the washout of the track structure that was discovered about  hour before the trains arrival and cns failure to notify the train crew of the known washout in time to stop the train because of the inadequacy of cns emergency communication procedures contributing to the accident was the cns failure to work with winnebago county to develop a comprehensive storm water management plan to address the previous washouts in  and  contributing to the severity of the accident was the cns failure to issue the flash flood warning to the train crew and the inadequate design of the dot tank cars which made the cars subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials in the derailment in october  the james street bridge between thunder bay and fort william first nation was subject to an act of arson causing great structural damage to the bridge the bridge was the most direct route between thunder bay and fort william first nation reserve and was used by foot traffic vehicular traffic and rail traffic the matter of who is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the bridge is subject to great controversy between the city of thunder bay and cn due to an agreement dating back to  between the grand trunk pacific railway company later incorporated as cnr along with other railways and the city of fort william later merged with the city of port arthur into the city of thunder bay the  agreement states that the company will give the municipal corporation the perpetual right to cross said bridge for vehicle and foot traffic and that the company will maintain the bridge in perpetuity without cost to the town after the fire cn made repairs to the bridge for use of its rail system but did not repair the damage to the vehicle lanes which render it unsafe for vehicle use cn maintains that the  agreement does not speak to replacement of the bridge while the position of the city of thunder bay is that cn is solely responsible for making the necessary repairs to restore function to the vehicle lanes of the bridge in the years following cns  acquisition of illinois central the company has come under scrutiny for illicit practices that allegedly cause the delay of amtrak schedules in  amtrak filed a formal complaint against cn with the surface transportation board stating that the prioritization of freight traffic over passenger traffic was commonplace on amtrak routes operating on cn lines the complaint cited over  delays during fiscal year  on the route between chicago and carbondale totaling over  days of net wasted schedule time it also reported  of delays between chicago and new orleans

of routes from its constituent railways but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network for example on december   cnr inaugurated the continental limited which operated over four of its predecessors as well as the temiskaming and northern ontario railway the s saw growth in passenger travel and cnr inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services such as radio on its trains however the growth in passenger travel ended with the great depression which lasted between  and  but picked up somewhat in world war ii by the end of world war ii many of cnrs passenger cars were old and worn down accidents at dugald manitoba in  and canoe river british columbia in  wherein extra passenger trains composed of older wooden equipment collided with transcontinental passenger trains composed of newer allsteel equipment demonstrated the dangers inherent in the older cars in  cnr ordered  lightweight passenger cars allowing them to reequip their major routes on april   the same day that the cpr introduced its transcontinental train the canadian cnr introduced its own new transcontinental passenger train the super continental which used new streamlined rolling stock however the super continental was never considered as glamorous as the canadian for example it did not include dome cars dome cars would be added in the early s with the purchase of six former milwaukee road super domes they were used on the super continental in the summer tourist season new servicesedit rail passenger traffic in canada declined significantly between world war ii and  due to automobiles and airplanes in the s cns privately owned rival cpr reduced its passenger services significantly however the governmentowned cn continued much of its passenger services and marketed new schemes one introduced on  april  was the red white and blue fare structure which offered deep discounts on offpeak days red and were credited with increasing passenger numbers on some routes as much as  another exercise was the rebranding of the express trains in the ontario–quebec corridor with the rapido label in  cn introduced a new highspeed train the united aircraft turbo which was powered by gas turbines instead of diesel engines it made the trip between toronto and montreal in four hours but was not entirely successful because it was somewhat uneconomical and not always reliable the trainsets were retired in  and later scrapped at metrecy in laval quebec on cns narrow gauge lines in newfoundland cn also operated a main line passenger train that ran from st johns to port aux basques called the caribou nicknamed the newfie bullett this train ran until june  it was replaced by the cn roadcruiser buses the cn roadcruiser service was started in fall  and was run in direct competition with the companys own passenger train travellers saw that the buses could travel between st johns and port aux basques in  hours versus the trains  hours after the demise of the caribou the only passenger train service run by cn on the island were the mixed freight and passenger trains that ran on the bonavista carbonear and argentia branch lines the only passenger service surviving on the main line was between bishops falls and corner brook in  cn created an entity called viacn as a separate operating unit for its passenger services via evolved into a coordinated marketing effort with cp rail for rail passenger services and later into a separate crown corporation responsible for intercity passenger services in canada via rail took over cns passenger services on april   declineedit cn continued to fund its commuter rail services in montreal until  when the montreal urban community transit commission muctc assumed financial responsibility for them operation was contracted out to cn which eventually spun off a separate subsidiary montrain for this purpose when the montreal–deuxmontagnes line was completely rebuilt in – the new rolling stock came under the ownership of the muctc until a separate government agency the agence métropolitaine de transport amt was set up to consolidate all suburban transit administration around montreal since then suburban service has resumed to sainthilaire and a new line to mascouche opened in december  in newfoundland terra transport would continue to operate the mixed trains on the branch lines until  the main line

british columbia called the kaoham shuttle cn crews used to operate commuter trains on behalf of go transit in the toronto and the surrounding vicinity this changed in  when a deal was reached with bombardier transportation that switched all cn crews for bombardier crews in january  cn announced it was cutting the service from sault ste marie to hearst blaming the canadian federal government for cutting a subsidy necessary to keep the service running it has been argued in the past as an essential service however the service has always been deemed financially uneconomic despite an extension of

the canadian northern railway several boxcab electrics used through the mount royal tunnel those were built between  and  by general electric in schenectady new york to operate the new montreal central station which opened in  and was to be kept free of locomotive smoke they were supplemented by nearly identical locomotives from the national harbours board those engines were built in  by beyergarratt and englishelectric in  three general electric centrecab electric locomotives were added to the fleet in  cn added electric multiple units built by canadian car and foundry electrification was restricted to montreal and went from central station to saintlambert south turcot west montréalnord east and sainteustachesurlelac later renamed deuxmontagnes north but as steam locomotives gave way to diesels engine changeovers were no longer necessary and catenary was eventually pulled from the west east and from the south however until the end of the original electrification cns electric locomotives pulled via rails trains including its diesel electric locomotives to and from central station the last  v dc cn electric locomotive ran on june   the very same locomotive that pulled the inaugural train through the mount royal tunnel back in  later in  the amts electric multiple units began operating under  kv ac  hz electrification and in  dualpower locomotives entered service on the mascouche line turboedit in may  canadian national railways ordered five sevencar uac turbotrain for the montreal–toronto service it planned to operate them in tandem connecting two trains together into a larger fourteencar arrangement with a total capacity of  passengers the canadian trains were built by montreal locomotive works with their st engines supplied by uacs canadian division now prattwhitney canada in longueuil quebec cn and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit so they dropped the train from the name in cns marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the turbo although it retained the full turbotrain name in cns own documentation and communication with uac a goal of cns marketing campaign was to get the train into service for expo  and the turbo was rushed through its trials it was late for expo a disappointment to all involved but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing the turbos first demonstration run in december  with conductor james abbey of toronto in command included a large press contingent an hour into its debut run the turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near kingston the turbos final run was on october   dieseledit in  the cnr made its first experiment with diesel electric locomotives acquiring two from westinghouse numbered  and  it was the first north american railway to use diesels in mainline service these early units proved the feasibility of the diesel concept but

locomotives have long featured unique features unlike the stock emd and ge locomotives cn introduced a widenosed four window comfort cab the predecessor to the now standard north american safety cab which is now standard on new north american freight locomotives cn train at east junction edmonton  ditch lights after a bc derailment cn introduced ditch lights lights mounted on or just below the anticlimbers on the front pilot of a locomotive these are used to make trains more visible at gradecrossings and to give better visibility around curves since then ditch lights have become standard features on all north american locomotives class and marker lights cn continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years up to as recently as the cm and sdf which feature red green and white class lights and the first order cwl locomotives which retained white class lights more recently cn has had red marker lights installed on their esdc and sdm locomotives for use when the locomotives are in dpu service windshields cns first few orders of esdcs like their cws feature teardrop windshields windshields with the outer lower corner dropped like earlier sdis as opposed to the standard rectangular ge windshield for better range of vision headlights the first order of sdm locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab while the second order  series dropped the headlight to the nose and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab control stands while many railroads have ordered new desktop controls where the controls are arranged on a desk—cn returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally this arrangement makes reverse operation easier and allows engineers to put their feet up without feeling stuck at a desk all day car body cns general motors sdf sdf retired bombardier

railway peir among others on december   the federal government created the canadian national railways cnr – a title only with no corporate powers – through a canadian privy council order in council as

october   finally the bankrupt gtr itself was placed under the care of a federal government board of management on may   while gtr management and shareholders opposed to nationalization took legal action after several years of arbitration the gtr was absorbed into cnr on january   in subsequent years several smaller independent railways would be added to the cnr as they went bankrupt or it became politically expedient to do so however the system was more or less finalized following the addition of the gtr canadian national railways was born out of both wartime and domestic urgency railways until the rise of the personal automobile and creation of taxpayerfunded allweather highways were the only viable longdistance land transportation available in canada for many years as such their operation consumed a great deal of public and political attention many countries regard railway networks as critical infrastructure even to this day and at the time of the creation of cnr during the continuing threat of the first world war canada was not the only country to engage in railway nationalization in the early th century many governments were taking a more interventionist role in the economy foreshadowing the influence of economists like john maynard keynes this political trend combined with broader geopolitical events made nationalization an appealing choice for canada the winnipeg general strike of  and allied involvement in the russian revolution seemed to validate the continuing process the need for a viable rail system was paramount in a time of civil unrest and

a potential alternative to conventional diesel fuel two sd dieselelectric locomotives fuelled with  natural gas and  diesel are in service between edmonton and fort mcmurray alberta recent controversiesedit in december  the ultratrain a petroleum products unit train linking the levis quebec ultramar oil refinery with a petroleum depot in montreal exploded when it collided with a derailed freight train travelling in the opposite direction between saintemadeleine and sainthilaireest south of montreal killing the crew of the freight train the ultratrain crew’s last words were “you guys are derailed we’re hitting you” the other train derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld that was not fixed in time despite being repeatedly reported by train crews the report by the transportation safety board of canada called into question cns quality assurance program for rail welds as well as the lack of detection equipment for defective wheels in memory of the dead crewmen two new stations on the line have been named after them davis and thériault on may   a cn train derailed at  pm north of vermontville highway in potterville michigan the train was hauling a total of  cars thirtyfive of the cars derailed and  of them contained hazmat material nine were carrying propane and two cars carried sulfuric acid two of the propane tankers were leaking and a third was suspected of leaking each propane car contains  gallons of propane gas which is considered an extreme fire and explosive hazard an evacuation of potterville was declared cn along with other agencies worked throughout the week to clean the area a second cn train derailment in potterville michigan occurred in may  though no evacuation was necessary the cause of this derailment was found to be a failed wheel bearing on the nd car about  am central standard time on february   northbound cn freight train m derailed  of its  cars in tamaroa illinois four of the derailed cars released methanol and the methanol from two of these four cars fueled a fire other derailed cars contained phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid formaldehyde and vinyl chloride two cars containing hydrochloric acid one car containing formaldehyde and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire about  residents were evacuated from the area within a mile  km radius of the derailment which included the entire village of tamaroa improper placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions rapidly progressed to rail failure on may   a trestle collapsed under the weight of a freight train near mcbride bc killing both crew members both men had been disciplined earlier for refusing to take another train on the same bridge claiming it was unsafe it was revealed that as far back as  several bridge components had been reported as rotten yet no repairs had been ordered by management eventually the disciplinary records of both crewmen were amended posthumously controversy arose again in canadian political circles in  following the companys decision to refer solely to its acronym cn and not canadian national a move some interpret as being an attempt to distance the company from references to canada canadas minister of transport at the time called this policy move obscene after nationalists noted it could be argued the company is no longer canadian being primarily owned by american stockholders the controversy is somewhat tempered by the fact a majority of large corporations are being increasingly referred to by acronyms in march  a strike by the canadian auto workers union showed deeprooted divisions between organized labour and the companys current management the cn north america logo this was used from – before the company returned to the plain cn logo which is still in use the residents of wabamun lake in alberta staged a blockade of cn tracks in august  when they were unsatisfied with the railways response to a derailment catastrophe that spilled over  litres of tarry fuel oil and about  l of carcinogenic pole treatment oil into the lake reporters found prespill evidence cn executives admitted cn failed to provide public safety information to prevent public exposure to carcinogenic toxic chemicals the tarlike oil and chemicals killed over  large migratory birds animals fish and other aquatic life on august   in the cheakamus river derailment a cn train had nine cars derail on a bridge over the cheakamus river causing  litres  us gal of caustic soda to spill into the river killing thousands of fish by caustic burns and asphyxiation the cbc reported environmental experts say it would take the river  years or more to recover from the toxic pollution cn is facing accusations from local british columbians over the railways supposed lack of response to this issue touted as the worst chemical spill in british columbias history transport canada has restricted cn to trains not exceeding  car lengths because of the multiple derailments on the former bcr line north from squamish this was due to sufficient warnings from the former bc rail to canadian national railway to avoid trains of over  cars unfortunately these warnings were ignored by cn who had been running trains well in excess of  cars on this winding and mountainous section of track known for some of the steepest track in north america a further derailment at moran  miles  km north of lillooet on june   has raised more questions about cns safety policies two more derailments near lytton in august  have continued criticism in the first case  coal cars of a cpr train using a cn bridge derailed dumping  cars of coal into the thompson river in the second case half a dozen grain cars spilled on a cn train two cn trains collided on august   on the banks of the fraser river near prince george bc several cars carrying gasoline diesel and lumber burst into flames water bombers were used to help put out the fires some fuel had seeped into the fraser river on december   a cn train derailed near edmonton in strathcona county alberta at  am mountain standard time of the  cars derailed most of them were empty or carrying nonhazardous materials such as lumber or pipes about  pm central daylight time on friday june   eastbound cn freight train u traveling at  miles per hour  kmh derailed at a highwayrail grade crossing in cherry valley illinois near rockford the train consisted of  locomotives and  cars  of which derailed all of the derailed cars were tank cars carrying denatured fuel ethanol a flammable liquid thirteen of the derailed tank cars were breached or lost product and caught fire at the time of the derailment several motor vehicles were stopped on either side of the grade crossing waiting for the train to pass as a result of the fire that erupted after the derailment a passenger in one of the stopped cars was fatally injured two passengers in the same car received serious injuries and five occupants of other cars waiting at the highwayrail crossing were injured two responding firefighters also sustained minor injuries the release of ethanol and the resulting fire prompted a mandatory evacuation of about  residences within a mile  km radius of the accident site monetary damages were estimated to total  million the probable cause of the accident was the washout of the track structure that was discovered about  hour before the trains arrival and cns failure to notify the train crew of the known washout in time to stop the train because of the inadequacy of cns emergency communication procedures contributing to the accident was the cns failure to work with winnebago county to develop a comprehensive storm water management plan to address the previous washouts in  and  contributing to the severity of the accident was the cns failure to issue the flash flood warning to the train crew and the inadequate design of the dot tank cars which made the cars subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials in the derailment in october  the james street bridge between thunder bay and fort william first nation was subject to an act of arson causing great structural damage to the bridge the bridge was the most direct route between thunder bay and fort william first nation reserve and was used by foot traffic vehicular traffic and rail traffic the matter of who is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the bridge is subject to great controversy between the city of thunder bay and cn due to an agreement dating back to  between the grand trunk pacific railway company later incorporated as cnr along with other railways and the city of fort william later merged with the city of port arthur into the city of thunder bay the  agreement states that the company will give the municipal corporation the perpetual right to cross said bridge for vehicle and foot traffic and that the company will maintain the bridge in perpetuity without cost to the town after the fire cn made repairs to the bridge for use of its rail system but did not repair the damage to the vehicle lanes which render it unsafe for vehicle use cn maintains that the  agreement does not speak to replacement of the bridge while the position of the city of thunder bay is that cn is solely responsible for making the necessary repairs to restore function to the vehicle lanes of the bridge in the years following cns  acquisition of illinois central the company has come under scrutiny for illicit practices that allegedly cause the delay of amtrak schedules in  amtrak filed a formal complaint against cn with the surface transportation board stating that the prioritization of freight traffic over passenger traffic was commonplace on amtrak routes operating on cn lines the complaint cited over  delays during fiscal year  on the route between chicago and carbondale totaling over  days of net wasted schedule time it also reported  of delays between chicago and new orleans on the city of new orleans route were caused by cn dispatching issues corporate governanceedit robert pace is the chair of the cnr board the other board members are donald j carty v maureen kempston

of routes from its constituent railways but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network for example on december   cnr inaugurated the continental limited which operated over four of its predecessors as well as the temiskaming and northern ontario railway the s saw growth in passenger travel and cnr inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services such as radio on its trains however the growth in passenger travel ended with the great depression which lasted between  and  but picked up somewhat in world war ii by the end of world war ii many of cnrs passenger cars were old and worn down accidents at dugald manitoba in  and canoe river british columbia in  wherein extra passenger trains composed of older wooden equipment collided with transcontinental passenger trains composed of newer allsteel equipment demonstrated the dangers inherent in the older cars in  cnr ordered  lightweight passenger cars allowing them to reequip their major routes on april   the same day that the cpr introduced its transcontinental train the canadian cnr introduced its own new transcontinental passenger train the super continental which used new streamlined rolling stock however the super continental was never considered as glamorous as the canadian for example it did not include dome cars dome cars would be added in the early s with the purchase of six former milwaukee road super domes they were used on the super continental in the summer tourist season new servicesedit rail passenger traffic in canada declined significantly between world war ii and  due to automobiles and airplanes in the s cns privately owned rival cpr reduced its passenger services significantly however the governmentowned cn continued much of its passenger services and marketed new schemes one introduced on  april  was the red white and blue fare structure which offered deep discounts on offpeak days red and were credited with increasing passenger numbers on some routes as much as  another exercise was the rebranding of the express trains in the ontario–quebec corridor with the rapido label in  cn introduced a new highspeed train the united aircraft turbo which was powered by gas turbines instead of diesel engines it made the trip between toronto and montreal in four hours but was not entirely successful because it was somewhat uneconomical and not always reliable the trainsets were retired in  and later scrapped at metrecy in laval quebec on cns narrow gauge lines in newfoundland cn also operated a main line passenger train that ran from st johns to port aux basques called the caribou nicknamed the newfie bullett this train ran until june  it was replaced by the cn roadcruiser buses the cn roadcruiser service was started in fall  and was run in direct competition with the companys own passenger train travellers saw that the buses could travel between st johns and port aux basques in  hours versus the trains  hours after the demise of the caribou the only passenger train service run by cn on the island were the mixed freight and passenger trains that ran on the bonavista carbonear and argentia branch lines the only passenger service surviving on the main line was between bishops falls and corner brook in  cn created an entity called viacn as a separate operating unit for its passenger services via evolved into a coordinated marketing effort with cp rail for rail passenger services and later into a separate crown corporation responsible for intercity passenger services in canada via rail took over cns passenger services on april   declineedit cn continued to fund its commuter rail services in montreal until  when the montreal urban community transit commission muctc assumed financial responsibility for them operation was contracted out to cn which eventually spun off a separate subsidiary montrain for this purpose when the montreal–deuxmontagnes line was completely rebuilt in – the new rolling stock came under the ownership of the muctc until a separate government agency the agence métropolitaine de transport amt was set up to consolidate all suburban transit administration around montreal since then suburban service has resumed to sainthilaire and a new line to mascouche opened in december  in newfoundland terra transport would continue to operate the mixed trains on the branch lines until  the main line run between corner brook and bishops falls made its last run on september   terra transportcn would run the roadcruiser bus service until march   whereupon the bus service was sold off to drl

excursion that runs from sault ste marie ontario north to the agawa canyon the canyon tour train consists of up to  passenger cars and  dining cars the majority of which were built for cn by canadian car and foundry in – these cars were transferred to the drgw ski train and bought back by cn in  after cn acquired bc rail in  it started operating a railbus service between seton portage and lillooet british columbia called the kaoham shuttle cn crews used to operate commuter trains on behalf of go transit in the toronto and the surrounding vicinity this changed in  when a deal was reached with bombardier transportation that switched all cn crews for bombardier crews in january  cn announced it was cutting the service from sault ste marie to hearst blaming the canadian federal government for cutting a subsidy necessary to keep the service running it has been argued in the past as an essential service however the service has always been deemed financially uneconomic despite an extension of funding in april  algoma central service was suspended as of july  locomotivesedit steamedit cn steam locomotive at head lake haliburton ontario cn  at guelph ontario the cnr acquired its first  confederation locomotives in  over the next  years it ordered over  for passenger and heavy freight service the cnr also used several  mountain locomotives almost exclusively for passenger service no  a streamlined  was the last cn steam locomotive running in excursion service in the s cnr also used several  mikado locomotives electricedit first and last cn electric locomotive – cn inherited from the canadian northern railway several boxcab electrics used through the mount royal tunnel those were built between  and  by general electric in schenectady new york to operate the new montreal central station which opened in  and was to be kept free of locomotive smoke they were supplemented by nearly identical locomotives from the national harbours board those engines were built in  by beyergarratt and englishelectric in  three general electric centrecab electric locomotives were added to the fleet in  cn added electric multiple units built by canadian car and foundry electrification was restricted to montreal and went from central station to saintlambert south turcot west montréalnord east and sainteustachesurlelac later renamed deuxmontagnes north but as steam locomotives gave way to diesels engine changeovers were no longer necessary and catenary was eventually pulled from the west east and from the south however until the end of the original electrification cns electric locomotives pulled via rails trains including its diesel electric locomotives to and from central station the last  v dc cn electric locomotive ran on june   the very same locomotive that pulled the inaugural train through the mount royal tunnel back in  later in  the amts electric multiple units began operating under  kv ac  hz electrification and in  dualpower locomotives entered service on the mascouche line turboedit in may  canadian national railways ordered five sevencar uac turbotrain for the montreal–toronto service it planned to operate them in tandem connecting two trains together into a larger fourteencar arrangement with a total capacity of  passengers the canadian trains were built by montreal locomotive works with their st engines supplied by uacs canadian division now prattwhitney canada in longueuil quebec cn and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit so they dropped the train from the name in cns marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the turbo although it retained the full turbotrain name in cns own documentation and communication with uac a goal of cns marketing campaign was to get the train into service for expo  and the turbo was rushed through its trials it was late for expo a disappointment to all involved but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing the turbos first demonstration run in december  with conductor james abbey of toronto in command included a large press contingent an hour into its debut run the turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near kingston the turbos final run was on october   dieseledit in  the cnr made its first experiment with diesel electric locomotives acquiring two from westinghouse numbered  and  it was the first north american railway to use diesels in mainline service these early units proved the feasibility of the diesel concept but were not always reliable no  served until  and no  until  the difficulties of the great depression precluded much further progress towards diesel locomotives the cnr began its conversion to diesel locomotives after world war ii and had fully dieselized by  most of the cnrs firstgeneration diesel locomotives were made by general motors diesel gmd and montreal locomotive works for its narrowgauge lines in newfoundland cn acquired from gmd the  series models nf road numbers – and nf road numbers – for use on the branch lines cn purchased the emd g road numbers – for passenger service the cnr acquired gmd fp diesels as well as clc cpa alco mlw fpa and fpa diesels these locomotives made up most of the cnrs passenger fleet although cn also owned some  railliners budd rail diesel cars some dualpurpose diesel freight locomotives freight locomotives equipped with passenger train apparatus such as steam generators as well as the locomotives for the turbo trainsets via acquired most of cns passenger fleet when it took over cn passenger service in  the cn fleet as of update consists of  locomotives most of which are products of either general motors electromotive division emd or general electricge transportation systems some locomotives more than  years old remain in service much of the current roster is made up of emd sdi and emd sdi locomotives and ge cw locomotives recently acquired are the new emd sdm and ge esdc beginning in the early summer months of  cn purchased a small order of ge cs and ge cws from union pacific and bnsf railway respectively the intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative cn currently have  ge esacs on its roster and all  were ordered and delivered from december december  they are cns first acpowered locomotives comfort cab cn locomotives have long featured unique features unlike the stock emd and ge locomotives cn introduced a widenosed four window comfort cab the predecessor to the now standard north american safety cab which is now standard on new north american freight locomotives cn train at east junction edmonton  ditch lights after a bc derailment cn introduced ditch lights lights mounted on or just below the anticlimbers on the front pilot of a locomotive these are used to make trains more visible at gradecrossings and to give better visibility around curves since then ditch lights have become standard features on all north american locomotives class and marker lights cn continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years up to as recently as the cm and sdf which feature red green and white class lights and the first order cwl locomotives which retained white class lights more recently cn has had red marker lights installed on their esdc and sdm locomotives for use when the locomotives are in dpu service windshields cns first few orders of esdcs like their cws feature teardrop windshields windshields with the outer lower corner dropped like earlier sdis as opposed to the standard rectangular ge windshield for better range of vision headlights the first order of sdm locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab while the second order  series dropped the headlight to the nose and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab control stands while many railroads have ordered new desktop controls where the controls are arranged on a desk—cn returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally this arrangement makes reverse operation easier and allows engineers to put their feet up without feeling stuck at a desk all day car body cns general motors sdf sdf retired bombardier hrs and general electric cm feature a fullwidth car body that is tapered directly behind the cab to allow for better rear visibility this is referred to as a draper taper after its creator the first

railway peir among others on december   the federal government created the canadian national railways cnr – a title only with no corporate powers – through a canadian privy council order in council as

october   finally the bankrupt gtr itself was placed under the care of a federal government board of management on may   while gtr management and shareholders opposed to nationalization took legal action after several years of arbitration the gtr was absorbed into cnr on january   in subsequent years several smaller independent railways would be added to the cnr as they went bankrupt or it became politically expedient to do so however the system was more or less finalized following the addition of the gtr canadian national railways was born out of both wartime and domestic urgency railways until the rise of the personal automobile and creation of taxpayerfunded allweather highways were the only viable longdistance land transportation available in canada for many years as such their operation consumed a great deal of public and political attention many countries regard railway networks as critical infrastructure even to this day and at the time of the creation of cnr during the continuing threat of the first world war canada was not the only country to engage in railway nationalization in the early th century many governments were taking a more interventionist role in the economy foreshadowing the influence of economists like john maynard keynes this political trend combined with broader geopolitical events made nationalization an appealing choice for canada the winnipeg general strike of  and allied involvement in the russian revolution seemed to validate the continuing process the need for a viable rail system was paramount in a time of civil unrest and

the derailment which included the entire village of tamaroa improper placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars where untempered martensite associated with the

these warnings were ignored by cn who had been running trains well in excess of  cars on this winding and mountainous section of track known for some of the steepest track in north america a further derailment at moran  miles  km north of lillooet on june   has raised more questions about cns safety policies two more derailments near lytton in august  have continued criticism in the first case  coal cars of a cpr train using a cn bridge derailed dumping  cars of coal into the thompson river in the second case half a dozen grain cars spilled on a cn train two cn trains collided on august   on the banks of the fraser river near prince george bc several cars carrying gasoline diesel and lumber burst into flames water bombers were used to help put out the fires some fuel had seeped into the fraser river on december   a cn train derailed near edmonton in strathcona county alberta at  am mountain standard time of the  cars derailed most of them were empty or carrying nonhazardous materials such as lumber or pipes about  pm central daylight time on friday june   eastbound cn freight train u traveling at  miles per hour  kmh derailed at a highwayrail grade crossing in cherry valley illinois near rockford the train consisted of  locomotives and  cars  of which derailed all of the derailed cars were tank cars carrying denatured fuel ethanol a flammable liquid thirteen of the derailed tank cars were breached or lost product and caught fire at the time of the derailment several motor vehicles were stopped on either side of the grade crossing waiting for the train to pass as a result of the fire that erupted after the derailment a passenger in one of the stopped cars was fatally injured two passengers in the same car received serious injuries and five occupants of other cars waiting at the highwayrail crossing were injured two responding firefighters also sustained minor injuries the release of ethanol and the resulting fire prompted a mandatory evacuation of about  residences within a mile  km radius of the accident site monetary damages were estimated to total  million the probable cause of the accident was the washout of the track structure that was discovered about  hour before the trains arrival and cns failure to notify the train crew of the known washout in time to stop the train because of the inadequacy of cns emergency communication procedures contributing to the accident was the cns failure to work with winnebago county to develop a comprehensive storm water management plan to address the previous washouts in  and  contributing to the severity of the accident was the cns failure to issue the flash flood warning to the train crew and the inadequate design of the dot tank cars which made the cars subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials in the derailment in october  the james street bridge between thunder bay and fort william first nation was subject to an act of arson causing great structural damage to the bridge the bridge was the most direct route between thunder bay and fort william first nation reserve and was used by foot traffic vehicular traffic and rail traffic the matter of who is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the bridge is subject to great controversy between the city of thunder bay and cn due to an agreement dating back to  between the grand trunk pacific railway company later incorporated as cnr along with other railways and the city of fort william later merged with the city of port arthur into the city of thunder bay the  agreement states that the company will give the municipal corporation the perpetual right to cross said bridge for vehicle and foot traffic and that the company will maintain the bridge in perpetuity without cost to the town after the fire cn made repairs to the bridge for use of its rail system but did not repair the damage to the vehicle lanes which render it unsafe for vehicle use cn maintains that the  agreement does not speak to replacement of the bridge while the position of the city of thunder bay is that cn is solely responsible for making the necessary repairs to restore function to the vehicle lanes of the bridge in the years following cns  acquisition of illinois central the company has come under scrutiny for illicit practices that allegedly cause the delay of amtrak schedules in  amtrak filed a formal complaint against cn with the surface transportation board stating that the prioritization of freight traffic over passenger traffic was commonplace on amtrak routes operating on cn lines the complaint cited over  delays during fiscal year  on the route between chicago and carbondale totaling over  days of net wasted schedule time it also reported  of delays between chicago and new orleans on the city of new orleans route were caused by cn dispatching issues corporate governanceedit robert pace is the chair of the cnr board the other board members are donald j carty v maureen kempston

jobin  as president and chief executive officer thornton and harrison are the only noncanadians to head cn passenger trainsedit early yearsedit when cnr was first created it inherited a large number of routes from its constituent railways but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network for example on december   cnr inaugurated the continental limited which operated over four of its predecessors as well as the temiskaming and northern ontario railway the s saw growth in passenger travel and cnr inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services such as radio on its trains however the growth in passenger travel ended with the great depression which lasted between  and  but picked up somewhat in world war ii by the end of world war ii many of cnrs passenger cars were old and worn down accidents at dugald manitoba in  and canoe river british columbia in  wherein extra passenger trains composed of older wooden equipment collided with transcontinental passenger trains composed of newer allsteel equipment demonstrated the dangers inherent in the older cars in  cnr ordered  lightweight passenger cars allowing them to reequip their major routes on april   the same day that the cpr introduced its transcontinental train the canadian cnr introduced its own new transcontinental passenger train the super continental which used new streamlined rolling stock however the super continental was never considered as glamorous as the canadian for example it did not include dome cars dome cars would be added in the early s with the purchase of six former milwaukee road super domes they were used on the super continental in the summer tourist season new servicesedit rail passenger traffic in canada declined significantly between world war ii and  due to automobiles and airplanes in the s cns privately owned rival cpr reduced its passenger services significantly however the governmentowned cn continued much of its passenger services and marketed new schemes one introduced on  april  was the red white and blue fare structure which offered deep discounts on offpeak days red and were credited with increasing passenger numbers on some routes as much as  another exercise was the rebranding of the express trains in the ontario–quebec corridor with the rapido label in  cn introduced a new highspeed train the united aircraft turbo which was powered by gas turbines instead of diesel engines it made the trip between toronto and montreal in four hours but was not entirely successful because it was somewhat uneconomical and not always reliable the trainsets were retired in  and later scrapped at metrecy in laval quebec on cns narrow gauge lines in newfoundland cn also operated a main line passenger train that ran from st johns to port aux basques called the caribou nicknamed the newfie bullett this train ran until june  it was replaced by the cn roadcruiser buses the cn roadcruiser service was started in fall  and was run in direct competition with the companys own passenger train travellers saw that the buses could travel between st johns and port aux basques in  hours versus the trains  hours after the demise of the caribou the only passenger train service run by cn on the island were the mixed freight and passenger trains that ran on the bonavista carbonear and argentia branch lines the only passenger service surviving on the main line was between bishops falls and corner brook in  cn created an entity called viacn as a separate operating unit for its passenger services via evolved into a coordinated marketing effort with cp rail for rail passenger services and later into a separate crown corporation responsible for intercity passenger services in canada via rail took over cns passenger services on april   declineedit cn continued to fund its commuter rail services in montreal until  when the montreal urban community transit commission muctc assumed financial responsibility for them operation was contracted out to cn which eventually spun off a separate subsidiary montrain for this purpose when the montreal–deuxmontagnes line was completely rebuilt in – the new rolling stock came under the ownership of the muctc until a separate government agency the agence métropolitaine de transport amt was set up to consolidate all suburban transit administration around montreal since then suburban service has resumed to sainthilaire and a new line to mascouche opened in december  in newfoundland terra transport would continue to operate the mixed trains on the branch lines until  the main line run between corner brook and bishops falls made its last run on september   terra transportcn would run the roadcruiser bus service until march   whereupon the bus service was sold off to drl coachlines of triton newfoundland expansion and service cutsedit cn operates the agawa canyon tour excursion since acquiring the algoma central railway in  cn operated passenger service between sault ste marie and hearst ontario the passenger service operated three days per week provides yearround access to remote tourist camps and resorts also cn operates the agawa canyon tour excursion an excursion that runs from sault ste marie ontario north to the agawa canyon the canyon tour train consists of up to  passenger cars and  dining cars the majority of which were built for cn by canadian car and foundry in – these cars were transferred to the drgw ski train and bought back by cn in  after cn acquired bc rail in  it started operating a railbus service between seton portage and lillooet british columbia called the kaoham shuttle cn crews used to operate commuter trains on behalf of go transit in the toronto and the surrounding vicinity this changed in  when a deal was reached with bombardier transportation that switched all cn crews for bombardier crews in january  cn announced it was cutting the service from sault ste marie to hearst blaming the canadian federal government for cutting a subsidy necessary to keep the service running it has been argued in the past as an essential service however the service has always been deemed financially uneconomic despite an extension of funding in april  algoma central service was suspended as of july  locomotivesedit steamedit cn steam locomotive at head lake haliburton ontario cn  at guelph ontario the cnr acquired its first  confederation locomotives in  over the next  years it ordered over  for passenger and heavy freight service the cnr also used several  mountain locomotives almost exclusively for passenger service no  a streamlined  was the last cn steam locomotive running in excursion service in the s cnr also used several  mikado locomotives electricedit first and last cn electric locomotive – cn inherited from the canadian northern railway several boxcab electrics used through the mount royal tunnel those were built between  and  by general electric in schenectady new york to operate the new montreal central station which opened in  and was to be kept free of locomotive smoke they were supplemented by nearly identical locomotives from the national harbours board those engines were built in  by beyergarratt and englishelectric in  three general electric centrecab electric locomotives were added to the fleet in  cn added electric multiple units built by canadian car and foundry electrification was restricted to montreal and went from central station to saintlambert south turcot west montréalnord east and sainteustachesurlelac later renamed deuxmontagnes north but as steam locomotives gave way to diesels engine changeovers were no longer necessary and catenary was eventually pulled from the west east and from the south however until the end of the original electrification cns electric locomotives pulled via rails trains including its diesel electric locomotives to and from central station the last  v dc cn electric locomotive ran on june   the very same locomotive that pulled the inaugural train through the mount royal tunnel back in  later in  the amts electric multiple units began operating under  kv ac  hz electrification and in  dualpower locomotives entered service on the mascouche line turboedit in may  canadian national railways ordered five sevencar uac turbotrain for the montreal–toronto service it planned to operate them in tandem connecting two trains together into a larger fourteencar arrangement with a total capacity of  passengers the canadian trains were built by montreal locomotive works with their st engines supplied by uacs canadian division now prattwhitney canada in longueuil quebec cn and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit so they dropped the train from the name in cns marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the turbo although it retained the full turbotrain name in cns own documentation and communication with uac a goal of cns marketing campaign was to get the train into service for expo  and the turbo was rushed through its trials it was late for expo a disappointment to all involved but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing the turbos first demonstration run in december  with conductor james abbey of toronto in command included a large press contingent an hour into its debut run the turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near kingston the turbos final run was on october   dieseledit in  the cnr made its first experiment with diesel electric locomotives acquiring two from westinghouse numbered  and  it was the first north american railway to use diesels in mainline service these early units proved the feasibility of the diesel concept but were not always reliable no  served until  and no  until  the difficulties of the great depression precluded much further progress towards diesel locomotives the cnr began its conversion to diesel locomotives after world war ii and had fully dieselized by  most of the cnrs firstgeneration diesel locomotives were made by general motors diesel gmd and montreal locomotive works for its narrowgauge lines in newfoundland cn acquired from gmd the  series models nf road numbers – and nf road numbers – for use on the branch lines cn purchased the emd g road numbers – for passenger service the cnr acquired gmd fp diesels as well as clc cpa alco mlw fpa and fpa diesels these locomotives made up most of the cnrs passenger fleet although cn also owned some  railliners budd rail diesel cars some dualpurpose diesel freight locomotives freight locomotives equipped with passenger train apparatus such as steam generators as well as the locomotives for the turbo trainsets via acquired most of cns passenger fleet when it took over cn passenger service in  the cn fleet as of update consists of  locomotives most of which are products of either general motors electromotive division emd or general electricge transportation systems some locomotives more than  years old remain in service much of the current roster is made up of emd sdi and emd sdi locomotives and ge cw locomotives recently acquired are the new emd sdm and ge esdc beginning in the early summer months of  cn purchased a small order of ge cs and ge cws from union pacific and bnsf railway respectively the intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative cn currently have  ge esacs on its roster and all  were ordered and delivered from december december  they are cns first acpowered locomotives comfort cab cn locomotives have long featured unique features unlike the stock emd and ge locomotives cn introduced a widenosed four window comfort cab the predecessor to the now standard north american safety cab which is now standard on new north american freight locomotives cn train at east junction edmonton  ditch lights after a bc derailment cn introduced ditch lights lights mounted on or just below the anticlimbers on the front pilot of a locomotive these are used to make trains more visible at gradecrossings and to give better visibility around curves since then ditch lights have become standard features on all north american locomotives class and marker lights cn continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years up to as recently as the cm and sdf which feature red green and white class lights and the first order cwl locomotives which retained white class lights more recently cn has had red marker lights installed on their esdc and sdm locomotives for use when the locomotives are in dpu service windshields cns first few orders of esdcs like their cws feature teardrop windshields windshields with the outer lower corner dropped like earlier sdis as opposed to the standard rectangular ge windshield for better range of vision headlights the first order of sdm locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab while the second order  series dropped the headlight to the nose and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab control stands while many railroads have ordered new desktop controls where the controls are arranged on a desk—cn returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally this arrangement makes reverse operation easier and allows engineers to put their feet up without feeling stuck at a desk all day car body cns general motors sdf sdf retired bombardier hrs and general electric cm feature a fullwidth car body that is tapered directly behind the cab to allow for better rear visibility this is referred to as a draper taper after its creator the first order of the ge c – was also initially an order for  locomotives with the fullwidth draper taper car body they were changed to a standard long hood with a cnstyle fourwindow cab and the order was

also directed to assume management of canadian government railways cgr a system comprising the intercolonial railway of canada irc national transcontinental railway ntr and the prince edward island railway peir among others on december   the federal government created the canadian national railways cnr – a title only with no corporate powers – through a canadian privy council order in council as a means to simplify the funding and operation of the various railway companies the absorption of the intercolonial railway would see cnr adopt that systems slogan the peoples railway another canadian

government the federal governments department of railways and canals took over operation of the gtpr until july   when it too was placed under the cnr the canadian national railway was organized on october   finally the bankrupt gtr itself was placed under the care of a federal government board of management on may   while gtr management and shareholders opposed to nationalization took legal action after several years of arbitration the gtr was absorbed into cnr on january   in subsequent years several smaller independent railways would be added to the cnr as they went bankrupt or it became politically expedient to do so however the system was more or less finalized following the addition of the gtr canadian national railways was born out of both wartime and domestic urgency railways until the rise of the personal automobile and creation of taxpayerfunded allweather highways were the only viable longdistance land transportation available in canada for many years as such their operation consumed a great deal of public and political attention many countries regard railway networks as critical infrastructure even to this day and at the time of the creation of cnr during the continuing threat of the first world war canada was not the only country to engage in railway nationalization in the early th century many governments were taking a more interventionist role in the economy foreshadowing the influence of economists like john maynard keynes this political trend combined with broader geopolitical events made nationalization an appealing choice for canada the winnipeg general strike of  and allied involvement in the russian revolution seemed to validate the continuing process the need for a viable rail system was paramount in a time of civil unrest and

derailed freight train travelling in the opposite direction between saintemadeleine and sainthilaireest south of montreal killing the crew of the freight train the ultratrain crew’s last words were “you guys are derailed we’re hitting you” the other train derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld that was not fixed in time despite being repeatedly reported by train crews the report by

acid one car containing formaldehyde and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire about  residents were evacuated from the area within a mile  km radius of the derailment which included the entire village of tamaroa improper placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions rapidly progressed to rail failure on may   a trestle collapsed under the

distance the company from references to canada canadas minister of transport at the time called this policy move obscene after nationalists noted it could be argued the company is no longer canadian being primarily owned by american stockholders the controversy is somewhat tempered by the fact a majority of large corporations are being increasingly referred to by acronyms in march  a strike by

illinois near rockford the train consisted of  locomotives and  cars  of which derailed all of the derailed cars were tank cars carrying denatured fuel ethanol a flammable liquid thirteen of the derailed tank cars were breached or lost product and caught fire at the time of the derailment several motor vehicles were stopped on either side of the grade crossing waiting for the train to pass as a result of the fire that erupted after the derailment a passenger in one of the stopped cars was fatally injured two passengers in the same car received serious injuries and five occupants of other cars waiting at the highwayrail crossing were injured two responding firefighters also sustained minor injuries the release of ethanol and the resulting fire prompted a mandatory evacuation of about  residences within a mile  km radius of the accident site monetary damages were estimated to total  million the probable cause of the accident was the washout of the track structure that was discovered about  hour before the trains arrival and cns failure to notify the train crew of the known washout in time to stop the train because of the inadequacy of cns emergency communication procedures contributing to the accident was the cns failure to work with winnebago county to develop a comprehensive storm water management plan to address the previous washouts in  and  contributing to the severity of the accident was the cns failure to issue the flash flood warning to the train crew and the inadequate design of the dot tank cars which made the cars subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials in the derailment in october  the james street bridge between thunder bay and fort william first nation was subject to an act of arson causing great structural damage to the bridge the bridge was the most direct route between thunder bay and fort william first nation reserve and was used by foot traffic vehicular traffic and rail traffic the matter of who is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the bridge is subject to great controversy between the city of thunder bay and cn due to an agreement dating back to  between the grand trunk pacific railway company later incorporated as cnr along with other railways and the city of fort william later merged with the city of port arthur into the city of thunder bay the  agreement states that the company will give the municipal corporation the perpetual right to cross said bridge for vehicle and foot traffic and that the company will maintain the bridge in perpetuity without cost to the town after the fire cn made repairs to the bridge for use of its rail system but did not repair the damage to the vehicle lanes which render it unsafe for vehicle use cn maintains that the  agreement does not speak to replacement of the bridge while the position of the city of thunder bay is that cn is solely responsible for making the necessary repairs to restore function to the vehicle lanes of the bridge in the years following cns  acquisition of illinois central the company has come under scrutiny for illicit practices that allegedly cause the delay of amtrak schedules in  amtrak filed a formal complaint against cn with the surface transportation board stating that the prioritization of freight traffic over passenger traffic was commonplace on amtrak routes operating on cn lines the

jobin  as president and chief executive officer thornton and harrison are the only noncanadians to head cn passenger trainsedit early yearsedit when cnr was first created it inherited a large number of routes from its constituent railways but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network for example on december   cnr inaugurated the continental limited which operated over four of its predecessors as well as the temiskaming and northern ontario railway the s saw growth in passenger travel and cnr inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services such as radio on its trains however the growth in passenger travel ended with the great depression which lasted between  and  but picked up somewhat in world war ii by the end of world war ii many of cnrs passenger cars were old and worn down accidents at dugald manitoba in  and canoe river british columbia in  wherein extra passenger trains composed of older wooden equipment collided with transcontinental passenger trains composed of newer allsteel equipment demonstrated the dangers inherent in the older cars in  cnr ordered  lightweight passenger cars allowing them to reequip their major routes on april   the same day that the cpr introduced its transcontinental train the canadian cnr introduced its own new transcontinental passenger train the super continental which used new streamlined rolling stock however the super continental was never considered as glamorous as the canadian for example it did not include dome cars dome cars would be added in the early s with the purchase of six former milwaukee road super domes they were used on the super continental in the summer tourist season new servicesedit rail passenger traffic in canada declined significantly between world war ii and  due to automobiles and airplanes in the s cns privately owned rival cpr reduced its passenger services significantly however the governmentowned cn continued much of its passenger services and marketed new schemes one introduced on  april  was the red white and blue fare structure which offered deep discounts on offpeak days red and were credited with increasing passenger numbers on some routes as much as  another exercise was the rebranding of the express trains in the ontario–quebec corridor with the rapido label in  cn introduced a new highspeed train the united aircraft turbo which was powered by gas turbines instead of diesel engines it made the trip between toronto and montreal in four hours but was not entirely successful because it was somewhat uneconomical and not always reliable the trainsets were retired in  and later scrapped at metrecy in laval quebec on cns narrow gauge lines in newfoundland cn also operated a main line passenger train that ran from st johns to port aux basques called the caribou nicknamed the newfie bullett this train ran until june  it was replaced by the cn roadcruiser buses the cn roadcruiser service was started in fall  and was run in direct competition with the companys own passenger train travellers saw that the buses could travel between st johns and port aux basques in  hours versus the trains  hours after the demise of the caribou the only passenger train service run by cn on the island were the mixed freight and passenger trains that ran on the bonavista carbonear and argentia branch lines the only passenger service surviving on the main line was between bishops falls and corner brook in  cn created an entity called viacn as a separate operating unit for its passenger services via evolved into a coordinated marketing effort with cp rail for rail passenger services and later into a separate crown corporation responsible for intercity passenger services in canada via rail took over cns passenger services on april   declineedit cn continued to fund its commuter rail services in montreal until  when the montreal urban community transit commission muctc assumed financial responsibility for them operation was contracted out to cn which eventually spun off a separate subsidiary montrain for this purpose when the montreal–deuxmontagnes line was completely rebuilt in – the new rolling stock came under the ownership of the muctc until a separate government agency the agence métropolitaine de transport amt was set up to consolidate all suburban transit administration around montreal since then suburban service has resumed to sainthilaire and a new line to mascouche opened in december  in newfoundland terra transport would continue to operate the mixed trains on the branch lines until  the main line run between corner brook and bishops falls made its last run on september   terra transportcn would run the roadcruiser bus service until march   whereupon the bus service was sold off to drl coachlines of triton newfoundland expansion and service cutsedit cn operates the agawa canyon tour excursion since acquiring the algoma central railway in  cn operated passenger service between sault ste marie and hearst ontario the passenger service operated three days per week provides yearround access to remote tourist camps and resorts also cn operates the agawa canyon tour excursion an excursion that runs from sault ste marie ontario north to the agawa canyon the canyon tour train consists of up to  passenger cars and  dining cars the majority of which were built for cn by canadian car and foundry in – these cars were transferred to the drgw ski train and bought back by cn in  after cn acquired bc rail in  it started operating a railbus service between seton portage and lillooet british columbia called the kaoham shuttle cn crews used to operate commuter trains on behalf of go transit in the toronto and the surrounding vicinity this changed in  when a deal was reached with bombardier transportation that switched all cn crews for bombardier crews in january  cn announced it was cutting the service from sault ste marie to hearst blaming the canadian federal government for cutting a subsidy necessary to keep the service running it has been argued in the past as an essential service however the service has always been deemed financially uneconomic despite an extension of funding in april  algoma central service was suspended as of july  locomotivesedit steamedit cn steam locomotive at head lake haliburton ontario cn  at guelph ontario the cnr acquired its first  confederation locomotives in  over the next  years it ordered over  for passenger and heavy freight service the cnr also used several  mountain locomotives almost exclusively for passenger service no  a streamlined  was the last cn steam locomotive running in excursion service in the s cnr also used several  mikado locomotives electricedit first and last cn electric locomotive – cn inherited from the canadian northern railway several boxcab electrics used through the mount royal tunnel those were built between  and  by general electric in schenectady new york to operate the new montreal central station which opened in  and was to be kept free of locomotive smoke they were supplemented by nearly identical locomotives from the national harbours board those engines were built in  by beyergarratt and englishelectric in  three general electric centrecab electric locomotives were added to the fleet in  cn added electric multiple units built by canadian car and foundry electrification was restricted to montreal and went from central station to saintlambert south turcot west montréalnord east and sainteustachesurlelac later renamed deuxmontagnes north but as steam locomotives gave way to diesels engine changeovers were no longer necessary and catenary was eventually pulled from the west east and from the south however until the end of the original electrification cns electric locomotives pulled via rails trains including its diesel electric locomotives to and from central station the last  v dc cn electric locomotive ran on june   the very same locomotive that pulled the inaugural train through the mount royal tunnel back in  later in  the amts electric multiple units began operating under  kv ac  hz electrification and in  dualpower locomotives entered service on the mascouche line turboedit in may  canadian national railways ordered five sevencar uac turbotrain for the montreal–toronto service it planned to operate them in tandem connecting two trains together into a larger fourteencar arrangement with a total capacity of  passengers the canadian trains were built by montreal locomotive works with their st engines supplied by uacs canadian division now prattwhitney canada in longueuil quebec cn and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit so they dropped the train from the name in cns marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the turbo although it retained the full turbotrain name in cns own documentation and communication with uac a goal of cns marketing campaign was to get the train into service for expo  and the turbo was rushed through its trials it was late for expo a disappointment to all involved but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing the turbos first demonstration run in december  with conductor james abbey of toronto in command included a large press contingent an hour into its debut run the turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near kingston the turbos final run was on october   dieseledit in  the cnr made its first experiment with diesel electric locomotives acquiring two from westinghouse numbered  and  it was the first north american railway to use diesels in mainline service these early units proved the feasibility of the diesel concept but were not always reliable no  served until  and no  until  the difficulties of the great depression precluded much further progress towards diesel locomotives the cnr began its conversion to diesel locomotives after world war ii and had fully dieselized by  most of the cnrs firstgeneration diesel locomotives were made by general motors diesel gmd and montreal locomotive works for its narrowgauge lines in newfoundland cn acquired from gmd the  series models nf road numbers – and nf road numbers – for use on the branch lines cn purchased the emd g road numbers – for passenger service the cnr acquired gmd fp diesels as well as clc cpa alco mlw fpa and fpa diesels these locomotives made up most of the cnrs passenger fleet although cn also owned some  railliners budd rail diesel cars some dualpurpose diesel freight locomotives freight locomotives equipped with passenger train apparatus such as steam generators as well as the locomotives for the turbo trainsets via acquired most of cns passenger fleet when it took over cn passenger service in  the cn fleet as of update consists of  locomotives most of which are products of either general motors electromotive division emd or general electricge transportation systems some locomotives more than  years old remain in service much of the current roster is made up of emd sdi and emd sdi locomotives and ge cw locomotives recently acquired are the new emd sdm and ge esdc beginning in the early summer months of  cn purchased a small order of ge cs and ge cws from union pacific and bnsf railway respectively the intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative cn currently have  ge esacs on its roster and all  were ordered and delivered from december december  they are cns first acpowered locomotives comfort cab cn locomotives have long featured unique features unlike the stock emd and ge locomotives cn introduced a widenosed four window comfort cab the predecessor to the now standard north american safety cab which is now standard on new north american freight locomotives cn train at east junction edmonton  ditch lights after a bc derailment cn introduced ditch lights lights mounted on or just below the anticlimbers on the front pilot of a locomotive these are used to make trains more visible at gradecrossings and to give better visibility around curves since then ditch lights have become standard features on all north american locomotives class and marker lights cn continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years up to as recently as the cm and sdf which feature red green and white class lights and the first order cwl locomotives which retained white class lights more recently cn has had red marker lights installed on their esdc and sdm locomotives for use when the locomotives are in dpu service windshields cns first few orders of esdcs like their cws feature teardrop windshields windshields with the outer lower corner dropped like earlier sdis as opposed to the standard rectangular ge windshield for better range of vision headlights the first order of sdm locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab while the second order  series dropped the headlight to the nose and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab control stands while many railroads have ordered new desktop controls where the controls are arranged on a desk—cn returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally this arrangement makes reverse operation easier and allows engineers to put their feet up without feeling stuck at a desk all day car body cns general motors sdf sdf retired bombardier hrs and general electric cm feature a fullwidth car body that is tapered directly behind the cab to allow for better rear visibility this is referred to as a draper taper after its creator the first order of the ge c – was also initially an order for  locomotives with the fullwidth draper taper car body they were changed to a standard long hood with a cnstyle fourwindow cab and the order was

about  hour before the trains arrival and cns failure to notify the train crew of the known washout in time to stop the train because of the inadequacy of cns emergency communication procedures contributing to the accident was the cns failure to work with winnebago county to develop a comprehensive storm water management plan to address the previous washouts in  and  contributing to the

trains however the growth in passenger travel ended with the great depression which lasted between  and  but picked up somewhat in world war ii by the end of world war ii many of cnrs passenger cars were old and worn down accidents at dugald manitoba in  and canoe river british columbia in  wherein extra passenger trains composed of older wooden equipment collided with transcontinental passenger trains composed of newer allsteel equipment demonstrated the dangers inherent in the older cars in  cnr ordered  lightweight passenger cars allowing them to reequip their major routes on april   the

british columbia called the kaoham shuttle cn crews used to operate commuter trains on behalf of go transit in the toronto and the surrounding vicinity this changed in  when a deal was reached with bombardier transportation that switched all cn crews for bombardier crews in january  cn announced it was cutting the service from sault ste marie to hearst blaming the canadian federal government for cutting a subsidy necessary to keep the service running it has been argued in the past as an essential service however the service has always been deemed financially uneconomic despite an extension of funding in april  algoma central service was suspended as of july  locomotivesedit steamedit cn steam locomotive at head lake haliburton ontario cn  at guelph ontario the cnr acquired its first  confederation locomotives in  over the next  years it ordered over  for passenger and heavy freight service the cnr also used several  mountain locomotives almost exclusively for passenger service no  a streamlined  was the last cn steam locomotive running in excursion service in the s cnr also used several  mikado locomotives electricedit first and last cn electric locomotive – cn inherited from the canadian northern railway several boxcab electrics used through the mount royal tunnel those were built between  and  by general electric in schenectady new york to operate the new montreal central station which opened in  and was to be kept free of locomotive smoke they were supplemented by nearly identical locomotives from the national harbours board those engines were built in  by beyergarratt and englishelectric in  three general electric centrecab electric locomotives were added to the fleet in  cn added electric multiple units built by canadian car and foundry electrification was restricted to montreal and went from central station to saintlambert south turcot west montréalnord east and sainteustachesurlelac later renamed deuxmontagnes north but as steam locomotives gave way to diesels engine changeovers were no longer necessary and catenary was eventually pulled from the west east and from the south however until the end of the original electrification cns electric locomotives pulled via rails trains including its diesel electric locomotives to and from central station the last  v dc cn electric locomotive ran on june   the very same locomotive that pulled the inaugural train through the mount royal tunnel back in  later in  the amts electric multiple units began operating under  kv ac  hz electrification and in  dualpower locomotives entered service on the mascouche line turboedit in may  canadian national railways ordered five sevencar uac turbotrain for the montreal–toronto service it planned to operate them in tandem connecting two trains together into a larger fourteencar arrangement with a total capacity of  passengers the canadian trains were built by montreal locomotive works with their st engines supplied by uacs canadian division now prattwhitney canada in longueuil quebec cn and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit so they dropped the train from the name in cns marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the turbo although it retained the full turbotrain name in cns own documentation and communication with uac a goal of cns marketing campaign was to get the train into service for expo  and the turbo was rushed through its trials it was late for expo a disappointment to all involved but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing the turbos first demonstration run in december  with conductor james abbey of toronto in command included a large press contingent an hour into its debut run the turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near kingston the turbos final run was on october   dieseledit in  the cnr made its first experiment with diesel electric locomotives acquiring two from westinghouse numbered  and  it was the first north american railway to use diesels in mainline service these early units proved the feasibility of the diesel concept but were not always reliable no  served until  and no  until  the difficulties of the great depression precluded much further progress towards diesel locomotives the cnr began its conversion to diesel locomotives after world war ii and had fully dieselized by  most of the cnrs firstgeneration diesel locomotives were made by general motors diesel gmd and montreal locomotive works for its narrowgauge lines in newfoundland cn acquired from gmd the  series models nf road numbers – and nf road numbers – for use on the branch lines cn purchased the emd g road numbers – for passenger service the cnr acquired gmd fp diesels as well as clc cpa alco mlw fpa and fpa diesels these locomotives made up most of the cnrs passenger fleet although cn also owned some  railliners budd rail diesel cars some dualpurpose diesel freight locomotives freight locomotives equipped with passenger train apparatus such as steam generators as well as the locomotives for the turbo trainsets via acquired most of cns passenger fleet when it took over cn passenger service in  the cn fleet as of update consists of  locomotives most of which are products of either general motors electromotive division emd or general electricge transportation systems some locomotives more than  years old remain in service much of the current roster is made up of emd sdi and emd sdi locomotives and ge cw locomotives recently acquired are the new emd sdm and ge esdc beginning in the early summer months of  cn purchased a small order of ge cs and ge cws from union pacific and bnsf railway respectively the intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative cn currently have  ge esacs on its roster and all  were ordered and delivered from december december  they are cns first acpowered locomotives comfort cab cn locomotives have long featured unique features unlike the stock emd and ge locomotives cn introduced a widenosed four window comfort cab the predecessor to the now standard north american safety cab which is now standard on new north american freight locomotives cn train at east junction edmonton  ditch lights after a bc derailment cn introduced ditch lights lights mounted on or just below the anticlimbers on the front pilot of a locomotive these are used to make trains more visible at gradecrossings and to give better visibility around curves since then ditch lights have become standard features on all north american locomotives class and marker lights cn continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years up to as recently as the cm and sdf which feature red green and white class lights and the first order cwl locomotives which retained white class lights more recently cn has had red marker lights installed on their esdc and sdm locomotives for use when the locomotives are in dpu service windshields cns first few orders of esdcs like their cws feature teardrop windshields windshields with the outer lower corner dropped like earlier sdis as opposed to the standard rectangular ge windshield for better range of vision headlights the first order of sdm locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab while the second order  series dropped the headlight to the nose and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab control stands while many railroads have ordered new desktop controls where the controls are arranged on a desk—cn returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally this arrangement makes reverse operation easier and allows engineers to put their feet up without feeling stuck at a desk all day car body cns general motors sdf sdf retired bombardier hrs and general electric cm feature a fullwidth car body that is tapered directly behind the cab to allow for better rear visibility this is referred to as a draper taper after its creator the first order of the ge c – was also initially an order for  locomotives with the fullwidth draper taper car body they were changed to a standard long hood with a cnstyle fourwindow cab and the order was increased to  locomotives at the same price freight carsedit main article freight car hoppers in saintefoy quebec city april  rotary gondola open hopper auto carrier trilevel auto carrier auto parts

price appreciate by about  since the capital gain looks very modest investors should be cautious investor takeaway cnis strong q performance should give investors confidence about the companys second half of  its business segment operates as a duopoly in canada this makes it a low risk investment if the overall economy continues to expand although its dividend yield is not particularly attractive the company was able to deliver double digit annual dividend growth rate in the past and is expected to continue increase its dividends in the future since the month target price implies only a modest capital appreciation investors should be cautious buying the stock when it dips and avoid chasing it high thank you for taking the time to read this if you like my article please scroll to the top and

watching cn reported highestever quarterly volumes and revenue increased market share and doubledigit profit growth but a major product it ships may be at risk and higher fuel prices will increase operating expenses jason hall tmfvelvethammer may   at am when canadian national railway nysecni reported its firstquarter results on april  they were more of the same excellent results investors have gotten used to and even better than weve seen in recent years the company reported revenue of  billion canadian dollars up  and earnings per share of ca up  cn as it is commonly known saw carloadings increase  with growth coming from all but two of its customer segments and rail tonmiles increase  however higher fuel costs  up  from last year  and tariffs on a major canadian export  wood products  are set to impact the companys results for the rest of the year image source canadian national railway keep reading for a closer look at cns results as well as what management has to say about fuel wood products and the companys prospects note all financial amounts in this article are in canadian dollars as reported by canadian national railways strong growth across product segments driving solid results one of cns competitive advantages is that its one of the most diversified major railroads in the first quarter five different kinds of carloadings each accounted for more than  of its total revenue with intermodal  which is actually made up of lots of different kinds of freight  being the biggest at  better yet the company saw carloads increase in four of those five and rail tonmiles increase in every carloading category except forest products image source canadian national not only does this diversity of revenue streams help offset cyclical weakness from a single industry but it also gives cn flexibility in where it can invest for future growth cns recent investments in expanding its intermodal capacity are paying off with carloads up  and rail tonmiles up  last quarter the company also benefited from managements efforts to strategically position its operations for the recent surge in grainshipping demand following bumper crops in canadas grain belt carloads were up  and rail tonmiles increased a whopping  in this category which was  of revenue in the quarter tariffs and oil prices are set to create profit headwinds over the past couple of years shipments of canadian lumber and other forest products have been a source of solid revenue and growth for cn and with us new home construction set to continue growing in a solid economy with strong demand this is an industry cn has been counting on to be a source of stable growth in the near future image source getty images however recent trade actions by the trump administration could put the brakes on that at least for the short term in late april the us department of commerce put tariffs of between  and  on different canadian woodproducts companies a move thats almost certainly going to impact volumes that cross into the us a final ruling isnt expected until september and in the interim its likely that american lumber buyers will look for alternatives as these tariffs will essentially get passed along to the buyer at the same time oil prices are up sharply since last year which means cns cost for diesel is up as well last quarter the company spent ca million in fuel  more than the yearago quarter the higher fuel price was the primary reason that cns operating ratio  the percentage of revenue that covers operating expenses  increased  basis points to  management says that higher fuel prices will increase the operating ratio by  to  basis points for the full year even with challenges management sees a big year ahead higher fuel prices have been an eventuality for some time and to some extent cn is able to pass this along to customers and even with the potential weakness in forest products depending on how things play out with the proposed tariffs cns management expects rail tonmiles to increase  and pricing to increase higher than inflation with strong demand across multiple carload types based on these expectations management increased its guidance for earnings as well boosting adjusted earnings per share from the prior guidance of ca to a range of ca to ca  an  to  boost in guidance and a  to  increase from  while cn will still feel the impact of economic swings and industry cycles it remains one of the bestrun most efficient railroads in north america managements steady focus on allocating capital across multiple carload types and diversifying the companys operations continues to pay off for longterm investors it looks like management is set to continue delivering solid returns in the years ahead jason hall has no position
