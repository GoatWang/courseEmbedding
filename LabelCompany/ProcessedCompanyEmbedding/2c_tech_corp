electric bill this economic wakeup call inspired robert to examine more efficient methods of conserving electricity while still providing required illumination his search determined that high brightness led diodes would be appropriate if applied correctly owens formed a group of seven individuals across multiple countries to design and configure the led diodes into a fixture that looked like a light bulb and could be sold at an affordable price robert and his team had to come up with a new design for the led bulb had to figure out how to make it dim with traditional triac dimmers and had to determine color temperatures the team spent a year developing the new technology and building the foundation for most of the led lighting designs and circuity that are currently on the market they were responsible for the invention of the ledt led ushape t the first lutron compatible dimming circuit led par  par  par and  shapes with dimming capabilities in  robert sold his existing business and started his own led lighting company in order to bring his designs to market over the next few years that company grew from  customers and four led designs to  dealers in  countries with over  new led designs in an effort to keep pace with this rapidly expanding market an investment firm was brought in to assist with growth this didn’t work out and owens left to incorporate c technology inc a year later with a new vision and far superior means of execution c technology inc is built on robert’s  hours in the led industry plus a ten year relationship with his manufacturing partners in china and other countries he is regarded as a leading industry expert and is regularly sought out on a global level for his insights and vision through a mutually exclusive contract with his global partners c technology uses robert’s industrial expertise to codesign new lighting that is specifically tailored for the usa near the cost of purchasing directly from china c customers now receive some of the best led products in the world at a cost that enhances their roi calculations c’s high brightness lights cost less than competitive brands and typically run  times the efficiency

suffer from degenerative eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration which ultimately lead to blindness the number of these patients is rapidly increasing as the population ages despite recent technological advances there are only a few approved therapies available now that can help a small fraction of these patients c tech is developing a novel breakthrough nanotechnology based medical device the seeq to address this unmet market need the result of this development effort is the unique patent pending seeq device involving intraocularly delivered photoactive nanoparticles particles which convert light to electrical energy similar to a conventional solar cell but on a subcellular scale ramgopal p rao ceo ramgopal rao is a serial entrepreneur with  years of experience in the ophthalmic pharmaceutical and device industry currently he is chief executive officer of c tech corporation inc an emerging medical device company that is developing a novel nanotechnology application for preservation of vision for patients with macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy   ram is inventor founder and ceo of lensgen inc a startup medical device company that is developing a novel intraocular lens for presbyopia this technology has potential to restore youthful vision for everyone over the age of  the company has received support from one of the largest medical device companies in the world   he was chief operating officer and director of vitreoretinal technologies inc a venture funded ophthalmic pharmaceutical company that developed a drug for diabetic retinopathy   mr rao codeveloped an innovative corneal implant device for presbyopia and licensed the technology to venture funded acufocus inc the company is now in its final stage of us regulatory approval process   prior to that mr rao founded tomey technology inc that pioneered the corneal topography imaging technology that is now a standard of care in eye care mr rao was president of ophthalmic group at premier laser systems inc a publicly held company he also held various executive positions at biorad laboratories inc healthcare nanotechnology c tech corporation inc  jenner suite  irvine ca   wwwctechcorpcom   interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published � november     ceocfo mr rao what is the focus at c today mr rao we are trying to prevent a number of diseases that cause blindness these are generally what we call in our business retinal degenerative diseases that would be things like macular degeneration retinitis pigmentosa and diabetic retinopathy   ceocfo what approach are you taking how does it differ from the approaches that have been taken so far mr rao this technology that we developed at the university of colorado is quite unique and quite novel as well it basically operates on the principal that if you take any degenerating cells in the retina and stimulate them with a small amount of electricity as a natural defense mechanism they release a whole slew of neurotrophic factors and growth factors and they in turn protect the cell from degeneration that is how you arrest the progression of the disease and you may also reverse some of it but not completely this approach is pretty unique because we are using neuronal electro stimulationan nanotechnology we actually inject semiconductor nanoparticles in a suspension into the eye they migrate into the retina and they convert ordinary light coming into the eye into electricity therefore you do not need external wires or batteries or any kind of implantation within the retina none of that it is minimally noninvasive and quite effective these nanoparticles clear the eye in about three months and then you have to reinject them   ceocfo are you injecting them right into the eye mr rao yes we inject them right into the eye into the vitreous   ceocfo how do you do that painlessly  mr rao you just administer a topical anesthetic this is not a new thing many drugs that are given for retinal diseases today are also injected into the eye you use a very small thirty gauge needle and you generally do not need anything other than placing a few drops of anesthetic and an antibiotic with the injection for example there is a drug called lucentis for the wet form of macular degeneration this drug is sold by genentech roche those are monthly injections for those patients each injection costs two thousand dollars and is covered by medicare   ceocfo you say this is going to work for a variety of conditions is that because the root cause is all the same or covers the same areas mr rao the end stage in all of these diseases is that the photo receptor cells those are the rods and cones in the retina start degenerating that is what really leads to the blindness what we are doing is essentially preventing the degenerating process to continue whenever you start the treatment hopefully that is where the degenerating process will stop   ceocfo where are you in the development process mr rao we have worked for about four years in the labs in the university working with various animal models we can work with animal models which exactly mimic the disease process in humans through experimentation we try to prove the efficacy and the safety of the device in terms of anatomic safety physiological safety and also functional efficacy it is much more difficult to do functional efficacy in animals but we have tried that once we have convinced ourselves that yes the device is very safe and efficacious then the device is a safe biomedical and biocompatible device we already went through some processing steps and since this is such a new and novel technology there is not a lot of knowhow here we are creating it as we go how to convert nanomaterials that we purchase from someone else into a safe medical device and how to assure that it is biocompatible not harmful and how to process it without changing its properties those are all the processes that we have gone through over the last year to a year and a half and now we are very close to having what we call a clinical product that we can try in humans this clinical product has been tried on animals again to assure product safety once we know that it is safe in animals we will provide that data to institutions that will evaluate the data  if they consider that it is safe then they will allow for injection into humans initial patients in the study will be nearly blind patients or almost blind patients we will assure ourselves of safety first and then gradually we will inject it into people who have a slight amount of sight   ceocfo is there a lot of research being done in this area is the community aware of what c has been working on mr rao at least in ophthalmology a number of people are aware of it the problem that we are trying to solve is quite huge these are large indications in the us alone there are approximately sixteen million people who are going blind they have nothing available today no device no approved drug and device therefore these are the indications that attract investment there is a lot of activity one that comes closest to ours is a company also in this area called �second sight� they actually surgically implant a silicone chip in the retina they have to provide external power for it and it also works on the principal of electrical stimulation of the surrounding cells that company is on the verge of getting fda approval now  because of the high risk of the surgery they are only implanting it in people who are blind it would sell for about one hundred thousand dollars   ceocfo that is a vast comparison from what you are able to do mr rao that is right   ceocfo how do you increase awareness in the opthamologic community mr rao we need to have a human data this is an important milestone that is when we will receive a lot of interest from strategic partners and first tier venture capital companies that is when they consider a device as a serious device because now a lot of technology risk has been taken off of the table   ceocfo development is always expensive how far will your current funding take c tech corporation mr rao right now we are in the early stages of negotiation with a strategic company  if they do invest with us which will happen in the next couple of months if it does happen then in about a year from now we will be able to prove the efficacy and safety in small clinical trials in humans that is about a fifteen month away we have sufficient funding to go through that process with this partnership   ceocfo what is happening day to day in the company mr rao we are working on two or three different fronts about a third of the activity is in financing right now we are more focused on working with this company which is in the diligence phase that we supply whatever information they need in order to conduct their diligence working with their consultants and so on that takes about a third of the time maybe another twenty percent of the time devoted to day to day working with out patent counsels we have about two patents to be filed they are filed through the university of colorado and we license them those patents are now just starting to receive office action both in the european office as well as in us so now we are in a mode to respond to their questions and cover their objections and all of that  we are going through that process with our patent counsel rest of the time has to do with product development effort one of the issues that we had in the past in acquiring materials from the vendors some of the materials had some undesirable aspects now we are working with the vendors and trying to resolve some of those issues and improving on the process so that we will have the clinical products for clinical trials within the next four of five months we are going through all of those steps we are working with a number of vendors on that   ceocfo how do you deal personally and as a company with the frustration that it takes so long to get an idea into trials and usage when you feel that you have something that could really make such a major difference for people mr rao that is such a good question if you have been in this business for as long as i have this becomes almost a part of your dna it gets into your dna you recognize that it takes a long time there is a lot of risk that investors vc�s are unwilling to assume particularly after the  financial disaster most of the venture community has become so conservative they are reluctant to look at any company that is considered an early whatever funds they do have they are allocating to companies that they are already in and companies in clinical stage they can do this because they have the luxury right now what we are finding out  that surprised me is that there is now some funding available from various government sources such as state governments and sbirnih some of these funding sources have become a little bit more available than ever before they have also become practical for many early stage companies we did raise quite a bit of money from the state of colorado some of the universities are also funding university based research we have done that too we also raised funds from high net worth individuals who can put seed capital in some cases philanthropic organizations focused on a particular disease  they are also making small investments in novel companies we basically had to run around a lot you find out that a disproportionate amount of your time really goes on hunting and chasing the capital rather than working on the technology your question is good because as a society we should ask ourselves how we really fund innovation how do we really identify a novelty quite quickly and fund it we just do not have a good mechanism   ceocfo why should investors and people in the business community pay attention to c tech mr rao it is a very innovative idea it is proven safe and effective already in animals models the evidence is overwhelmingly strong there is good probability that the technology will be practical because there are already similar devices much more expensive and invasive already proven effective in humans the probability that this will work in humans in extremely high and the milestones that we need to achieve are not too far away therefore it is an excellent investment disclaimers any reproduction or further distribution of this article without the express written consent of
