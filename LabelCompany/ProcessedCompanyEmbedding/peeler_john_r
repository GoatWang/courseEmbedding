management may address nongaap financial measures information regarding such nongaap financial measures including reconciliation to gaap measures of performance is available on our website with that ill turn the call over to john for opening remarks john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer thanks shanye veeco delivered solid revenue growth and improved profitability in the second quarter bookings were  million up  quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear although a bit lower than expected revenue was  million the highest since  adjusted ebitda was nearly  of revenue and eps of  per share was above the midpoint of our guided range we also achieved a couple of key mocvd product release milestones in q we transitioned epik to a bifurcated revenue model and we recognized revenue on our first propel gan power electronics tool only six months after its release overall im pleased with our q performance and ill turn the call over to sam to provide further details shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance thanks john and good afternoon everyone today i will be discussing our nongaap financial performance you can find a detailed reconciliation between gaap and nongaap results in the press release and also on our website veeco is continuing to perform well against our financial target delivering results above the midpoint of our guidance range across all pl metrics for the second quarter of  revenue was  million up from  million in q as a reminder q revenue levels were highly dependent on the timing of the transition of epik product to our standard revenue upon shipment model we achieved this significant milestone in late may which was in line with our expectation as a result epik tools which shipped after the transition date were included in q revenue epik tools that shipped prior to this transition date will remain in deferred revenue until we receive final customer acceptance q gross margin was nearly  up approximately  basis points from the first quarter and above the midpoint of our guided range higher business volumes combined with a favorable product mix more than offset the impact of initial epik revenue starting to hit the pl importantly the margin on epik tools we are currently booking is higher than tools we shipped in the first half of this year we have made excellent progress on our product cost reduction plans which we are implementing through the end of this year operating expenses were  million compared to  million in the first quarter attributed to higher business volumes combined with our annual merit increases we continue to prudently manage costs while allocating rd investments towards growth opportunities that offer the highest return we increased nongaap earnings per share to  based on diluted share count of approximately  million shares adjusted ebitda was  million and represented approximately  ebitda margin on incremental revenue q over q these results illustrate the operational leverage in our model and we will continue to focus on driving sustainable profitability now turning to market data you may recall we changed our reporting method last quarter and now provide revenue and booking data by the end markets we serve we believe this change more accurately reflects our business given that we sell multiple products into each of these end markets starting with bookings we recorded  million in q an increase of about  million over q bookings orders improved both sequentially and yearoveryear but as john noted earlier they were still below our expectation driven largely by macro condition in the lighting display and power electronics business our orders were partially impacted by the volatility in the china market certain led manufacturers experienced challenges in accessing capital through the credit markets as a reminder veeco requires the meaningful cash deposit at the time of booking which helps to lower our financial risks based on discussions with these customers additional mocvd capacity still require and we expect these delayed investments to occur over the next six to nine months overall lighting display and power electronics increased to approximately  of q bookings as compared to  in q bookings for advanced packaging mems and rf remained healthy at  of total orders on an absolute basis q represented the fifth consecutive quarter of growth for this market segment enhanced by the addition of our psp business the scientific and industrial markets made up approximately  of total orders down from  in q data storage made up the balance of q bookings at  down from  in q slowing pc demand and a weak enterprise market caused hard disk drive manufacturers to reconsider their investment as a result a couple of orders we had forecast to close in the second quarter have been placed on hold for the time being overall we expect led lightning to drive orders in the nearterm and we have indication for additional investments through early  depending upon timing of these investments we would expect second half bookings to be flat to up as compared to the first half of this year now turning to revenue highlights sales to the lighting display and power electronics market made up a majority of q revenue at approximately  advanced packaging mems and rf comprised  of total q revenue and were relatively flat quarteroverquarter on an absolute dollar basis psp business makes up the underlying majority of this market segment however its important to point out that were cross selling into our other market segment and overall psp sales were up nearly  in q scientific and industrial sales were approximately  of total revenue flat on a percentage basis with q this business tends to be lumpy with a broad range of customers spanning from universities for research purposes to our recently announced ion beam deposition sale to germany based s optics data storage sales more than doubled on a sequential basis and comprised about  of second quarter revenue however as noted earlier weak market conditions are negatively impacting the hard disk drive market while capital budgets are not completely frozen hard disk drive manufacturers are scrutinizing every investment as a result we expect our data storage business to continue to face a challenging environment with sales fluctuating from quartertoquarter on a geographic basis china made up about  of total revenue in q driven primarily by demand from leading led manufacturers the remaining  of revenue was spread fairly evenly across each of the other three geographic regions the us emea and the rest of the world we ended the quarter with a healthy backlog of  million and lastly our booktorevenue ratio was just under  now moving to the balance sheet cash balance increased slightly to  million at the end of the quarter we continued to effectively manage working capital and generated approximately  million in cash from operations now turning to guidance for the third quarter we expect q revenue to be in the range of  million to  million driven largely by strong demand for epik products nongaap gross margin is expected to be in the range of  to  we are driving gross margin improvements and target achieving  or higher towards the end of this year were guiding nongaap operating expenses to be between  million and  million consistent with our prior expectations for opex to be in the low  million range gaap eps is expected to range from a loss of  to a profit of  per diluted share on a nongaap basis we expect eps to be in the range of  to  per diluted share assuming an effective tax rate of approximately  adjusted ebitda guidance is between  million and  million finally we reiterate our view for  revenue growth to be greater than  with second half revenues higher than the first half and with that ill turn the call back to john for our business update john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer thanks sam id like to start off by sharing our perspectives on the led market for some time now weve been talking about led lighting adoption as the next industry growth driver a third wave of demand which follows led backlighting for mobile devices and tvs  is expected to be a crossover year marking the first time that led unit shipments into the lighting space will surpass those shipped for backlighting applications even so were still in the early innings of led lighting adoption with penetration well below  on a unit basis led lighting adoption for industrial and commercial purposes has progressed well energy conservation and cost savings initiatives have spurred numerous cities around the world to adopt leds for street lighting and other commercial uses including new york london shanghai and tokyo however cost remains a key barrier for broader led lighting adoption and this is especially true of the consumer space which represents a large percentage of the  billion sockets worldwide when i walk the aisles of home depot i can pick up a  watt bulb for less than  and according to ledinside the global average selling price of a  watt led bulb is around  today prices have declined by more than  since  and led penetration into lighting has more than doubled over the past two years which is encouraging and indicates penetration is accelerating as unit pricing declines for veeco this trend supports the need for additional mocvd capacity over the next several years looking beyond the general lighting space an increasing number of led applications are emerging for example last quarter we highlighted led technology for indoor agriculture which is enabling yearround food production using a fraction of the water and land required by traditional farming methods this last month construction began in new jersey on what will become the largest indoor vertical farm in the world and when complete this facility will offer a highly efficient and sustainable food supply thats close to consumers leds are also playing an important role in the socalled internet of things smart lighting combines leds with builtin sensors and added intelligence for example these connected devices can detect when a room is occupied in order to optimize energy consumption or even function as a security device one of the more interesting iot applications is in the area of wireless communications led offer the capacity for using visible light for mobile connectivity with mobile data traffic projected to increase by a factor of ten over the next five years the introduction of lifi or led based mobile networks could prove lucrative in extending mobile bandwidth these are just a few of the emerging applications that make up what we are describing as the fourth wave of led demand these emerging applications drive additional mocvd demand in the future and accordingly we project mocvd dollar tam to reach nearly  billion by  veecos rapid pace of innovation and strengthening position in the mocvd market positions us well to capitalize on these growth opportunities as recent industry reports point out led manufacturers are facing acute challenges to remain relevant players in the space declining led bulb prices and steep competitive pressures have impacted profitability levels these challenges are very pronounced in taiwan one of the first regions to ramp led capacity and now one of the first confronting and ageing mocvd installed base by our estimates about a quarter of their installed capacity is made up of older generation mocvd systems which we believe are no longer cost effective to operate to address these challenges led manufacturers are focused on lowering their overall production cost and epik is the key enabler the cost to produce an led on epik is significantly lower than prior tool generations epiks innovative design serves to maximize tool availability and improve production yield epik provides a  cost of ownership advantage compared with our prior generation maxbright tool a  cost of ownership advantage compared to our ki and an even bigger advantage compared to older tools from the competition so a compelling value proposition for our customers and a competitive advantage for veeco we recently shipped our th epik mocvd reactor which was equivalent to about  ki reactors this is an impressive figure considering that we just released the product late last year and importantly this milestone illustrates the rapid pace of customer adoption and ongoing pull for epik turning to our precision surface processing or psp business were delivering solid performance in the core mems and rf markets our waferstorm product is the established leader for metal liftoff applications a key step in manufacturing mems and rf devices our differentiated process technology enables complete film removal in a single tool which shortens the cycle time and maximizes yield we continue to strengthen our position and in q we won business with a leading european electronic components manufacturer resulting in the largest single customer sale in psps history our award winning waferetch product is gaining market attention for through silicon via reveal applications an important step in advanced packaging applications veecos solution offers cost and process advantages over alternative technologies and were seeing the benefits of leveraging veecos operational infrastructure and sales organization to identify and better serve these opportunities were currently engaged with multiple leading device manufacturers across the us and asia and while its early were very pleased with our results so far overall psp is executing very well against our expectations and is contributing to veecos overall top and bottom line growth we had established a target to grow the business by  on an annual basis were ahead of that pace in  with revenue expected to top our  million target looking ahead we have the opportunity to accelerate growth depending on our success in advanced packaging  is shaping up to a good year for veeco were executing well against our strategic objective to drive profitable growth our epik mocvd tool is addressing our customers immediate challenges and in turn they recognize the value were delivering the psp business is performing ahead of our expectations capturing opportunities in core markets and gaining momentum in the new growth areas like advanced packaging we are targeting to deliver a top line growth of greater than  this year and we expect ebitda to grow faster than revenue with that well start the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you well take our first question from paul coster with jp morgan paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc yeah thanks for taking my questions perhaps looking beyond the horizon just a little bit can you give us your latest thoughts on use of the alds technology and for that matter also the use of ibd in extreme ultraviolet lithography is there any signs of progress in either of these areas should we expect revenues at some point in the next couple of years john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer sure well let me start off with the ald weve been working to develop the ald technology for some new applications for some time now we are not prepared to say a lot about that but we are addressing some semiconductor applications which we think have large potential and i think there is still an opportunity in the oled encapsulation area so thats the first thing secondly on euv that market does seem to be waking up a little bit and we do expect or at least hope to get some additional euv orders for mass blank deposition devices within i dont know six months to – six months or more and on ion beam technology were developing the technology for some important new applications there also well beyond the data storage market so a lot happening in the new technology area well have more to tell you later this fall on that paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then a quick followup you talked to the  billion mocvd addressable market is this third party research or have you have done some work internally that gives you comfort that that kind of level is attainable now as we move forward shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance hi paul this is sam this is our own modeling of course we have obtained inputs from other thirdparty estimates and then we have looked at the market the primary driver for this is the adoption for general lighting along with a replacement cycle and overall on a secular modeling perspective it comes out at about  growth rate yearonyear and reaching  billion in tam of course a few things can accelerate that if the replacement cycle happened sooner it could accelerate these numbers even more and then the more important thing is that we talked about fourth wave and if some applications get adopted faster it could accelerate these numbers even more paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you very much operator well take our next question from edwin mok with needham  company edwin mok  needham  co llc hi sorry a little technical problem there first actually just a basic housekeeping kind of question for you sam how much of your shipment that was done in the second quarter that was part of that deferred epik  revenue that you talked about shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance sure so as i said we obtained our bifurcation model status in late may so all the products that shipped before may edwin that got deferred and that we would be able to revenue as we get final product accepted we have started to provide ending deferred revenue for epik in the last quarter because it was difficult to understand the shipment level that the company was going through i would probably provide this one last time at the end of this quarter and expect you to not get this number from us in future but at the end of q we have about  million of deferred revenue still on the books and as time goes by here we would be looking forward to getting acceptances from the customers and slowly working it down now keep in mind the product that shipped after may it is already in our revenue numbers for q and we are providing a reiteration of our prior guidance of full year  growth so all those numbers are baked into fullyear guidance that we are providing edwin mok  needham  co llc great thats very helpful and then i think you made a comment about bookings being maybe a little stronger in the back half of this year versus first half is that predicated on some of these chinese customers able to get credit to execute expansion plan or what other driver could lets say accelerate or increase that shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance yeah good question edwin we are guiding bookings to be up in second half over first half the macro conditions are definitely in play here as you know more than half of our business is in china at the company level and some of these macro conditions are still playing out so there could be some volatility in the order pattern here and overall the led unit demand remains strong there have been these recent price reduction in bulbs which may further increase the unit demand and our business is really driven by the unit demand of leds at the same time we are hearing about lower utilization from some led customers and that is to do with as john talked about productive and unproductive led capacity but for us as of now there is a lot of customer interest there is a lot of quoting activity going on and although the market may be somewhat soft but it seems to us from our vantage point there is some compensation going on for our products competitive differential performance so were seeing a lot of activity here in terms of specifically how it falls out in which quarter it is not entirely – it cannot be predicated accurately at this time but overall the demand remains very strong and if the customers in china are not able to fulfill that demand our expectations would be that some other customers in some other countries may pick up that supply and fulfill that demand edwin mok  needham  co llc great very helpful if i can squeeze one in on psp it looks like that business is going quiet well do you think for the  growth that you guys are targeting for this year and beyond right do you expect most of that come from growth of advanced packaging or what are the drivers of that business that will drive upside or downside of that business john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer well most of the existing business is not advanced packaging its really products to support mobile applications mems rf filters some power electronics some leds kind of a broad spectrum of compound semiconductor type processing that business has been growing well for us and then on top of that weve got the advanced packaging business which is getting larger and were seeing a lot of pull from some key idms and really important customers in the market we can do the  growth we believe without a lot of edwin mok  needham  co llc okay thanks for clarifying that john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer okay we can do the  without a lot of advanced packaging edwin mok  needham  co llc great thanks thats all i have thank you operator well take our next question from krish sankar with bank of america merrill lynch krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks for taking my question i have two of them one is you guys spoke about the macro and the financial impact on china customers kind of curious of your  sales in q how many customers was it divvied up by and are most of these customers the wellcapitalized companies the big ones with good connections or are you seeing a huge spectrum of customers in china shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance krish this is sam our business in china is largely driven by the led segment these customers are well capitalized i do want to remind you though is that whenever we count any order as booking we require a meaningful deposit at the point of calling an order a booking so it is important for some of our customers to access those lines of credit and be able to provide that advance cash deposit for us to take the purchase order krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch got it okay all right and then a followon kind of curious if you look at how your competitors results were they didnt seem to have shipped any mocvd tool in q from your vantage point what do you think your market share today is or where do you think you will exit  in terms of your mocvd market share shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance krish our product is doing very well it is getting very good reception there is a lot of quoting and theres a lot of customer interest and we are continuously getting more requests than less in terms of accelerating the product shipment so we are really proud of our team and my colleagues here in the mocvd business unit that have released this product and we are extremely pleased with the performance of the product john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer so just to add to that weve seen a very rapid transition of many of our customers from the ki and the maxbright to the epik product probably faster than usually happens and i think thats indicative of the strength of the product how confident the customers are in using it and the ease of which theyre moving their current past recipes from our other tools on to this new tool shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance yeah yeah and i would just add to that that i think we are moving in the true north direction here we just have to wait for the third parties to come out with their numbers in terms of the specific analytical question that you asked but we are definitely moving in the right direction from our vantage point krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you guys thank you john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer thanks krish operator well take our next question from vishal shah with deutsche bank jerimiah booreamphelps  deutsche bank securities inc hi this is jerimiah booream on the line for shah thanks for taking our question i was just hoping you could expand a little bit on the orders for this quarter and i know you mentioned that a couple were pushed out do you know if those were just pushed out or if it could be permanent issues with the chinese market john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer in terms of the led space its more of a push out in terms of customers ability to access capital or access credit the plans to expand remains intact our orders were also impacted by weak – continued weak demand in pcs and enterprise servers in the data storage segment and there it is not entirely clear whether those investments by our customers is permanently on hold or its a pushout it is not entirely clear to us on the data storage side unknown speaker okay but so for the oled sorry for the epik systems that youre looking to ship thats still looking all right john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer yeah that seems more or like pushout yes unknown speaker okay and then just generally speaking on utilization rates i know you said you are seeing some lower rates is that more a function of the degrading tools or the industry and what are the implications there for orders going forward john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer so when we look at the utilization rates of what we would call the productive tools the tools that can cost effectively make an led today its still quite high its about the same in china for tier s  probably about the same in taiwan at about  and similarly in korea i think where weve seen it fall off a little bit is the tier  and tier  in china going to about  so the rates are still quite high if youre looking at the productive tools we have seen customers turning off old tools that they bought in  or  where they just cant compete at todays pricing levels and we think that will actually ultimately turn into a replacement cycle and help our business unknown speaker great thank you operator well take our next question from mike ritzenthaler with piper jaffray mike ritzenthaler  piper jaffray  co broker hey good afternoon john just a quick question maybe actually a followup on psp is it fair to say that the revenue synergies from geographically expanding that business has been in line with your expectations or has it been a pleasant surprise john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer its probably been a little maybe a pleasant surprise a little better than in line i think we brought a global sales organization that could cover certain countries where psp had no coverage additionally we have a lot of service personnel around the world so that really was the largest synergy were expecting and i think its working well mike ritzenthaler  piper jaffray  co broker all right thanks for that on the gross margin outlook sam i guess im wondering about the last quarter you guys had talked about the mix shift toward new tools and better margins with the orders that you were taking i am wondering if how that manifested itself in the gross margin outlook maybe just being  basis points above where it was guided for q is that were still seeing that shift but maybe just at a slower pace or maybe just a little bit more color around that particular piece of guidance would be helpful thanks shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance sure yeah so gross margins continue to improve it really is a matter of some of the factors that we talked about in the past one of them is cost reduction we are quite pleased with the progress weve made in the cost reduction side and then as we negotiate those lower prices with our suppliers and then that product begins to show itself on the pl so that has an impact on the gross margin side and on the booking side and we continue to see a situation where our pricing is improving and that also has a effect on the overall gross margin of course it takes about six months from the time of booking to the time of shipment and revenue that it plays out on the pl so overall whats going on here is a unique margin expansion on the back of a very strong product along with a very successful cost reduction program and then on top of it we also have operational leverage going on so its just helping gross margin from multiple perspectives mike ritzenthaler  piper jaffray  co broker all right that makes sense thank you operator well take our next question from stephen chin with ubs stephen chin  ubs securities llc hi guys thanks for taking the question just looking at the taiwan mocvd market it sounds like you think about a quarter of those mocvd is going to be upgraded can you just give some color on how big that installed base would be roughly john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer well when we looked at the overall market first of all in taiwan as you know taiwan built its led industry really ahead of most of the other regions or really all of the other regions so it tends to have a fairly good percentage of older tools when we look across the world and at older tools which are no longer cost effective its probably in the range of  to maybe  k equivalents and i am not saying these are k reactors thats just kind of the equivalent number many of these tools are not veecos because they were sold before veeco really gained a lot of its market share but its a sizable number of tools that are available for replacement and we believe that will happen stephen chin  ubs securities llc got it thank you and then just looking at the balance sheet you guys have a lot of cash in it sounds like you are pretty confident in the business moving forward i was just curious if you are considering doing a stock buyback now especially with the stock in the mid s shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance yeah stephen this is sam so we have talked about this previously also we continue to evaluate the deployment of capital for the greatest longterm benefit for our business and our shareholders first and foremost the priority for our cash is to fund our organic growth initiatives including working capital and rd and then we are also looking at both inorganic growth opportunities andor return capital to the shareholders so we continue to evaluate these alternatives and what i can say is that obviously if we had something approved by our board we would have shared that with you so at this time i would say that we continue to evaluate those alternatives and we would make decisions well let you know the decisions as theyre made stephen chin  ubs securities llc thank you operator well take our next question from patrick ho with stifel patrick j ho  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you very much john in your comments about the  billion tam by i believe you said  how much of it incrementally is from these replacements that you talked about that gets you to that tam i mean is that like   or its just a larger number than im projecting john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer we actually – when we put that tam together we were much more conservative on the replacement cycle and we thought there was about  a year going into that we think the opportunity is bigger now but we havent quantified it into that number so id say that number could go up patrick j ho  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay fair enough going back to an earlier question about the competitive landscape given some of the commentary by your main competitor and some of the qualification issues that theyre having do you believe aside from the current market pull and the adoption of epik are you seeing any incremental pull that may be going your way because of the competitors internal issues john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer well i think our customers can always reverse decisions or change decisions weve been building the product at a rapid rate there has been a lot of pull for our product and a lot of demand product works great and its proven to be easy to transition to from the current product it is very high reliability and really working well so i think it has a tremendous future here and the turbodisc technology has a lot of inherent advantages in this marketplace and i think thats proving out especially as weve scaled the reactors to larger sizes that our technology scales exceptionally well patrick j ho  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you very much shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance thanks patrick operator well take our next question from brian lee with goldman sachs brian k lee  goldman sachs  co hey guys thanks for taking the questions and i apologize if you already commented on these but i had two around the china exposure here just maybe one housekeeping one for you sam how much of the backlog is based in china i think you mentioned the close to  million of backlog as of the end of q and then as a followup to that you guys mentioned the weakness in bookings from that region but are you seeing any delays in shipment timing or any chatter around that owing to some of the weakness in the fundamentals and capital availability that you cited thanks shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance thanks brian in terms of our backlog we typically do not provide a backlog breakdown by region however if you look at our market and geography data our revenues generally range between  to  or in that range in china so it would be fair to assume that the backlog is roughly in the same range without giving you a specific number so there is significant backlog from china now also keep in mind when we book business from china we obtain a meaningful amount of cash as deposit and then most of the business is on line of credit or lc so essentially our financial risk is significantly reduced in terms of shipment these are bank guaranteed lcs so that helps our business in terms of assuring there is not a lot of risk in collecting that cash if thats what you were trying to ask brian k lee  goldman sachs  co yeah no i guess what ive seen in the past is – and i appreciate that you guys take anywhere close to  of final sales price in terms of upfront deposit so it does derisk your bookings relative to peers weve seen that in prior cycles but wondering if some of the capital availability issues are actually leading to some of your customers wanting to delay shipment timing because they dont have the additional  to  of funds that they may need to ultimately cover to get the bookings to move to them in terms of shipments shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance so no we are not seeing that on the other hand because a lot of the backlog is related to epik we are seeing requests for further accelerating that so on the shipment side we are not seeing any deceleration of shipment dates that comment applied mostly in terms of challenges in terms of accessing credit or capital applied mostly towards booking brian k lee  goldman sachs  co okay thanks for the clarification shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance thanks brian operator well take our next question from mark miller with the benchmark company mark miller  the benchmark co llc thank you for taking my question i was just wondering you talk a lot about replacements are any of the recent orders you received you feel are replacing tools or is still that fairly small john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer the recent orders have been really new fab expansions no significant amount of replacements at this point mark miller  the benchmark co llc you received a large order the end of last year and i was just wondering has that been impacted by any of the conditions that you discussed or is that staging as you expected from sanan john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer i think its going out exactly as expected and in general there has been pull to go faster more than anything else so i think its happening right on plan for us mark miller  the benchmark co llc just one final question you mentioned tier  in china and taiwan were  what about korea is that similar john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer it is there is variation and there are some unproductive tools in korea also but the tier s are relatively up there around  some a little higher some a little lower mark miller  the benchmark co llc thank you very much john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer thanks mark operator well take our next question from mark heller with clsa mark j heller  clsa americas llc thanks for taking my question just a few followups at this point sam of the  million deferred revenue how much is expected to drop in q shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance we will take some of those tools and convert them into revenue and at this point were not adding to the deferred revenue bucket because most of the tools that we ship now are getting recognized as revenue upon shipments so what i can say to you is that its going to come down over time most of these should get recognized by the time the year ends and as i said previously we gave the deferred revenue guidance because we had just released the new product and it was difficult for the street to understand the activity level going on in the company so respectfully i think i would decline to provide that guidance mark mark j heller  clsa americas llc okay and then is there any way to quantify the breadth of customers like how many customers were buying the i versus how many customers were buying maxbright and like how many customers that youre seeing today buying epik im just wondering if your customer base is maintaining itself or is it sort of shrinking as maybe some of the weaker players fall out of the market john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer well the customer base – with the customer consolidation the number of substantial orders per quarter now is two customers to four customers in a typical quarter here and whereas if we go back three years or four years it would be  customers to  customers so there are substantially fewer players down to a number of companies that are striving to be world class leaders i think that makes the business more lumpy and that will continue as we serve a smaller customer base i think regarding epik when we look at the orders its over  of our orders now i would say in mocvd so the market has moved quickly to purchases of epik more quickly than past product transitions that weve seen shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance and i would add to that that epik really enables our customers to compete effectively in this low price end device market so thats why were seeing a pretty significant pull on epik mark j heller  clsa americas llc thank you john r peeler  chairman  chief executive officer okay with that we will close off the qa session thank you for joining us look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks and months thank you shubham maheshwari  chief financial officer  executive vpfinance thanks operator that concludes todays presentation thank you for your
