harvard business school management professor arthur segel is in demand around the world as a guest lecturer when he packed his bags last month to teach a landvaluation class inindia he brought along a favorite case that has become a staple of the real estate survey course he has taught at harvard for many years to develop the case he enlisted a harvard business school graduate he met  years ago while still an executive for boston properties inc segel describes his coauthor as thoughtful intellectually curious an excellent listener and genuinely humble—an uncommon and appealing combination among harvard’s highpowered mba candidates   although the case study is familiar to legions of harvard business school alumni segel’s collaborator has other claims to fame as president  ceo of cbl  associates properties inc stephen lebovitz leads a retail reit that owns an  millionsquarefoot state portfolio of  properties including  regional malls and openair centers since succeeding the firm’s founder—his father charles lebovitz who remains active as executive chairman—as ceo three years ago lebovitz has shepherded the chattanooga tennbased firm through the aftermath of a difficult recession   on his watch the company has maintained solid leasing started to reduce leverage and selectively pursued new developments he has also built on the firm’s longtime strategy of staking out dominant positions in markets that are usually outside the nation’s biggest metropolitan areas in many cases its  regional malls and openair centers are the only game in town   lebovitz’s associates say that he combines the best qualities of an earlier era with an uptotheminute corporate and capital markets knowhow like his father they say lebovitz is a toughminded but trustworthy dealmaker who considers a handshake agreement to be as binding as a written contract “in an industry filled with a lot of personalities i don’t think there’s anybody that doesn’t like charles and stephen” said michael graziano managing director  cohead of real estate investment banking at goldman sachs group inc which has arranged financing for cbl and advises the firm on a continuing basis graziano calls stephen lebovitz “a trustworthy ethical guy … an individual that everybody likes to work with” and the younger lebovitz brings a wall street background and elite business school training to the complex new realities of public real estate companies   those bona fi des have enabled lebovitz to navigate a slow uneven economic recovery last october cbl sealed one of the year’s blockbuster joint ventures a  billion alliance with tiaacref by transferring propertyrelated debt to the institutional giant and applying cash proceeds from the transaction to reduce leverage by another  million cbl trimmed its outstanding debt by  million that accomplishment was also a milestone in an effort that has reduced the company’s debt by  billion since    the deal recapitalized four of cbl’s trophy mall

income edged up  percent overall as portfolio occupancy reached  percent a yearoveryear uptick of  basis points funds from operations rose  cents per diluted share to    reflecting the retail sector’s stillmodest recovery lebovitz is also approving a select group of development projects as consumers continue their quest for value cbl like other retail developers is finding fertile ground in outlet centers in january cbl and horizon group properties inc announced a  joint venture to develop a squarefoot outlet center the outlet shoppes atatlanta located inwoodstock a northwesternatlantasuburb the project is scheduled for a summer  opening   that project follows last summer’s opening of the squarefoot outlet shoppes atoklahoma city a joint venture of cbl and horizon the project is thesoonerstate’s first such center and—characteristically—the only property of its type within a milewide radius in the communitycenter category the squarefoot waynesville commons inwaynesvillenc is scheduled to come online this fall   even as cbl forges ahead with the first wave of postrecession development it continues to focus on existing properties lebovitz and the company’s leadership team have earned a reputation for firstrate leasing property management tenant service and marketing last year the company ranked th on the cpemhn index of bestrun real estate companies and th among property managers “they watch the details— they sweat the details” said david zoba senior vice president  head of global real estate for gap inc which leases about  square feet in cbl properties nationwide “a lot of people that have properties in secondary markets don’t run them as well” keeping assets like cbl’s profitable demands especially sharp management zoba explained because “in secondary markets you’re not going to get the highest rents in the industry”   as part of its stewardship cbl selects a handful of regional malls every year for makeovers though many of the centers are already dominant in their markets the strategy recognizes a fundamental truth of retail real estate “in order to keep customers coming back the properties have to be fresh and up to date” lebovitz said this year’s list includes regional malls intexasmississippiandnorth carolina the  millionsquarefoot cross creek mall infayettevillenc will get new entrances interior décor and graphics amenities and landscaping besides attending to curb appeal cbl constantly reviews the tenant mix “we’re very proactive in terms of moving stores around” lebovitz asserted “we’re not waiting on the lease to expire to make those kinds of changes”   financial report   recent analyst reports regarding cbl offer a spectrum of impressions in a february update green street advisors analyst cedrik lachance calls cbl “a good operator” citing a basispoint jump in occupancy last year and rent appreciation on new leases for the past two years the company has been a net asset seller and has allocated proceeds to retiring debt and cbl’s  ratio of debt to ebitda “is a little lower than the mall sector average” lachance wrote   that saidgreen streetalso offers a few cautionary notes cbl’s leverage at  percent is  percent higher than the sector for the mall sector as a whole lachance argued in  and  almost  percent of cbl’s total pro rata debt obligations— billion—will come due lachance calls cbl’s expectation that it can meet those needs through noncore asset sales cmbs bank lending and existing credit lines “a fair assumption” nevertheless he warns against expecting that both a vibrant transaction market and adequate cmbs financing will always be available at the same time   a report by keybanc capital markets’ todd thomas offers a similarly nuanced view the company’s conservative guidance and “a steady capital markets and leasing environment could lead to upside throughout the year” thomas also argued that cbl’s  billion revolving credit line is enough to meet  million in debt obligations this year even if the real estate capital markets go through a downturn the mixed picture in the retail market presents leasing challenges although leasing velocity remains steady about  percent of new leases during the fourth quarter of  derived from shortterm deals a case in point—a location deal with struggling pacific sunwear—speaks to the continuing softness in some quarters   when lebovitz stepped into the ceo role in  he immediately had to contend with the fallout of the recession net operating income slipped  percent year over year in both  and —the first such declines since the company’s ipo in  “what we tried to do was anticipate what was coming and make the difficult decisions early” lebovitz recalled “waiting and putting off tough decisions is not something that helps anyone” like most reits cbl had to reduce expenses by trimming staff curtailing its development pipeline and postponing property renovations   the company also moved swiftly to shore up its balance sheet reaching out early to its lenders and restructuring lines of credit cbl pulled off a feat that was unusual among reits during the capital markets crisis by working with its financiers and in some cases changing the mix of lenders it extended its credit facilities without having to reduce their capacity that same year cbl also extended or refinanced nine mortgages and construction loans valued at  million all told the efforts gave it  billion in financial flexibility   while some reits felt compelled to shut down their pipelines completely in  and  “we divided projects into phases” he explained “that allowed us to move forward with what we had leased” in october  cbl and its partner forum development group llc opened the promenade a power center in d’ibervillemiss that was the biggest new retail project on the gulf coast of mississippi since hurricane katrina although the center was planned for  square feet at full buildout cbl opened only the squarefoot first phase which was  percent preleased to a roster of tenants led by anchors target best buy petsmart dick’s sporting goods marshall’s and ulta   other cbl openings during the recession include the forum atgrandview a community center inmadisonmiss developed jointly with the mattiacecothe project’s squarefoot first phase opened fully leased in november  and in march  cbl and the benchmark group unveiled phase i of the pavilion atport orange a squarefoot center in thecentral floridacity ofport orange with a roster of plus tenants the center opened  percent leased   fast learner lebovitz gravitated toward a real estate career at an early age dinnertable discussions exposed him to the business and his summer jobs were often in construction or real estate after earning a degree in political science and human biology from stanford in  lebovitz spent two years as a financial analyst in the real estate department of goldman sachs  co that experience he said laid a vital foundation “goldman gave me a huge amount of financial experience and understanding— how to underwrite a piece of real estate how to package it for sale” he explained   following graduation fromharvardbusinessschoolin  lebovitz joined cbl  associates inc the forerunner of today’s firm at the time cbl was eyeing growth opportunities with walmart and home depot two regular clients in the company’s southeast properties a further priority was building ties to new englandbased retailers like bj’s wholesale club tj maxx and marshalls already planted in thebostonarea lebovitz got the assignment of opening an office there to serve as the base camp for the company’s northeast expansion the first project was a squarefoot community center inportlandmebut financing proved to be a tall order in the depths of the savingsandloan crisis it was impossible to secure construction loans from potential lenders innew england lebovitz’s search led him back tochattanooga where a longtime cbl lender agreed to finance the project   the experience was an early lesson in the value of building relationships lebovitz spent  to  rising steadily through the ranks while still running the company’s northeast activities in  he put his capital markets expertise to work when cbl made its initial public offering he was promoted to senior vice president of communitycenter development in  moved up to executive vice president for development in  and began overseeing acquisitions as well the next year the appointment as company president came in    not long afterward cbl began work on a pivotal deal the  billion purchase of  regional malls and two other centers from the richard e jacobs group completed in  the acquisition put cbl on the course to its current footprint increasing the number of regional malls from  to  and its portfolio to  properties   cbl’s next blockbuster acquisition could well be some years away as the company sticks to debt reduction selective development and improving productivity at existing centers for now this approach is producing gains but lebovitz would be the first to tell you that there are no guarantees for even the most powerful bestrun firms still moses lebovitz would surely be pleased to know that a third generation of able executives is dedicated to keeping the family business in such good repair   arthur segel cbl  associates properties inc
