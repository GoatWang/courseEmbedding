protect your assets how to protect your assets menu  things to know before setting up an irrevocable trust thinking about setting up an irrevocable trust when it comes to setting up a trust many don’t realize the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust before you sign on the dotted line there are a few things you should know about irrevocable trusts you give up your rights with irrevocable truststo distinguish the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust the name says it all once you set up a revocable trust it’s not set in stone trustees can make changes to the trust during their lifetime at their discretion if you change your mind about leaving your home and a million dollars to your ungrateful son you can remove his name as beneficiarywith an irrevocable trust once the grantor does the initial setup the trustee takes over that means you can’t go back and rewrite or remove the terms of the trust even if there is an exception the trustee and all parties involved would have to agree to the changes even the beneficiaries would need to agree that’s a hard pill to swallow about assets you once ownedirrevocable trusts are beneficial tools for estate planningyou might be wondering why you’d want to get involved in a trust that’s so final irrevocable trusts have some nice tax benefits for estate purposes you’re able to place some property within the trust to reduce the taxable value some assets are also sheltered from estate taxes at the time of the grantor’s death and distribution there are some other pros to no longer having ownership of assets in an irrevocable trust in the event of issues with creditors it protects your estate since the assets belong to the trustee after setup creditors can’t seize assets to reconcile outstanding debts even in the case of a bankruptcy the assets will stay put in the irrevocable trustirrevocable trusts require maintenanceit may not be as simple as you think to setup an irrevocable trust the process is more than just a onetime setup irrevocable trusts require upfront and continuous fees for maintenance and to pay staff the least expensive trust will cost a few thousand dollars
