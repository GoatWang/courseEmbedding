few crucial weeksfeb  about oncolytics biotech oncyf michelle gilson oncolytics biotech inc oncy product reolysin and  patents worldwide including methods for oncolytic viral administration stock price  net loss for  expected to be  million oncolytics biotech inc is a development stage company that is in the process of developing reolysin a virus formulation that can be used in the treatment of cancer it is undergoing  clinical trials including a phase iii clinical trial this is a highrisk stock essentially worth nothing if the product does not achieve fda approval the company has  m shares equity has been its main route of financing this stock is marketindifferent with a high risk but a great reward potential the potential for this stock could be upwards of share if it is approved for one strain of cancer it will be prescribed offlabel for other types of cancers as well although this market is competitive reolysin works in conjunction with a common therapy chemotherapy oncolytics is currently undergoing a phase ii clinical trial with pancreatic cancer and a phase iii clinical trial involving metastatic cancer since there are no effective treatments for either of these diseases success in either of these trials could fasttrack reolysin for fda approval or approval in other countries europe is usually quicker to approve new products to market oncolytics would also have no competition in these markets as there are no other effective treatments if it is approved to go to market in the next year oncolytics has already partnered with sigmaaldrich co to manufacture the product and seems to be ready for commercialization in the following report i discuss the stock potential the product reolysin the key clinical trials other viruses being developed and their impact on oncolytics failed viruses and a conclusion including some key points about the company and why it is worth buying stock potential for reolysin being approved for metastatic cancer alone the potential is enormous the following assumptions have been made  mm new metastatic disease patients diagnosed in the developed world each year  of those patients go on reolysin  mm patients year price for treatment  gross margin this is relatively cheap to manufacture  sga expense mm shares by the time the company reaches profitability based on these assumptions pretax income would be over bn and net income over  bn with  mm shares the eps would be share and assuming a  pe multiple discounted back  years required to build the business up after favorable phase iii results at a  higher risk equity return requirement this could have the potential to be a share current value stock however i expect that upon favorable phase iii results there will more likely be a share buyout by big pharma the product reolysin a reovirus the reovirus is a baltimore class iii virus this means it is a doublestranded nyseds rna virus doublestranded rna viruses do not enter the nucleus and do all of their replicating in the cytoplasm the reolysin strand isolated by oncolytics biotech inc has not been engineered or modified at all it is in its original wildtype form and can be found in nature reoviruses are found in nature and it is estimated that  of our population has contracted it by the age of  and approximately  of the worlds population has been infected with and therefore built up antibodies for the reovirus it also exhibits no symptoms and is not known to cause disease especially since humans have become so resistant to its effects it is also widespread in nature and extremely common to be found in water sources and the bowels of humans the reovirus is built with its own ds rna which is contained in a capsid along with some enzymes that are necessary to its reproduction the virus binds to cell receptor proteins and enters the body where it is transported to the lysosome instead of the lysosome destroying the virus it dissolves the outer shell and frees the inner protein shell and its genetic materials into the cytoplasm this dissolving of the outer shell signals for the virus to start replicating in the cytoplasm it synthesizes its own mrna from one of its strands and its own enzymes when enough protein is made the genetic material and protein is encapsulated and the cell undergoes lysis the cell being destroyed releases the virus back into the body which is how it spreads throughout the body the ras gene is controller gene that turns the ras pathways on or off this pathways are a series of reactions in the cell that result in the cell receiving a signal to grow and divide it contains a series of reactions one of the reactions turns off the cell defense for reovirus so the cell does not recognize the reovirus for destruction when it enters the cell in cancer often the ras gene has a mutation and it creates uncontrolled cell division permanently turns on the pathway the cells do not have enough time to copy all of the cell materials and this insufficient growth leads to abnormal cells cancer cells this is one of the most common causes of cancer the reovirus naturally is tumor selective as it destroys only cancer cells with activated ras pathways while the immune systems response would normally destroy the reovirus it is deactivated when the ras pathway is activated in cancer cells the reovirus therefore replicates in and destroys cancer cell while in normal cells the bodys natural immune response kills the virus quickly leaving no effect on those cells this is what makes this virus so valuable in cancer treatment it kills cancer cells naturally and has little or no effect on healthy cells this virus is already existent in nature with mild symptoms at most whether or not it is used to treat cancer it will keep replicating and mutating it will continue to infect people as it has for centuries and people will continue to build up antibodies against different strains so its use as a cancer treatment does not expose it to any additional risk to the possibility of mutation than it has in nature it cannot change the dna of humans because it does not enter the nucleus or use human genetic material to replicate it has also performed well in regards to safety in all clinical trials there have been no adverse events during any of the trials clark madigan martinko and stahl biology of microorganisms th ed san francisco pearson education  print key clinical trials oncolytics is currently undergoing  active clinical trials the two key ones that i believe will mean the most are the phase iii head and neckmetastatic cancer trial and the phase ii pancreatic cancer trial the phase iii trial is important because it is the last stage of fda testing however the metastatic and pancreatic cancer trials are important because there are currently no effective treatments for either of these cancers if either of these passes their trials reolysin could be fasttracked toward approval another fact to note is that on the rare occasion that these clinical trials yielded full recoveries the patients who stopped taking reolysin had their cancer come back this is an important fact to note because it signifies that people who take this virus would have to take it for their entire lives head and neck cancer type platinumrefractory recurrent andor metastatic squamous cell cancers treatment paclitaxel  mgm and carboplatin auc  every three weeks in combination with the reovirus phase ii results  patients evaluable for response four had prs for an objective response rate of  six patients had sd or better for  weeks or longer for a disease control rate sd or better of  compared to  historical rates in chemotherapy alone phase iii trial the phase iii trial is randomizied twoarm meaning there is a test and a control group double blind multicenter different places trained to administer virus and perform study two stage adaptive trial this trial was designed with an initial phase and an adaptive second phase the initial stage had  patients enrolled and had a requirement to pass an independent safety evaluation after  weeks as well as an independent statistical analysis of the probability of success after  weeks the second stage was designed to have a larger number of patients enrolled this first stage was analyzed while still blinded and unexpected results were discovered however so the secondstage did not continue as planned a protocol amendment was submitted to the fda to change the trial after it was noted while the trial was still blinded that the patients with metastatic disease had a statistically significant greater progression free survival rates than the patients with local regional head and neck cancers this signified two separate test groups to be analyzed and the trial was redesigned the new study splits the patients into two categories local recurrent disease and metastasis also it increases the number of enrolled patients to  in order to achieve statistical significance when separating the groups while still blinded these groups will be analyzed both together and separately to determine if further clinical trials will be necessary to determine effectiveness of reolysin for either groups this replaced the second stage of trials though a further support trial may be required to strengthen statistical significance in december an unblinding occurred pertaining only to the secondary endpoint of determining if reolysin adds tumorspecific differential activity between metastatic and locoregional cancers the partial unblinding did not measure the primary endpoints of progressionfree survival pfs or overall survival os all parties remain blinded to this data so as to not invalidate any of the results of these two primary goals when the study is complete it measured pretreatment and posttreatment percentage changes from the patients in the study after  weeks of treatment the data from the unblinding was supportive of the decision to separate the groups in order to highlight the metastatic results of all the people in the metastatic test group with reo  experienced stabilization no growth at all or tumor shrinkage while  of those in the loco regional test group experienced this result the recist criteria for tumor stabilization remains blinded and will be measured at the end of the study for both of these groups however these initial measurements demonstrate promise in the new study particularly with metastatic cancer which will likely be the focus the company takes in its route to approval also this unblinding revealed positive results in the effectiveness of reolysin as a cancer treatment relative to the control groups it was observed in the test group that  of the  patients had exhibited tumor stabilization  growth or shrinkage while only  of the control group chemo only experienced it at a pvalue of  this is a statistically significant result this shows promising evidence for the success of the phase iii trial that is currently in progress however the criteria for recist was not unblinded so it can not be known if this data will translate to positive pfs and os rates primary study goals for reolysin at the end of the study figure  results of a rd party study on reolysin on different strains of head and neck cancers in the lab it was done on the cells in lab it is not a clinical study this new phase iii trial looks promising for oncolytics changing the trial was a good move for getting fda approval due to the potential it has for metastatic cancer more than  million people die of metastatic cancer every year this is a large amount of people who would need this treatment because there is no cure for metastatic cancer nor very effective treatment options this would make reolysin one of the only effective treatments for this type of cancer however promising the virus looks in the lab though problems may arise in clinical trials with the actual effectiveness of the virus because our immune systems response to this virus is already so strong it is possible that the immune system will seek out and destroy this virus before it can infect the cancer cells this problem however has been addressed by the use of chemotherapy as a way to suppress the bodys immune system which had not been done in previous oncolytic virus trials done by other companies reolysin has also been effective in the earlier clinical trials and the unblinding of the secondary goal data in the doubleblinded phase iii trial is encouraging as well while this virus seems to be on track to getting fda approval it must perform in this phase iii trial however there could be problems arising with reolysins effectiveness on head and neck cancer due to the variability of these particular types of cancers figure  above is the results of a study done testing the effectiveness of reolysin on different types of head and neck cancers in lab not on humans as the graph shows different types of head and neck cancers respond differently to the virus this could be an issue with the performance during the clinical trial on head and neck cancer depending on the composition of the cancers in the test  control groups reolysin may perform more poorly than it has in other trials there could also be problems arising with the metastatic cancer test group in this trial metastatic cancer is also extremely variable the mechanisms and properties of metastatic cancer cells are generally the same as the cancer cells from the place in which it originates for example if cancer in the lungs spreads to the pancreas the cancer cells in the pancreas would have characteristics of lung cancer even though it is in the pancreas the problem with a trial that is for metastatic cancer is that it is a combination of different kinds of cancers these different types may have different compositions of the types of cancer cells because this virus works through mutated ras pathways it would depend on the compositions of cells with this mutation in the metastatic cancer so the results could be much better than expected in this trial if most of the cancers being tested are caused by mutated ras pathways or they could be much worse due to the composition of the test group having cancer with a low percentage of ras mutations there have also been issues in clinical trials with the control group performing better than expected this can be an issue when the drugs virus in this case need to have a better response in the test group than the control group i do not view this as a problem however because i believe that the test group will perform at a much higher rate than the control group in latestage cancer the placebo effect should not be as effective due to the diseases advanced  widespread progression in addition the chemo in the control groups should be fairly predictable given a deep pool of data they have been in use long enough to be in generic forms if this phase iii trial is unsuccessful the company would need to undergo another the expenses relating to continuing these trials for another  months would be clinical trial expenses  manufacturing and related process development expenses  other rd expenses  operating expenses  for  months in  the available cash was  at september   which indicates that additional financing would be necessary if this phase iii trial was to fail if it were to succeed oncolytics biotech inc would have the ability to access funds needed to take reolysin to market i still suspect that they will have another public offering to raise such funds some other cancerselective viruses in process oncovex is a modified herpes cold sore virus it was being developed by genvex which was recently acquired by amgen after it entered into a phase iii trial amgen then shut down this trial and has made changes to improve it this new phase iii trial is currently going on oncovex is a manipulated virus this lowers its side effects and causes it to only target cancer cells it exhibits granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor gmcsf which encourages the immune system response to attack cancer cells this drug combines the viruss effects on the cancer cells with the immune system boost of gmcsf because gmcsf can be isolated and used on its own the phase iii trial has a control group receiving gmcsf and the test group receiving oncovex gmcsf this virus has not focused on metastatic cancer but has shown promise in locoregional cancers jx is a vaccinia virus it is a modified smallpox vaccine this virus is considered safe because genetic material for mutation is removed making it impossible to change once in human bodies this virus is in phase ii trials phase i saw  high dose patients have stabilization or shrinkage of tumors in primary liver cancer with the one phase ii trial completed the  patients small clinical trial saw positive results the mechanism that jx uses to kill cancer attacks cells with modified ras and egfr pathways which are two common causes of cancer it relies on these pathways to replicate which is what kills the cancer cells however it can only kill cells if these pathways are replicated this virus works independent of chemotherapy and can be injected intravenously as it is stable in the blood the symptoms patients experience with this virus are mild and flulike the large amount of oncolytic viruses being developed shows that the researchers in this field are still hopeful that the fda will start accepting viral therapy as a valid and safe way to battle cancer the fda has also been working with oncolytics biotech inc to design the trials in combination with the recent legislature that has been passed i believe the fda will be receptive to approving this form of treatment as long as the safety ratings stay high the involvement of big pharmaceutical companies like amgen show that there will be a lot of money put into getting at least one of them approved once one is approved it will open up many doors since there will be a precedent i believe that oncovex will be the first virus to pass phase iii testing which would help oncolytics biotech inc in two ways it will set a precedent for oncolytic viruses which i believe reolysin will exceed and bringing this virus to market will be using many of oncolytics patented methods this will bring in royalties to the company despite oncovex being the first virus to pass phase iii trials it could still have additional requirements to fulfill before being brought to market due to the fda being uneasy about manipulated viruses since they are a new technology this would not be a bad thing because it would leave the market for this type of treatment open however the metastatic cancer trials give reolysin a monopoly in that area since oncovex cannot spread through the blood failed viruses in the cancer field onyx was a modified adenovirus meaning it has doublestranded dna it must be integrated into cells nucleus in order to be transcribed into rna and sent out into cytoplasm to be translated into a protein onyx is a modified virus which means it has a gene deletion from the naturally occurring virus these modifications make the fda uneasy since the effects of mutations and further mutations of viruses and dna are unknown onyx failed for a number of reasons one of them was that there were problems with research it was found to be successful when directly injected into the tumor it only had local efficacy and did not seek out cancer cell it did not work on metastatic cancer then it was found to have some validity issues behind the basis of their patent and research they had thought that the virus worked through the p absence in some cancer cells however it was found that concentrations of the virus in infected cells was irrelevant to the amounts of p in those cells this virus also was slow to replicate it was slower than the wildtype and could not keep up with cancer cell reproduction on top of these issues onyx experienced disappointing clinical results also although there was promise with a combination of the virus with chemotherapy this route was not explored further on top of the problem this virus had with its research there were problems with the circumstances that onyx found itself in as well an adenovirus gene therapy experiment was in the news at the time a teenager died in a clinical trial from an adenovirus which put a negative light on that specific type of virus also their partner pulled funding before trial with chemotherapy could be seen through when they were bought out reolysin is different from onyx in many ways the first is in the way that reoviruses infect a cell reoviruses have ds rna this means that they do not need to enter the nucleus of the cell and are translated in the cytoplasm this means they cannot integrate into the human genome it is also a wild type virus that most of the human population has already been infected with and has developed an adapted immune response to reolysin is currently in trials with chemotherapy and have shown promising research in the delivery of the virus into the cell with chemotherapy and survival rates in the phase ii clinical trials it shows great promise in the research with metastatic cancers in phase iii trials because of its ability to travel in red blood cells which do not have any genetic material at all no chance for blood infection and it shows to have had improved pfs rates in phase ii trials one concern to note is that the control group in doubleblind trials sometimes will have greater survival rates and pfs rates than has been historically shown due to a placebo effect however in the case of latestage cancer and chemotherapy treatment the historical data has a long and stable track record since it is an older treatment tnferade is a gene therapy virus which is different than oncolytic viruses it failed due to a combination of less than impressive results and a very risky premise from which it was based it infected the genome of the cancer cells directly to cause apoptosis if mutated this could be very risky and cause mutations in the human genome this could not happen for a reovirus since it stays in the cytoplasm and has no interaction with the human genome the oncolytic viruses work parallel to the mechanisms destroying the cell it causes the mechanisms that destroy the cell but it is not the direct cause as is the case in a direct change in the human genome these two viruses are not really on the same level when it comes to safety and potential for manipulation conclusion the good reolysin is a wildtype virus has not been manipulated in lab making the fda more comfortable about its use as a treatment this is especially important given that it is a new type of treatment the control group is well known in the trials carboplatin and paclitaxil have long track records and the late stage nature of the patient population should make the patients less susceptible to the placebo effect which has been a problem in many drug trials the metastatic cancer market is very large  million or more per year and has no effective treatments meaning there would be no competitive treatments this also makes the treatment more likely to be approved by the fda considering there is nothing else that can help metastatic disease patients the potential reolysin has for annuitylike revenue streams has a huge impact on its future revenues upon approval given the fact that this appears to be a lifelong treatment if treatment stops the cancer seems to return it would be an extremely valuable buyout for big pharma lifetime prescriptions are the most favorable products to those companies the potential of reolysin for presurgery treatment can also expand its market if it is approved for neoadjuvant use metastatic cancer treatment and locoregional cancer then its market is very large the large intellectual property portfolio for viral therapy methods is a huge bonus for oncolytics biotech inc since they own many patents in this field and many other companies trying to break into the field this has the potential to be a very fruitful area because reolysin seems to be inexpensive to manufacture and has the ability to be manufactured in bulk it can have large gross margins oncolytics biotech inc has also already outsourced the commercial production to sigmaaldrich reolysin has a very good safety profile it is not toxic on its own although chemotherapy is and welltolerated by the body it has no adverse events in trials the ability for oncolytics to conduct more clinical trials even if this first one is not passed is a huge advantage because of reolysins diverse uses for treatments if head and neck cancer fails then there are still other types of cancers that could be set up with a phase iii trial such as pancreatic cancer the bad the fda is slow and careful with unknown fields such as this viral therapy it has a huge disadvantage considering that it is in completely unknown territory with no precedents set the trial sizes have been small and difficult to fill up for oncolytics biotech inc the company is not wellknown and has not gotten very much press to help get its name out this current phase iii trial is the first doubleblinded twoarm study as with all first tries it is the most likely to fail also many of the patients in the trial are in europe which might make the prescreening andor results more questionable phase iii trials have also have  failure rates the intellectual property rights are unclear right now given that this is such a new field only time can really tell if the patents hold up with the performance of this product in previous clinical trials and the potential it has to treat most types of cancer oncolytics biotech inc is a good buy in my opinion it has about a  chance to either pass the phase iii testing or be fasttracked to approval after the phase ii pancreatic cancer trial this is due to its strong preliminary performance in the one doubleblinded twoarm test and its potential to reach patients with fatal conditions and no other effective treatments this company has had a lot of support from large cancer institutions and the biology of this drug is sound it avoids a lot of the problems that other failed companies have had it has the support of the fda which worked with the company to design and refine the current phase iii trial it is less risky due to its strong safety profile and the natural state it is being administered in it also has enormous potential if approved and because of this the reward far outweighs the risk disclosure i and my family members are long oncy i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not

product reolysin harnesses the oncolytic capabilities of naturally occurring reovirus respiratory enteric orphan virus which has been shown to replicate specifically in cells with an activated ras pathway ras pathway mutations are found in approximately two thirds of all tumours including most metastatic disease which makes reolysin a potential therapeutic for cancer contents  history  products  research and development collaborations  reolysin clinical progress  references  external links historyedit oncolytics biotech inc was founded in calgary in  in response to discoveries made on the oncolytic potential of reovirus made at the university of calgary during the s from  to  the company transitioned from private to public ownership in june  it began trading on the toronto stock exchange tse and began trading on the nasdaq in  since its inception oncolytics biotech inc has worked to take reolysin its proprietary formulation of human reovirus through the development and regulatory requirements necessary to develop it as a potential cancer therapeutic in  oncolytics biotech inc received permission to conduct its first phase i clinical trial which was designed to test the safety of reolysin in human patients the positive results of this first study led to the rapid and continuous expansion of oncolytics’ clinical trial program with phase ii studies beginning in canada in  us and subsequent crossborder studies beginning in  and enrollment in a multisite phase iii trial beginning in  the company was issued its first canadian patent in august  and currently holds more than  patents worldwide including  us and  canadian patents productsedit reolysin was developed from preclinical research done at the university of calgary matt coffey and jim strong led this research and as oncolytics’ chief operating officer coffey continues to play a pivotal role in the product’s developmentcitation needed reolysin is a proprietary formulation of human reovirus which is naturally found in mammalian respiratory and bowel systems most people have been exposed to reovirus by adulthood but the infection does not typically produce symptoms reovirus was noted to be a potential cancer therapeutic when early studies suggested it reproduces well in certain cancer cell lines it has since been shown to replicate specifically in cells that have an activated ras pathway with very little effect in cells that do not have active ras pathways activating mutations of the ras protein and upstream elements of the ras protein may play a role in more than two thirds of all human cancers including most metastatic disease which suggests that reolysin may be an effective therapeutic for many rasactivated tumor types and potentially for some cell proliferative disorders research and development collaborationsedit oncolytics biotech inc has collaborative agreements with the national cancer institute the university of leeds and the cancer therapy  research centre at the university of texas health science center in san antonio to conduct multiple phase iii and phase ii trials in the united states and united kingdom there are multiple active trials in the
