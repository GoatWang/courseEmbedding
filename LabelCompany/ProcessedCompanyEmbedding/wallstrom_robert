today’s call with me today are kevin sierks our chief financial officer and sue fuller our chief merchandising officer excluding the charges outlined in this morning’s release we achieved first quarter diluted eps at the low end of our guidance reduced promotional activity led to better than planned gross margin rate performance while revenues fell below our expectations we continue to make progress on our key initiatives it is frustrating to us and i’m sure you that the progress we have made is not reflected in our current financial results it is evident that our overall business trends remain difficult we are not attracting enough new customers to the brand and traffic and sales are still very challenging our market initiatives will continue to accelerate throughout the year with our first significant investment in conjunction with mother’s day at the end of first quarter let me take just a minute to let you know what customers are telling us we have conducted several surveys and focus groups with both lapsed customers and those that have never shopped with us the results were not surprising many of these consumers associate vera bradley only with quilted cotton bags and overall interest in traditional quilted cotton products is not as strong as it used to be she wants us to scale back on but not eliminate our cotton offerings she wants solids and new fabrications she wants trendy and stylish and she wants us to distribute our products in more locations where she frequently shops for bags like department stores once they are shown our assortments these consumers overwhelmingly have a favorable reaction to the new fabrications and products we are offering they are just not aware of our new offerings which reinforces that we need to generate more exposure and brand awareness in addition our department store and potential department store partners are enthusiastic about the way our product assortment is evolving and even though reorders are running behind in our specialty retail channel our specialty retail partners agree we are heading in the right direction our specialty store partners are still asking us to reduce promotional activity and we began to make headway by eliminating our hyperpromotional or  to  off activity and paring back our promotional days by about  during the first quarter these findings have reinforced our commitment to our longterm strategic plan the elements of the plan are specifically designed to drive traffic and bring new customers to vera bradley we will continue to innovate and modernize our products increase exposure to our brand and offerings by prudently growing our distribution points including department stores and drive brand and product awareness through our elevated marketing efforts sue and i will update you on our progress against the elements of our strategic plan later in the call although we are executing a lot of strategies this year we are revising our forecast down to reflect our current business trends until we gain traction in the business growing vera bradley to a  billion company generating a high teens operating margin remains our ultimate goal however until we begin to see recovery in the business we cannot accurately predict the timing of achieving these longterm financial targets and won’t be making any additional comments on them in the meantime lastly allow me to give you a brief update on our executive team we have a very talented and experienced team that i believe is up to the challenge of turning the business around we are really excited that theresa palermo will join us as chief marketing officer on june  theresa has a strong creative and analytical background and comes to us from fossil group where she served as vp of global marketing and public relations theresa has held other key marketing roles with such companies as stride rite timberland and j jill as you know karen peters our evp of sales left the company in april we have developed tremendous bench strength in the organization over the last year including debbie kozlowski who oversees our department store relationships as vp of global and key account melissa latham who is the vp of retail stores and harry cunningham head of store development debbie melissa and harry each have many years of industry experience resources and contacts evp roddy mann who has been with the company for over seven years and was previously responsible for the sales organization is overseeing it once again since we have so much talent on the sales team our current plan is not to replace karen i will now ask kevin to give us a brief update on our first quarter results and outlook for fiscal  kevin kevin sierks thanks rob and good morning before i begin let me remind you that as a result of moving to a wholesale business model in japan we exited our direct business during the third quarter of fiscal  and have accounted for it as a discontinued operation the prior year income statement numbers i will reference reflect continuing operations in addition the current year numbers i will discuss will exclude the charges outlined in the morning’s release related to our manufacturing facility closing severance and other restructuring charges and an income tax adjustment let me go over a few highlights for the quarter net revenues totaled  million for the current year first quarter compared to  million last year and our guidance of  million to  million net income from continuing operations before charges totaled  million or  per diluted share for the current year first quarter compared to  million or  per diluted share last year as rob stated the flat eps was at the low end of our guidance in our direct segment total revenues of  million declined by  from last year this revenue number reflects a  comp sales decline partially offset by new store growth indirect segment revenues fell  to  million primarily due to lower reorders from our specialty retail accounts and the timing of our summer product launch which shifted approximately  million of revenues into the second quarter gross profit for the quarter totaled  million or  of net revenues compared to  million or  of net revenues in the prior year first quarter the yearoveryear rate improvement primarily related to an increased penetration of higher margin mfo product in our factory outlet stores leverage of overhead costs due to fall  cost reductions at our domestic manufacturing facility lower levels of liquidation sales and reduced promotional activity the rate exceeded guidance of  to  primarily due to lower promotional activity than originally planned sga expense totaled  million or  of net revenues in the current year first quarter compared to  million or  of net revenues in the prior year first quarter as expected sga dollars increased over the prior year primarily due to strategic investments including incremental marketing new store expenses and ecommerce investments the sga expense rate was at the high end of our guidance at  to  due to the lower than expected sales operating income excluding the charges outlined in the release totaled  million or  of net revenues in the current year first quarter compared to  million or  of net revenues in the prior year first quarter by segment direct operating income was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales last year and indirect operating income was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in the prior year at quarter end cash totaled  million compared to  million at the end of last year’s first quarter quarter end inventory was  million at the low end of our guidance of  million to  million and compared to  million at the end of last year’s first quarter now let’s talk about our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal  as rob noted we have lowered our expectations for the year based on our first quarter performance guidance for the year excludes the first quarter charges outlined in the release for the second quarter we expect net revenues of  million to  million compared to prior year second quarter revenues of  million the second quarter revenue expectations reflect the timing of approximately  million in indirect revenues related to the early order period or eop for our specialty retailers that shifted from the first quarter last year to the second quarter this year we expect direct segment net revenues to increase in the midsingle digit percentage range with a comparable sales including ecommerce decrease in the mid to high teen percentage range we believe our indirect net revenues will decline in the high single digits to low teen percentage range during the quarter the gross margin rate for the second quarter is expected to range from  to  compared to  in the prior year second quarter sga as a percentage of sales is expected to range from  to  for the second quarter compared to  in the prior year second quarter the expected deleverage is primarily due to incremental investment in key areas like marketing and ecommerce we expect second quarter diluted eps to be in the range of  to  diluted eps totaled  in the prior year second quarter we expect inventory to be  million to  million at the end of the second quarter compared to  million at the end of last year’s second quarter this projected inventory level reflects a better balance of current to retired inventory than a year ago and investments in key growth classifications including new fabrications for the full year we expect net revenues of  million to  million compared to  million last year our revenue guidance includes direct segment net revenue growth to range from flat to low single digit percentage increase with a decline in comparable sales including ecommerce in the low to mid teen percentage range this guidance reflects a continued reduction in hyperpromotional activity indirect net revenues are expected to decline in the low to mid teen percentage range the gross margin rate for fiscal  excluding the charges outlined related to the first quarter is expected to range from  to  compared to  last year this planned improvement reflects the leveraging of overhead costs due to a planned increase in units manufactured although the leverage will not be as significant as originally expected due to a more conservative approach to inventory growth for the balance of the year in addition the planned gross margin improvement reflects reductions in sourcing and product costs primarily related to our madeforoutlet product and including the closure of our domestic manufacturing facility a greater sales penetration of higher margin mfo product and reduced promotional activity sga as a percentage of sales excluding the charges outlined in the first quarter is expected to range from  to  for fiscal  compared to  last year the expected rate increase is primarily a result of the previously discussed strategic investments in the business in fiscal  including incremental marketing expense of approximately  million as well as incremental ecommerce and incentive compensation expense the deleverage reflects a soft sales projection we do have an active expense control program in place and we are focused on reducing expenses we have implemented or are implementing several cost reductions including recent closing of our domestic manufacturing facility negotiating lower prices with our fabric mills rightsizing the support staff for our indirect channel and gaining staff and efficiencies in our stores our expectations for diluted eps excluding the charges outlined for the first quarter range from  to  for fiscal  on a comparable basis diluted eps totaled  last year we expect our net capital expenditures will total approximately  million for the full year primarily related to new stores openings continued investment in our systems and the recent completion of our corporate campus consolidation we intend to make some targeted inventory investments primarily in the back half of the year so our inventory is projected to grow at a faster rate than sales this year let me turn the call over to sue who will give us an update on product sue sue fuller thanks kevin in the product area indiscernible our fiscal  initiative into three key categories delivering innovation newness and diversification strategically segmenting our products by channel and enhancing our gross margin we continue our focus on increasing the relevance of our products through innovation and newness our core customer is responding to the newness and we know this product evolution is critical to attract customers that have lapsed or never have shopped with us we are continuing to improve our internal innovation pipeline to keep fresh fabrication and style ideas coming our cotton performance is declining faster than our overall business trend at this point the introduction of newness and innovation is not enough to offset declines of our core quilted cotton business having said that both our retail partners and consumers are telling us that our assortments have never looked better and been more trend right and our offerings are continuing to improve each season i am really excited about our summer fall and winter collections we are moving faster and adding more inventory in certain new product fabrications and categories by diversifying into a variety of new fabrications we believe we are now more effectively able to compete and better positioned to take market share in the long run by offering primarily quilted cotton products we were only able to compete in approximately  of the bag market our expanded offerings allow us to compete in approximately  of the market as rob mentioned our core customer wants us to scale back on but not eliminate our quilted cotton offering two years ago we had two fabrications in our full line business solid microfiber which made up less than  of our fabricbased assortment and quilted cotton which comprised the rest currently we offer five fabrications quilted cotton solid microfiber leather faux leather and lighten up at the end of the first quarter approximately  of the applicable skus in our fullline business was now quilted cotton which includes our small prints and approximately  is in the four new fabrications at the end of fiscal year we expect our dependency on quilted cotton to be further reduced as we expand our noncotton products and introduce two additional fabrications our streeterville poly tulle collection ph and our preppy poly collection at yearend we will have a total of seven fabrications and expect nearly  of our applicable skus to be in nonquilted cotton fabrications this fall we are adding navy and espresso to our core microfiber assortment and adding additional skus in our core color of black microfiber continues to be our biggest nearterm sales growth opportunity as we elevate and innovate leather is becoming more important for us we will introduce our beautiful new wildwood leather collection in july the wildwood price points will be positioned between our original sycamore leather collection introduced last fall and our northbrook faux leather collection both leather collections are high quality leather are trendright are competitively priced have incredible functionality and of course have the signature vera bradley pattern on the inside sycamore is priced approximately  below our peers and wildwood will be very attractively priced below sycamore for example our nora tote in the sycamore collection is priced at  the comparable ella tote in wildwood is  both are amazing values we are especially excited about back to school which will focus on backpacks and everything that goes into the backpack including lunch boxes and stationary items last year we made a significant investment in back to school by increasing our backpack assortment adding new styles increasing functionality and introducing our lighten up fabrication sellthroughs exceeded our expectations and in units sold we moved from the number three women’s backpack brand in the us to number two last year this year we are investing even more adding new fabrications and three new backpack styles bringing the total number of styles to nine in addition we are expanding our assortment of coordinating back to school items we are getting more strategic about product segmentation sycamore and wildwood leather will be primarily distributed in our fullline stores on verabradleycom and in department stores beginning in july faux leather will be segmented into the specialty channel in addition we are creating other specific products for specific channels for example we successfully launched our exclusive field flower pattern with dillard’s and qvc this spring and of course our made for factory or mfo product are a critical piece of this segmentation our third focus is on improving gross margin we believe our innovation and segmentation should generate higher gross margins over time in addition we continue to build a more flexible efficient and cost effective supply chain through vendor and country diversification we have expanded beyond china and are now manufacturing a small amount of product in vietnam and the philippines and exploring other countries as well the closing of our domestic manufacturing facility earlier this year will equate to annual savings of approximately  million beginning in the fourth quarter of this year we have also aggressively renegotiated pricing with all of our mills due to lower cotton and petroleum costs and expect to save  million to  million in cost of sales on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal  rob robert wallstrom thanks sue our distribution strategy remains a key element of our longterm plan we still believe there is ample opportunity for both full line and factory outlet store growth in the future however in the interim until we change the trajectory of our comparable store sales performance we have slowed the growth from our original annual target of  to  full line stores and  to  factory outlet stores we have plans to open  full line stores this year five opened in the first quarter and five will open in each of the second and third quarters seven of these stores will be in the western united states where we are dramatically underrepresented three in metro la two in metro denver and one each in san diego and scottsdale we expect to open  factory outlet stores this year five opened in the first quarter three are opening in the second and three are opening in the third at the end of the first quarter we had  full line stores and  factory outlet stores in fiscal  our current plans are to slow the growth even more to a total of about five to  new stores however over time we still believe there are opportunities to grow our fullline store base to about  and our factory outlet base to approximately  equating to the threetoone ratio we have talked about in the past the first iteration of our new more modern full line store design was introduced in our kierland commons store in scottsdale arizona which opened in march all of our new stores this year will reflect our updated store configuration and design we are receiving positive responses from our customers on the changes the kierland commons store is currently performing better than the closest full line store at biltmore mall in scottsdale so we are encouraged first quarter we initiated our new jersey project and our dallas project focusing on five stores in each geographic area we completed minor store remodels to reflect a more modern esthetic and enhanced our merchandise presentations we are continuing to receive very positive consumer feedback to the improvements and in the aggregate our dallas area stores are now outperforming our houston area locations we believe changes like these are important to enhance our brand perception and to drive more customers into our stores over the long run in our factory stores we are moving faster than expected on our mfo product transition at yearend about  of the merchandise in our factory outlet stores was factory exclusive and we are over  currently we expect this to increase to over  by the fourth quarter we are also beginning to work on our factory outlet branding defining the core value proposition by highlighting the design quality and competitive pricing of our mfo product ecommerce remains an integral component of our long range plan we are in the beginning stages of our  month conversion to a new web technology platform and our site redesign once fully implemented this new platform will allow for a true omnichannel experience for our customers with personalization and segmentation of customer experiences and offers and better management of promotions phase  will be complete in june and we will offer significantly enhanced search capabilities over time this new platform should allow us to better focus on our brand our product story and more full price selling in the meantime we have continued to upgrade the customer experience on the web by adding additional features such as  degree product views and more videos in january we began strategically paring back our hyperpromotional activity that we believe is not sustainable over the long term and is damaging to the brand in the first quarter we eliminated our deepest discounts both on the website and in our full line stores and reduced the number of promotional days by about  this is having an impact on sales but is the right action to take for the longterm health of the business and the brand we expect to continue to pare back promotions going forward there is a lot of excitement and progress being made with our department store relationships which are key to our longterm growth in the indirect segment department stores allow us to expand our exposure and should attract new customers to the brand it is also a great venue to showcase both our traditional and elevated product assortments our department store partners are excited about our product and brand direction we recently added distribution to  additional macy’s stores bringing our total to  our footprint in these stores still averages only about  square feet but we are working to expand our presence in select doors including the  square foot shop in macy’s herald square which will be unveiled in september we are now in seven belk doors we will open a  square foot hard shop in belk’s flagship in the south park mall in charlotte in june and we will test holiday popup shops in about  of their locations later this fall in july we will introduce our products to  bonton stores with an average soft shop size of about  square feet of course dillards and von maur remain special partners for us where we have distribution in all of their doors we continue to get strong interest from other department stores but we are taking a methodical and strategic approach to building a profitable department store business that best represents our brand at this time last year we were in  department stores and currently represented in nearly  department stores in addition this fall we are scheduled to launch our vera bradley shop on amazon the indirect specialty gift channel remains an important and profitable piece of our business we continue to focus on our largest accounts that represent our brand the best however we still aren’t generating the reorders we need for growth our door count remains flat at about  but we are beginning to look for other appropriate specialty store relationships outside of the gift channel such as local highend apparel and accessory stores in the future our segmented product offerings that sue mentioned should have a role in driving specialty store sales and improving their margins now let me shift to marketing which remains one of our most critical focus areas this year as we work to modernize our brand and attract a wider breadth of customers as you know we are investing approximately  million in additional marketing this year with more focus on digital social media and key magazine advertising we intend to increase our effective reach from  million to  million customers particularly focusing on the  to  style conscious demographic on the digital front we are focusing on mobile geotargeting display banner ads and video advertisements a key component of our digital focus is partnering with even more influential social media stylists and bloggers we are also increasing our tv and product placement the majority of which is done for free vera bradley products were spotted on several popular nationally televised shows this january including modern family big bang theory two broke girls and mom our i am advertising campaign will launch in july in conjunction with back to school i am highlights the multifaceted nature of our consumers connecting them and their lives to our brand and products during the testing phase after seeing the campaign potential customers indicated an increased intent to purchase vera bradley with the positive response to the i am campaign in the testing phase we quickly tried to replicate the look and feel of the campaign and place mother’s day ads in the may issues of several fashion magazines including vogue elle and in style due to the quick turnaround the photography styling and overall execution fell short of our expectations the ads did not represent the brand the way we envisioned they should so we are looking forward to improved execution and effectiveness of our i am campaign our marketing efforts will build throughout the year and will hopefully increase awareness and drive new customers to our brand we know it will take time we are anxious for our new cmo to get on board so that she can evaluate our plans and determine what enhancements we can make to improve productivity and return on investment operator we will now open up the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we’ll first go to ed yruma with keybanc capital markets ed yruma hi good morning thanks for taking my question just a quick update on some of your replatformed stores i think you did one in new jersey are you seeing a different level of performance in those stores that you’ve touched and remerchandised versus rest of fleet robert wallstrom good morning ed yes in terms of new jersey what we’re seeing in new jersey and dallas first overall is customer feedback has been incredibly positive what they’ve been telling us is that both the new merchandising as well as the refurbishing allows them to see the product much clearer it’s also attracting a new customer to the brand but where we’re seeing the biggest results from a sales impact are on the new merchandising standards so for example we did a new travel wall that we implemented in the stores and we’ve seen a nice lift in the travel assortments and we’ve begun to roll that out to all of our stores we instituted a backpack merchandising wall that also was very successful that we’ve moved out across the store so we continue to see again here positive response from our customers beginning to get pieces of it that are really working and we’re continuing to refine that ed yruma got it and two quick followups i guess first i know you had planned incentive comp to be up pretty meaningfully yearoveryear i guess given the results has that changed and was there any kind of an accrual reversal and then i guess the bigger picture question i understand you don’t want to give usyou’re not going to give us any updates on the longterm guidance but i guess what kind of markers should we be looking for in this period of turn to assume or understand if you’re kind of hitting some of your internal objectives or making progress against some of these goals that you’ve outlined thank you kevin sierks let me start with the first one with regards to compensation you’re exactly right  that did come down we expected to have to hurdle about  million this year from a compensation perspective compared to last year that number is now down to about  million to  million so that is reflected in our guidance robert wallstrom in terms of key markers two different ways of looking at it first of all the most important one is going to be seeing an increase in the comp sales performance as we go forward that will be the first place we really feel great that the consumer is responding in the interim the markers that we’re looking at there are a few different ones first of all the performance of all of the new products that we’re introducing and again during first quarter our new products met our planned expectations which was encouraging as well as all of the feedback we’ve been receiving from customer focus groups so the response to the new product is one key marker another key marker we talked about the role of factory and mfo exclusives and as we discussed we’ve been exceeding what our plans were in terms of penetration of mfo and seeing very nice margin flowthrough from mfo expansion so that is another one the third area that we will begin to track against is watching as the marketing gets out watching the brand awareness and increasing the brand awareness particularly of the new product categories those are the areas that we’re focusing on ed yruma got it thanks so much guys operator we’ll go next to oliver chen with cowen  company oliver chen hi thanks for the transparency i just had a bigger picture question on the state of the business when you think about the needs between marketing versus product and speed i wanted your thoughts on where you see the bigger opportunity just because it does sound like your product plan is attractive in terms of where you’re headed but it sounds like you’re solving for this overall traffic and awareness and demand creation then i know you just mentioned vera bradley on amazon i was just wondering how this fits into your channel strategy and how products might be segmented there versus both your bricks and mortar and online thank you robert wallstrom i want to make sure i get that question right oliver and thank you for it but in terms of what we’re focusing on right now you’re right that the number one issue is building awareness that the  million that we’ve invested in marketing is really critical we laid out a plan at the beginning of the year which we’re executing to we obviously have theresa who is joining us and i think theresa brings a lot of great skills to the team particularly working at retail brands and having more of a true crm program in place and a great balance between creative and analytical she is really going to focus on how do we build the buzz and awareness of what we’re doing out in the community much faster particularly through pr and how do we leverage pr and social media in the interim as we are still implementing our  million marketing investment so that really is the critical initiative this year as we’ve talked about the unfolding of our plan that marketing is definitely key to building the awareness because we believe that the product has started to get to where we need it to be we’ve received a lot of great response we think we’re going to continue to innovate sue and the team are doing a great job of driving innovation and we will continue to innovate but we do believe that the primary focus is building awareness regarding amazonyes go ahead oliver chen indiscernible are you feeling like traffic is indiscernible across all the channels or are there channels you’re moreyou see bigger opportunity for improvement there as marketing indiscernible impact robert wallstrom yes we definitely are seeing traffic really across all of the channels right now being challenging it is interesting though  for example in our department store environment where traffic is much more stable our business is stronger within the department store channel which again speaks to the importance of getting consumers in so we do expect that where we should see the first influx of traffic would be through our ecommerce site followed by our own full line stores one of the pieces that we have to break down in ecommerce though is that hyperpromotion has been a primary traffic driver and we are severely dialing that back so that is one lever we’re pulling off of ecommerce as we begin to build awareness to get a new full price customer in so that one is a little bit indiscernible to look at the macro traffic number we have to look underneath it and separate out the hyperpromotional traffic from the full price traffic oliver chen thank you and if you could talk about the amazon topic that would be great robert wallstrom yes as we look at all of our channels of distribution we definitely are looking at product segmentation and the product that amazon will go up with is definitely a limited assortment and we’ve made sure that it’s really focused on kind of our freshest product and our newest product again we believe the number one thing we need to do is get in front of a new consumer we need to let new consumers see our product and obviously with amazon’s very large reach we feel it’s an opportunity to put our product in front of new customers and that’s what we’re really using it for is a marketing reach kevin sierks yes and oliver from a sales perspective we obviously expect it to be fairly small this year and it will be in the indirect segment from a segment perspective if you’re looking at modeling oliver chen okay and kevin just a final question as we model it sounded like you’re on track to introduce some good products where is inventory what does it do to your net working capital this year and are there any guidelines for the cash flow from operations this year in terms of indiscernible kevin sierks yes we definitely expect to grow inventory this year and obviously profitability is down so from a working capital perspective generally speaking i expect it to be negative this year mainly because of inventory growth in the back half of the year to support a lot of the new fabrications and the new product that’s working we don’t give guidance for the full year but you can obviously expect it to be much lower than last year and even lower than the prior couple years from an operating cash flow perspective and free cash flow perspective then as far as inventory oliver our current or retired inventory continues to get more and more positive we moved a lot of our liquidation inventory last year so if you look at the health of our inventory that’s not something keeping us up at night this year like it maybe was last year we continue to improve assorting by channel as well and sue and team have done a great job improving there over the long term we expect inventory to grow with sales but this will be the sixth quarter here in q where inventory has actually grown less than sales or actually been reduced actually quarter over quarter so expect in q and then in q for inventory to start to grow slightly higher than sales oliver chen okay great thanks for the color and the details on the freshness thank you robert wallstrom thank you oliver operator we’ll go to ike boruchow with sterne agee tom nikic hey guys it’s actually tom nikic on for ike thanks for taking our questions just a bit of housekeeping i think i may have missed the guidance for the indirect sales in q would you mind just repeating what the guidance was for q kevin sierks sure no problem it’s down high single digits to low teens tom nikic okay got it okay now my actual question so your gross margin guidance seems to imply a lot of improvement in the back half of the year i understand some of it is the mfo penetration and some of it is the pullback in promotions but what continues to give you confidence that you get hundreds of basis points of gross margin in the back half of the year given some of the top line trends that you’re having and some of the difficulty on the top line thanks kevin sierks yes good question tom the real thing we saw in q which sue mentioned on the call is we’ve seen a lot of good success with mfo not only is it selling very well from a productivity perspective we’re seeing a  to  higher margin on that product and our penetration is a lot higher so we felt we’d be at around  to  in the quarter and we’re actually north of  in the quarter now we expect it to go above  as we get to q so mfo alone is over a percent  it’s about  improvement this year compared to last year so that’s the single largest item another thing is just closing our domestic manufacturing here in town a lot of that hits in q but some of it does hit early in the year just because we reduced second shift back in october so that’s beginning to benefit us here in q so we’ll get about call it  basis points improvement from the manufacturing facility being shut down the remaining call it percent is really around some operating efficiencies that came down a little bit compared to our original expectations because sue and i toned down our purchases of inventory in the back half of the year to more align with sales so that came down a little bit you can call that half a percent and then we expect about half a percent from less promotions or less liquidation sales so that’s really that approximately  improvement we expect to get this year compared to last year some of thatyou know mfo pretty high confidence level on mfo operating efficiencies that could move a little bit but the domestic manufacturing is all shut down and wrapped up so a lot of that is pretty much baked in at this point in time tom nikic got it thanks just one quick followup  so you said five to  stores next stores being open next year is that combined between the two channels or is that in each channel full price and outlook robert wallstrom combined tom nikic combined  okay great thank you operator we’ll go to mark altschwager with robert w baird mark altschwager good morning thanks for taking the question first one is on the competitive environment the handbag space is looking more promotional than it was a year ago how is this impacting your view of the white space opportunity from a price point perspective robert wallstrom mark thanks for the question i think we’re definitely hearing obviously in the handbag space that a lot of our competitors are beginning to look at promotions and trying to pull back we definitely are looking at that white space and looking at the promotional impact but we still believe there’s really opportunity particularly with the introduction of the new wildwood leather collection you can see that we’re filling in those price points and bringing some price points down as well as the introduction of these new fabrics we think really fit in this kind of  to  price range which we believe is where the big white space is as opposed to the above  mark altschwager okay that’s helpful thank you following up on the indirect channel lots of puts and takes there with the success with the department stores offset by some of the changes with the specialty accounts bigger picture is there a steady state revenue level you would anticipate in that channel moving beyond fiscal ’ and then specifically how have these liquidation sales and the department store expansion in recent quarters impacted the specialty relationships kevin sierks i’ll let rob talk about the relationships a little bit but with regards to the numbers we still expect a modest decline in the specialty channel in terms of number of doors we exited the quarter with about  doors it was only slightly down from yearend which was a pleasant surprise to us but we still expect some modest decline there as far as stabilization we are looking to add additional doors especially in the specialty apparel area so we’re looking for that to somewhat offset some of that modest decline in the gift channel doors but as far as stabilization we haven’t seen it yet you can see the guidance obviously  we still expect it to be down in the back half of the year obviously we’re looking to stabilize that as soon as possible we just haven’t seen it yet mark robert wallstrom i’ll answer the question about the relationships first of all i believe the relationships between us and our specialty gift partners continues to strengthen there is a lot of things that we’re doing to address their core concerns one of the core concerns is that we needed to really work on giving them segmented products so that they could improve their margin have exclusive product and sue and the team have done a great job of developing that and they’ve been very excited about that we saw them begin to market their exclusives maybe microfiber which they had earlier in the spring which really helped some of our partners turn around their business so the ones that are jumping on the exclusive product are seeing some nice results so that’s one thing we’ve done the other thing that they’ve asked us to do is really pull back on the hyperpromotional discounts the level of promotional discounts that we’ve been running as a company over the last few years are not sustainable for them and it was definitely a big factor in our decision to pull down that promotional activity and we’ve taken very aggressive steps in the first quarter and are ramping up those efforts as we get to the back half of the year so those were two of the major ones that we were focusing on obviously as we were liquidating last year and running deep discounts that did cause frustration on the specialty environment but they understood that we needed to do that to get our inventories clean so they kind of endured that then we’re also working with them as we open up these department stores to make our lines in both channels more exclusive so that they’re not competing headtohead we believe both can operate effectively a lot of the pressure that the specialty stores have seen recently is the same pressure that we’ve seen in our full line stores and that’s really due to the need for new product innovation and as we begin to get that into the stores we’re beginning to see some stabilization particularly for the accounts that are much more aggressive in going after the new product the ones that are not moving as aggressively on the new product are not recovering as well mark altschwager thanks for all that additional color and best of luck robert wallstrom thank you operator as a reminder it’s star one to ask a question we’ll go to eric beder with wunderlich eric beder good morning could you talk a little bit about in terms of the department stores what kind of product offerings you want to give them in terms of the leather product and where do you see that channel becoming more or less important going forward sue fuller eric it’s sue i’ll take the question so we do see department stores playing an important role particularly as we introduce new innovation of leather as well as our brand new poly tulle and preppy poly we have completed some of our markets and we are in fact seeing those placements take place so we do believe that they are an important structure in order to change the perception of the brand and to make sure that the new innovation is in front of the consumer that is walking in that door eric beder are you seeing any cannibalization in the malls where you have department stores that have taken on the product and your own stores or is it a different customer base looking at these robert wallstrom we have not seen cannibalization in our own stores and as a matter of fact we’ve evenand talking to our department stores it works kind of the same way that when we open a store where we already have a department store distribution they don’t see any cannibalization either so we definitely believe that there’s synergy between our own stores and the department stores eric beder okay on the incremental  million marketing spend where are the buckets going to go in terms of where you’re going to put the meatiest spend in terms of online magazines and other areas how should we think about that kevin sierks primarily we’re focused on digital first and foremost so that’s where the majority of that spend is going to go obviously we have theresa joining us in a few weeks and she may change this a little bit but digital first and foremost also increasing spend in terms of social media and pr pretty significantly this year that hasn’t been a focus for us over the years so we’re definitely looking to increase that including potential ambassadors which we obviously have one already and then print as well  you’ll see us in a lot of different magazines we mentioned on the call a few of them that we were in but we’re in fashion magazines such as vogue and teen vogue et cetera we’re in better homes and gardens shape real simple seventeen et cetera so you’ll see us in print throughout the year as well eric beder great thank you and good luck for the rest of the year robert wallstrom thank you operator we’ll go to neely tamminga with piper jaffray neely tamminga great good morning  neely tamminga rob can we just step back just a little bit on this and almost arc back maybe to our analyst event could you help us think through this so the company built itself into a half billion dollar brand with basically great design authenticity and word of mouth and over the last three years and understanding you’re coming in here batting cleanup a little bit right but over the last three years you’re basically heading into three years of revenue declines so we hear from you you want to talk about awareness and raising awareness could you just help us ground that assessment around what some of the key metrics are around unaided awareness or aided awareness or how your newtofile is tracking with some of these newer product initiatives that go outside the core we’re just trying to better fully understand the progress on raising awareness right now thanks robert wallstrom great question thank you first of all when you think about this whole issue of awareness when we talk about awareness there’s two pieces of it one is just brand awareness as you say  do they know vera bradley which is one piece of it but as important it’s what does vera bradley stand for and what we found in our latest research is that the consumer still equates vera bradley with cotton quilted pattern bags and we definitely know from a fashion standpoint that it doesn’t have the same resonance that it did before so we need to expand the consumer’s awareness of what vera bradley represents and what we’re finding in these focus groups and we held focus groups in three major cities in the us and what we found is when we showed them the new product it really resonated with them but they weren’t aware that it was there they had a notion that vera bradley was good when they had a backpack or good when they bought a duffle but once they bought their cotton quilted one they didn’t need another cotton quilted one but when they began to see all these new products they were excited and much more apt to come back and visit the store and make an additional purchase so it’s really building awareness around a fuller product offering that we have more fabrications more solids more styles that can fit into her current life so when we talk about awareness it’s a little bit deeper than just brand awareness but what they’re aware of we are finding that the new consumers coming into our file are reacting to the new product we are finding that the new product is bringing in the new consumer that more of their purchase or more of their cart is focused on the new product than the core product so we are seeing that resonance our overall brand awareness is still high in terms of people have heard of vera bradley except when you go to the west coast but they don’t understand what we offer and that’s what we have to build is the awareness of our offering neely tamminga thank you and could you just bridge that then with the strategy at outlet so the success that i think we’re hearing around the made for outlet strategy are those mfo products primarily in what you consider the traditional more quilted pattern or does it also encompass the newness that you’ve been bringing out there to broaden the awareness of the vera bradley spectrum so help us now arc that to the mfo strategy thanks robert wallstrom yes absolutely in terms of mfo we always expect mfo to follow but not be concurrent with our full line strategy so what does that mean currently the vast majority of the mfo product that is in our outlet is in the core cotton quilted program we have begun to introduce microfiber into the outlet channel which is doing exceptionally well and outselling the core cotton so there’s definitely a need for newness in our factory channel also we are also beginning the development of these other fabrications into our mfo strategy but we want to make sure that whatever we take into our mfo strategy is highly differentiated from our full price offering because we obviously want to make sure that we’re maintaining a very strong fashion presence in our full line stores and a reason to buy full price but you will begin to see these fabrics over the next year as some of them begin to trail into our outlet neely tamminga great thank you operator we’ll go to steve marotta with cl king  associates steve marotta good morning everyone thank you for all the detail on the call i just have one question as it pertains specifically to your marketing plans between now and the holiday season so that would be obviously summer back to school and holiday what specifically are you doing to endeavor to increase traffic to the stores is there anything that you can talk about  direct mailers anything to drive additional traffic to your companyowned stores thank you robert wallstrom thank you steve first of all the total campaign as we look at the  million we definitely are continuing to invest that as we go through the third and fourth quarters obviously in the third quarter it has a very strong back to school focus but it is a combination of a lot of digital advertisement a lot of working with blogs and the social media world as well as looking at pr opportunities because what we believe we really need to do is get people talking about vera bradley again we think it’s the most important thing then we also are working on a localized basis we’ve been testing some local kind of mallbased marketing in dallas which we’re starting to get some good initial results on in terms of really working locally with the malls to drive consumers into our stores so i would say there’s really a twopart strategy but the vast majority of it is built upon building brand awareness and getting consumers to talk about us again steve marotta okay thank you operator we’ll go to dana telsey with telsey advisory group dana telsey good morning everyone as you think about some of the marketing that you have done the i am campaign and the testing phase and you mentioned that execution fell short of expectations what changed from what you had expected at the beginning the difference between the testing and the execution and just lastly when you talk about the indirect retailers the specialty retailers what are they seeing in termswhat feedback are they giving you and with their order reductions how do you see that progressing throughout the year thank you robert wallstrom thank you dana first of all let me talk about i am just to make sure that we’re really clear what happened is that we had the i am campaign set to launch for back to school and because we had received such good feedback angel had tried to work with the agency to scramble and move that all the way up to mother’s day in that scramble he worked directly with the agency and placed advertising in national magazines that nobody else had seen and our agency just was not able to execute it that quickly so we put advertising out in the market that did not truly align with i am i would not really say that the mother’s day campaign was the i am campaign that still really focused on back to school so it was really a matter of rushing and having the person who was steering that not have the same creative focus as we really had envisioned for the brand but obviously that’s changed we have a new cmo in place who we feel is definitely aligned with the creative execution and so we feel much better about how we’ll be able to execute that going forward so that’s really the i am campaign but you’ll begin to see the real flavour of i am as you get into back to school in july going into fall and september that’s really where that focus is kevin sierks and then dana with regards to the indirect segment in total anyway which we gave guidance on of being down in the high single digits to low teens keep in mind we had about  million of revenue that went into q this year which was in q last year so you can tell that number that guidance number for q is obviously much better than what we had in q and then as you get into q and q in the back half of the year we still expect obviously it to be similar to what the q guidance is as you look at the full year guidance for the indirect segment robert wallstrom what we’re hearing from that channel and it’s been interesting because we’ve been spending a lot of time  sue myself barb everybody has been out with them listening to them and we keep asking them what are their customers saying what do they want us to do and what they say overwhelmingly is that you have to continue to evolve the product that what happened with your brand is that for too long you did not evolve the product and then you started to use hyperpromotions to drive business so we are addressing both of those things very aggressively they’re very excited about the new product direction and they continue to say their customers are commenting positively but there’s a lack of awareness out there and they’re saying it’s going to take time to build that awareness so keep pursuing the path that you’re on they keep pushing us  move faster to reduce the promotional activity the hyperpromotional activity which is exactly what we’re doing so we believe that we’re on the right path but it is taking some time to see the fruits of that strategic implementation dana telsey perfect thank you very much robert wallstrom thank you dana operator this does conclude today’s question and answer session i will now turn it back to you for any additional or closing remarks robert wallstrom thank you i continue to be extremely proud of the progress that our team has made over the past year we are transforming our product assortments modernizing our stores evolving our outlet stores to a factory outlet model improving our online shopping experience adding important department store relationships and ramping up our marketing efforts it will take time for these efforts to pay off but i believe all of these are the right steps to attract new customers to our brand and for the future of the business thank you for joining us today and for your interest time and questions we look forward to speaking to you on our second

to vera bradley and for all that he has done for our company kevin will be leaving the company at the end of this month and we have appointed john enwright our vp of financial planning and analysis as interim cfo we wish kevin all the best the retail environment became even more challenging in the fourth quarter consequently both total revenues and our gross profit percentage were modestly below our expectations however we exceeded our fourth quarter eps guidance primarily due to diligent expense management in the lower than expected tax rate even though fiscal  was a challenging year we made meaningful progress against key elements of our longterm strategic plan in product we continue to create beautiful solutions for our target customer through functionality and innovation in our core classifications of fashion bags and accessories travel and campus and continue to add product categories to enhance our lifestyle such as in home and beauty expanded our collegiate initiative to represent over  schools and announced six licensing agreements in the areas of bedding hosiery swim tech stationery and publishing for products that will debut throughout  these products should increase our brand exposure allow us to attract new customers provide additional distribution and drive traffic to our digital flagship in distribution we opened four fullline stores all in our new modern store design including our flagship store in soho and our highest traffic and volume store in disney springs in orlando completed the remodel of our jefferson pointe store in our hometown of fort wayne refreshed  of our higher traffic higher volume fullline stores with our new branding including storefront facade logo and interior changes and rebranded the facades of our  newest fullline stores so that about a third of our fleet now reflects our new logo and signage opened six factory outlet stores continued to make improvements to verabradleycom preparing for the relaunch of our digital flagship which was completed in february  and added additional distribution to approximately  macys belk and bonton department stores our marketing efforts drove customer engagement by increasing brand visibility and igniting a social movement with our multifaceted ‘its good to be a girl campaign and intensified emphasis on influencers social mobile and video content and generating over  million impressions a nearly fold increase over last year through national ads editorial content and gift guidance such publications as people stylewatch instyle glamour and seventeen and even appearing in oprah’s favorite things holiday gift guide online and digital ads on hulu pandora and the conde nast network and increased influencer and celebrity marketing in addition our balance sheet remained strong we carefully managed our inventories made strategic systems and other capital improvements repurchased over  million in common stocks and it ended the year with a very solid cash position and no debt we have a strong brand a talented team and a solid financial foundation and our focus on ensuring vera bradleys prosperous future however our transformation is taking longer than we had originally planned and the overall retail environment and accessories pace are significantly more challenging than anticipated we expect this year to be another challenging year but we remain keenly focused on the future and the longterm health and growth of the business of course we will continually challenge our cost structure and look for ways to work more efficiently and effectively while continuing to invest in areas of the business that will drive revenue growth as we enter fiscal  our number one goal is to grow our customer count we must drive more traffic into our stores and into verabradleycom in order to do this we have three primary areas of focus number one drive brand desirability through robust marketing program number two drive product desirability through focusing on our core assortment and strategically leveraging licensing opportunities to expand the brand reach number three strengthen our distribution network focusing on driving comparable sales in our core businesses including continuing to strengthen our digital flagship and relocating or closing underperforming stores we believe diligently focusing on these three areas will best position vera bradley for longterm revenue and income growth we will delve into these a bit more after kevin gives us a brief update on our fourth quarter and fiscal year results and our outlook for fiscal  kevin kevin sierks thanks rob and good morning let me go over a few highlights for the quarter current and prior year fourth quarter income statement numbers that i will reference exclude the previously mentioned

key accounts gross profit for the quarter totaled  million or  of net revenues compared to  million or  of net revenues in the prior year the  basis point gross profit percentage decline primarily related to increased promotional activity at our companys factory outlet stores which also caused the gross profit percentage to fall modestly below the lowend of our guidance range of  to  excluding store impairment charges sga expense totaled  million or  of net revenues in the current year fourth quarter compared to  million or  of net revenues last year sga dollars decreased over the prior

respectively capital spending for the fiscal year was generally in line with guidance of  million during the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately  million worth of common stock equating to

inventory was  million compared to  million at last fiscal yearend and in line with our guidance of  million to  million now let’s talk about our fiscal  outlook for the first quarter and full year our guidance reflects the extremely challenging retail and competitive landscape we remain in a highly unpredictable environment keep in mind that as i discuss our prior year comparisons the prior year numbers excludes the store impairment and other charges outlined in today’s release and financial statement attachments current year estimates do not include any store closing impairment or other charges for the first quarter we expect net revenues of  million to  million compared to prior year first quarter revenues of  million we expect direct segment net revenues to be down in the lowtomid single digit range compared to the prior year included in our comparable sales decreases including the website and the midtohigh single digit percentage range we believe our indirect net revenues will be down in the midtohigh teen range during the quarter the gross profit percentage for the first quarter is expected to range from  to  compared to  in the prior year first quarter the planned decline reflects an expected increased level of promotional activity as well as channel mix changes that is a larger percentage of our sales coming from the lower margin factory channel sga as a percentage of net revenues is expected to range from  to  for the first quarter compared to  in the prior year first quarter the deleverage is primarily due to expected soft sales in the quarter we expect first quarter diluted loss per share before charges to be in the range of  to  net income totaled  million or  per diluted share in the prior year first quarter we expect inventory to be  million to  million range at the end of the first quarter compared to  million at the end last year for the full year we expect net revenues of  million to  million compared to  million last year our revenue guidance assumes direct segment net revenue to be relatively flat to up low single digits compared to last year with comparable sales including ecommerce down in the low to mid single digit percentage range in direct net revenues our expected decline in the midtohigh teen percentage range for the full year the gross profit percentage for fiscal  is expected to range from  to  compared to  last year the expected decline relates to increased promotional activity and channel mix changes partially offset by planned overhead savings sga as a percentage of net revenues is expected to range from  to  for fiscal  compared to  last year the planned increase relates to the annualization of new store expenses incremental incentive compensation related to resetting targets and incremental depreciation associated with the new digital flagship in addition deleverage is expected due to soft sales we expect diluted eps excluding charges for the full fiscal year to range from  to  before charges diluted eps totaled  last year we expect our net capital expenditures will total approximately  million to  million for the full year primarily related to new factory store openings fullline store renovations and continued technology investments let me turn the call over to rob who will give you an update on our focused areas for fiscal  rob robert wallstrom thanks kevin as i noted earlier our number one priority for fiscal  is to grow our customer counts we simply must drive more traffic into our stores and into verabradleycom we will achieve that by one increasing our brand desirability two increasing our product desirability and three strengthening our distribution platform let me go into a bit of detail in each of these first lets talk about driving branded desirability which largely revolves around our holistic marketing efforts we believe our brand is in a solid position to move forward our initial brand reboot including the logo change and our fall  marketing campaign began to positively shift purchase intent and brands intent we are building a robust innovative and multifaceted marketing program expanding upon our successful “its good to be a girl” campaign introduced last

marketing analytics to optimize our media spend personalize our consumers experience and increase conversion we are laser focused on media that will increase customer count second we will enhance our product desirability we will continue to major in the majors that is our five core focused categories of fashion bags and accessories travel campus wellness and beauty and home and especially exploit the growth of our top  best selling items were continuing to build and expand our focus on beautiful solutions through our product design presentations signage hangtags and marketing thoughtfully offering beautiful solutions incorporates added functionality in innovation into our core classifications such as charging pockets and rfid blocking technology that will be fully integrated into all appropriate products by the end of the year we are reinvigorating our core heritage through reinventing the most important piece of our business cotton with the introduction of our fall  collection which features are new micro quilting as well as some other unique quilting and stitching patterns we will also continue to add new more modern silhouettes and of course focus on pattern and design pattern strength continues to be as critical as quilted cotton might not make up over  of our direct sales brand extensions are an important part of offering our target customer newness diversification and beautiful solutions we are strategically layering in licensing opportunities where appropriate the swim bedding stationary and hosiery collections will launch this summer and we are already seeing a very positive response from the market in terms of placement in both existing and new distribution we expect to add even more categories in the future lastly we will strengthen our distribution platform by pivoting from a growth mode to focusing on our core channels and on driving comp sales most importantly we will continue to evolve our verabradleycom digital first strategy which we believe is our unique to longterm growth the relaunch of our digital flagship platform went live just last month this new platform offers an enhanced ease of shopping and incremental functionality including an upgrade of mobile experience additional navigation and searching enhancements improved product pages with enhanced imagery product videos and user generated content and new capabilities like egift cards and order online pickup in store the new platform also gives us capabilities to create deeper customer relationships and create value to more personalized and strategic customization we will strengthen our fullline store base we will continue with our fullline store upgrades so that approximately half of our  stores will feature a new modern design standards by the end of the fiscal year we will focus on enhancing performance of our top stores through must have key items superb visual and instore execution the improved discipline and accountability and engaging instore events in addition we will relocate or close upto  targeted underperforming fullline stores as leases expire or as we are able to negotiate early exits over the next  months or so we closed our fifth largest store on january  we will strengthen our  store factory base through more disciplined differentiated products and strategic promotions we plan on opening approximately six new factory stores this year with three in the first quarter in laredo texas myrtle beach south carolina and houston texas our goal is to build and execute a healthy less promotional and symbiotic distribution plan between our  department stores and  specialty stores in the department stores we will continue to work on enhancing standards and brand presentation to focus on key item intensification and travel and to expand our lifestyle brand offerings we will build a specialty store distribution plan with a bydoor ph analysis and longterm distribution strategy as you can see we have another busy year ahead operator we will now open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we’ll go first to oliver chen with cowen and company q –stiller dennis hi this is stiller dennis ph for oliver thank you for taking our question could you just share your thoughts on which channel you feel faces the biggest challenge or hurdles to overcome first is which channel likely presents the greatest opportunity to drive improvements sooner or issues are likely more within your control and easier to address then on that note could you also just highlight some of the key positive catalyst that you expect to drive better performance in the back half of the year robert wallstrom yeah absolutely let me jump in our number one focus for channel in future growth we really believe is the digital space so the relaunch of our verabradleycom we really are very very focused on improving our full price positioning improving our brand story and really using that as a catalyst for future growth so we believe that that is the number one area and the number one area where we know the customers experience our brand in terms of as we look at the back half of the year we have a lot of strategies in place between getting the marketing campaign kicked off in first quarter and continuing to build throughout the year we believe that the ecommerce business will continue to strengthen as we get the new platform in place and consumers take advantage of all of the new functionality that we’ve built in in addition just as we look at the back half of the year we also have the new cotton collection that is launching which really is bringing increased functionality some fresh design and really increased focus on our core product assortment which we believe all of those things will help us lift our sales as we move through the year q – stiller dennis thank you operator we’ll go next to drew north with robert w baird drew north good morning thanks for taking the question regarding your store closures or relocation plan it sounded like that is mostly focused on the full price business which would push the overall mix toward the factory stores how are you thinking about the right mix of the full price business and factory overtime and then how do you plan to balance that higher factory mix with your efforts to drive greater brand and product desirability moving forward robert wallstrom yeah thank you for the question drew a couple of things you are right that the store closure is focused more on our fullline mix right now in terms of our factory channel we continue to have very positive contribution from our factory stores as we look going forward we definitely continue to look at the balance between the two and that is something that we are constantly evaluating because we’ve stated that we want to make sure that the ratio in terms of full line to factory ideally is at least two to one then we believe with the digital focus moving more to full price but thats really the key we believe that the digital space focusing on brand and product as opposed to price is the primary driver is really key to driving our brand desirability and product desirability as we go forward drew north great thank you and then if i could squeeze one more in just on a rd week can you quantify the revenue and the eps impact related to that period kevin sierks sure drew its really only a few million dollars and its less than  to eps so its not a big impact for us this year but it is in our guidance drew north okay thank you operator our next question comes from eric beder with wunderlich eric beder good morning could you talk a little bit about the new advertising campaign and the new rebranding and what kind of it showed you in the stores and logos how the consumer was responding to it sue fuller sure i’d be happy to weve been very pleased with overall consumer response to our new advertising campaign as well as to our new logos so we’ve heard some consumers that they liked the rebranding they feel like it’s a really new look for the brand and then that they find it very relatable so we’re excited robert wallstrom we also found in third quarter as we put our marketing campaign out there and really led with “its good to be a girl” and really put the brand first that we had a very positive response from consumers and we saw increased engagement across social channels influencers as well as traffic in our stores we’re really leveraging that focus as we go into this year which is part of what gives us the confidence in the marketing impact as we go to this year because we feel that we found the right place to really focus our energies and we think that the girl starter partnership is a great example of doing that eric beder okay and just one more in terms of the impact on the stores what was kind of where the new rebranded stores doing better in holiday season than the nonrebranded and kind of how should we think about the pace that the rebranding for this year robert wallstrom yeah what we were hearing from consumers we did a lot of customer research and listening to consumers in terms of the new store format and really continue to receive very positive feedback that they felt it was kind of updated and more modern still keeping within the heritage still celebrating the heritage of vera bradley so we received very positive consumer response in terms of the dramatic performance difference we didnt see a huge difference in the overall sales of our new branded stores but we did see a lot of positive customer feedback so thats one reason why were continuing to go through with the rebranding effort and we will have over half of our stores that will be in the new brand but at the same time were making sure that we pace it appropriately eric beder okay thank you and good luck for the year robert wallstrom thank you operator operator instructions we’ll go to bill dezellem with tieton capital management william dezellem thank you did i hear correctly that disney springs store is your number one selling store if that is correct are there other opportunities where you can create a unique design for another entity that really ties similarly to the way that the disney design is working for you robert wallstrom bill you did hear correctly our disney springs store is our number one volume store it is our highest traffic store it’s a great partnership between who are the core disney customers as well as the core vera bradley customer b product that we design in partnership with disney is part of that and is part of that success but the vast majority of the stores volume is still coming out of our core product so i think the lessons that we’re taking from that is looking for one of those really unique entertainment shopping opportunities that are high traffic weve always talked about for us we are a traffic brand getting people through our stores is really critical to what we do and so finding the right type of opportunities where you’re seeing high traffic becomes very critical for us obviously out there in the retail landscape right now finding destinations with high traffic is definitely not as easy as it once was but it’s definitely something that were very focused on as we look at real estate going forward william dezellem thanks for the clarification rob operator we’ll go next to ed yruma with keybanc capital markets matt douglas hi this is matt douglas on for ed i’m wondering about the relationship between physical and online retail so after the rebrand the store did you see a meaningful uptick ecommerce sales in that geographic area also how much do you believe if you do end up closing a full price this year how much do you believe of those sales you can recapture from ecommerce or potentially other channels thank you robert wallstrom matt thank you for the question in terms of significant major uplift in ecommerce business in the markets that weve rebranded the stores we’re not seeing dramatic change in the ecommerce business in terms of as we’re closing in stores we are working to definitely migrate our consumer into our other locations were starting out with that fibs in atlanta to really make sure that were managing customerbycustomer and whether thats moving into another one of our fullline stores whether its inventory ecommerce business or one of our specialty or department store partners we’re working through that process and we know that will be important as we look at closing kind of the  stores over the next two years we’re obviously working through that process we expect that the majority of that closing will happen more towards the end of this year going into next year just to kind of put that in perspective matt douglas thank you operator with no further questions in the queue i’d like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks robert wallstrom thank you we know we still have a lot of work to do but we’re confident we are on the right path and have the financial strength to transform vera bradley into a stronger company we will continue to work diligently to improve our performance and enhance shareholder value thank you for joining us today we look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter call on may st operator
