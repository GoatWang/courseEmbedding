dear fellow shareholders thank you for investing with state farm mutual funds® enclosed is the annual report for the month period ended november   in this report you will find management’s discussion of investment philosophy and process for each of the funds offered by the trust factors that affected each fund’s performance over the month period and benchmark index comparisons that are designed to put that performance into context i’m happy to report that all four funds had positive total returns for the month period ended november   of course the financial market each fund invested in influenced the fund’s performance equity markets as represented by the large cap sp  index produced positive total returns of  for the month period ended november   supported by growth in overall corporate earnings and gross domestic product gdp as well as a steady employment environment however investors were confronted by a significant level of volatility throughout the period many factors both positive and negative contributed to the volatility including continuing weakness in the housing market lackluster consumer spending higher energy prices and actions by the federal reserve a primary contributor to the volatility however was driven by concerns of rising defaults on subprime mortgages those made to the riskiest borrowers with the increase in subprime mortgage defaults many lenders tightened their lending requirements during the summer months of  which at the time prompted fears of a “credit crunch” that could potentially cause adverse ripple effects to the overall economy in response to these issues as well as other economic factors the federal reserve reduced the federal discount rate by  in august followed by subsequent reductions to the federal funds rate of  in september and  in october respectively bond markets as represented by the year us treasury bond yield also advanced during the month period ended november   as all the uncertainty surrounding the subprime mortgage issues and resulting credit tightening helped spur a flight to quality driving prices on us treasuries higher and rates lower the yield on year us treasuries rose from  in december   to a peak of  on june   before declining  basis points to end at  on november   shortterm yields experienced an even more dramatic move down with year us treasuries declining  basis points from a peak of  on june   to  on november   also included for your review are audited financial statements and a complete list of portfolio holdings to help you further understand the funds you own we encourage

investment objective and philosophy the state farm growth fund is managed with a longterm investment orientation our investment process is based on a rigorous fundamental analysis of companies we focus on risk as well as the potential for reward we look for wellmanaged companies with a niche or business specialty that serves an appropriatelysized market opportunity we prefer companies with a strong customer focus and a history of prudent financial decisions we also believe that dividends are an important part of an investment’s total return and therefore prefer companies that pay a regular dividend while we are conscious of how the fund’s portfolio differs from our broadbased benchmark the sp  index we don’t make decisions based upon the index describe the relevant market environment as it related to the fund for the reporting period the market environment was influenced by numerous factors including rising commodity prices a weakening us dollar relative to other major currencies a continued slow down in the housing market rising concerns of defaults on subprime mortgages and the federal reserve’s decision to lower the federal funds rate rising oil prices continued to be a factor throughout the year oil prices began the period at approximately barrel and touched highs of over barrel in midnovember before slipping to below barrel by the end of november  albeit still up over  for the month period the us dollar fell against the nation euro during the period amid concerns over the health of the us economy stoked by the subprime credit crisis for the period december  through november  the us dollar fell approximately  to euro versus the british pound the us dollar fell over  during the period to £ with the rising concerns of defaults on us subprime mortgages and the general tightening of credit the federal reserve responded to market conditions with two rate cuts during the latter months of  at the september  federal open market committee fomc meeting the fed cut the federal funds rate by  from  to  citing its intention to forestall adverse effects from the financial markets disruptions caused by the housing correction in late october the fed again reduced the federal funds rate this time by  to  as of november   the federal funds rate of  is down  from december  despite these factors the month total return for the sp  index was  for the period ended november   corporate earnings per share grew modestly while priceearnings valuations for the sp  index companies expanded slightly provide an illustration of the fund’s investments

return of  after expenses and with dividends reinvested compared to a  return for the sp  index the line graph below provides additional perspective on the fund’s long term results the performance data quoted above represents past performance and does not guarantee future results investment return and principal value will fluctuate and fund shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost recent performance may be less than the figures shown obtain total returns current to the most recent monthend by calling our securities response center at  these figures do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares performance analysis what factors helped and hindered performance during the reporting period companies in the state farm growth fund from the oil and gas and mining and metals industries performed relatively well the fund’s overall largest holding exxonmobil  of net assets was also one of the biggest contributors to the fund’s return gaining over  for the reporting period some of the other large holdings in the oil and gas industry that were positive contributors for the fund include chevron  of net assets up  bg group  of net assets up  and bill barrett corp  of net assets up  in total exposure to the oil and gas industry was  of fund net assets up from  at december   within mining and metals rio tinto  of net assets was the best performing stock in the fund’s portfolio with a price increase of over  during the year the united kingdom based mining and minerals company completed the acquisition of the canada based aluminum manufacturer alcan in addition bhp billiton  of net assets performed well with a price increase of over  both companies continued to benefit from cyclical increases in demand for their products also contributing to the fund’s positive results were several holdings in computers electronicelectrical manufacturing chemicals and consumer  marketing industries within the computers and electronicelectrical manufacturing industries hewlettpackard  of net assets and intel corp  of net assets posted gains of  and  respectively among the chemicals holdings sigmaaldrich  of net assets experienced a price gain of  while air products  chemicals  of net assets stock improved  in consumer  marketing the fund achieved a positive price gain in procter  gamble  of net assets of  additionally nokia corp  of net assets and cocacola  of net assets posted gains of  and  respectively      the sp ® index is a capitalizationweighted measure of the common stocks of  large us companies        the sp ® index represents an unmanaged group of stocks that differs from the composition of the growth fund unlike an investment in the growth fund a theoretical investment in the index does not reflect any expenses it is not possible to invest directly in an index      other stocks represented in the top ten holdings of the fund that had positive returns during the year include johnson  johnson  of net assets general electric  of net assets archerdanielsmidland co  of net assets and microsoft  of net assets which posted price gains of    and  respectively several companies within the banks  of net assets and financial services  of net assets industries experienced stock price declines which detracted from fund performance during the year citigroup was among the fund’s largest detractors with a price decline of over  before being completely sold from the fund citigroup reported asset write downs related to subprime mortgages also wells fargo  co  of net assets bank of america  of net assets wachovia corp  of net assets and popular inc  of net assets declined    and  respectively another detractor from returns was hni corp  of net assets which declined  during the period hni corp was negatively impacted by a decline in sales at its fireplace products division caused by the us housing market weakness the state farm growth fund’s portfolio turnover over the past  months was  which is consistent with the fund’s investment philosophy and approach the majority of the turnover was due to the fund’s sale of biomet inc which was acquired by a private equity group for cash during the year biomet was a top holding of the growth fund prior to the sale there were  holdings in the fund totaling over  billion in assets at the end of the report period compared to  holdings and approximately  billion in assets oneyear earlier as highlighted in the fund’s investment objective – we feel that a company’s dividend policy is an important component in the analysis and selection of securities for the state farm growth fund from january   through november    of the stocks in the portfolio accounting for over  of the fund’s net assets increased their dividends given the performance analysis above what factors should shareholders take into consideration when reviewing the fund’s performance we are longterm investors who spend a lot of time getting to know companies and the people who run them we seek to understand the company’s long term strategies as well as the competitive advantages and risks inherent in them when we invest in a company it is normally our intention to maintain that investment for a very long period of time our investment strategy generally is not influenced by short term factors our philosophy sometimes will result in periods when the fund’s performance trails that of the market we define risk as the permanent loss of investment capital we believe this philosophy has produced competitive returns versus the benchmark over a long period of time    state farm balanced fund management’s discussion of fund performance   overview describe the fund’s investment objective and philosophy the state farm balanced fund is invested in a combination of stocks and bonds in the pursuit of longterm growth of principal with an element of current income historically the portfolio has maintained an asset allocation profile of approximately  equity and  fixed income the equity allocation is managed with a conservative bias that favors large capitalization companies that we believe are well managed with a niche or business specialty the fixed income component invests in high quality us government and corporate bonds primarily of intermediate maturity with the goal of providing shareowners with current income in addition to some protection from equity market volatility we tend to maintain a long term buyandhold philosophy with both the stock and bond investments of the fund describe the relevant market environment as it related to the fund for the reporting period the market environment was influenced by numerous factors including rising commodity prices a weakening us dollar relative to other major currencies a continued slow down in the housing market rising concerns of defaults on subprime mortgages and the federal reserve’s decision to lower the federal funds rate rising oil prices continued to be a factor throughout the year oil prices began the period at approximately barrel and touched highs of over barrel in midnovember before slipping to below barrel by the end of november  albeit still up over  for the month period the us dollar fell against the nation euro during the period amid concerns over the health of the us economy stoked by the subprime credit crisis for the period december  through november  the us dollar fell approximately  to euro versus the british pound the us dollar fell over  during the period to £ with the rising concerns of defaults on us subprime mortgages and the general tightening of credit the federal reserve responded to market conditions with two rate cuts during the latter months of  at the september  federal open market committee fomc meeting the fed cut the federal funds rate by  from  to  citing its intention to forestall adverse effects from the financial markets disruptions caused by the housing correction in late october the fed again reduced the federal funds rate this time by  to  as of november   the federal funds rate of  is down  from december  bond markets as represented by the year us treasury bond yield advanced during the month period ended november   as the uncertainty surrounding subprime mortgage issues and the resulting credit tightening helped spur a flight to quality driving prices on us treasuries higher and rates lower the yield on year us treasuries rose from  on december   to a peak of  on june   before declining

detractor from returns was pfizer  of total net assets which declined  during the period turnover in the equity portion of the state farm balanced fund’s portfolio over the past  months was  which is consistent with the fund’s investment philosophy and approach the majority of the turnover was due to the fund’s sale of biomet inc which was acquired by a private equity group for cash during the year biomet was a top equity holding of the state farm balanced fund prior to the sale there were  holdings in the equity portion of the state farm balanced fund totaling over  million in assets at the end of the report period compared to  holdings and approximately  million in assets oneyear earlier as highlighted in the fund’s investment objective we feel a company’s dividend policy is an important component in the analysis and selection of stocks for the portfolio from january   through november    of the stocks in the portfolio accounting for over  of the equity portion of the fund’s net assets increased their dividends fixed income portion of the fund approximately  of net assets throughout the period an intermediate maturity structure continues to be the investment orientation with  of the fixed income securities representing  of total net assets maturing  years out these securities were pretty evenly split between us treasury securities  of total net assets and corporate

however while the fund’s fixedincome investment orientation towards intermediatematurity bonds provided positive total returns during the period longermaturity bonds performed relatively better over the entire month period ended november  in addition higher quality bonds outperformed relative to lower quality bonds especially during the latter half of the year that being said the fund’s fixedincome investment orientation of investing in intermediateterm higher quality bonds helped to provide more stability and better serve as a buffer to the volatility from the equity portion of the

statistical calculation that measures a bond’s or in this case a bond portfolio’s price sensitivity relative to general movements in interest rates the slightly higher duration provided a modest positive effect to performance as interest rates declined in the intermediate part of the yield curve towards the end of the reporting period given the performance analysis above what factors should shareholders take into consideration when reviewing the fund’s performance the fund is designed and managed as a balanced fund that blends both stocks and bonds together in one convenient investment

interim fund is managed in a fashion that seeks to achieve over a period of years the highest yield possible that is consistent with low price volatility when managing the fund we are generally buyandhold investors who focus primarily on us government obligations general investment practice within the fund is to maintain a portfolio with approximately equal amounts maturing over the next six years while the fund may invest in debt securities of varying maturities it is structured with a maturity and interest rate risk duration profile that is consistent with its benchmark the lehman brothers  year us treasury index describe the relevant market environment as it related to the fund for the reporting period from december  through the middle of june  yields on us treasuries moved modestly higher as the federal reserve maintained a neutral stance on interest rate policy and left the fed funds rate unchanged at  however during the summer months of  both the equities and bond markets became increasingly more volatile investors were confronted with numerous economic events including a continuing weakness in the housing market higher energy prices and tightening credit as rising defaults on us subprime mortgages prompted lenders to implement more restricted lending requirements in the wake of these events and increasing concerns of a potential “credit crunch” the

overview describe the fund’s investment objective and philosophy the state farm municipal bond fund seeks as high a rate of income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with prudent investment management income may be subject to state and local taxes and if applicable the alternative minimum tax amt in managing the fund we focus on high credit quality bonds with an investment philosophy that seeks to provide competitive total returns while managing for tax efficiency within the municipal bond asset class over the long run the municipal bond market while relatively small in total assets compared to the taxable market is very broad by number of issuers as a result we believe that fundamental research and professional management is critical to success while we diversify the maturity spectrum of the bonds within the portfolio we tend to favor the intermediate maturity range for the bulk of the fund’s assets in doing so we seek to maintain a fairly consistent duration and interest rate exposure relative to the fund’s benchmark – the lehman brothers municipal bond index describe the relevant market environment as it related to the fund for the reporting period from december  through june  municipal bond yields across the maturity spectrum rose while bonds posted modest total returns however during the summer months of  both the equities and bond markets became increasingly more volatile investors were confronted with numerous economic events including a continuing weakness in the housing market higher energy prices and tightening credit as rising defaults on us subprime mortgages prompted lenders to implement more restricted lending requirements in the wake of these events and increasing concerns of a potential “credit crunch” the federal reserve

is where the rate ended as of november   as always it is unknown what future actions the fed may take regarding interest rates due primarily to the changes in the municipal bond market yield curve short maturity bonds outperformed intermediate maturities which in turn outperformed long maturity bonds over the year reporting period from a credit standpoint higher credit quality bonds outperformed low quality bonds over the reporting period overall at current interest rate levels year aaarated municipal bonds provide  of the yield available from taxable year us treasuries this comparison may be used as a general gauge within the industry to determine the relative attractiveness of municipal securities thus municipal bonds have recently offered yields close to those of

a theoretical investment in the index does not reflect any expenses it is not possible to invest directly in an index      performance analysis what factors helped and hindered performance during the reporting period as short and intermediate interest rates were declining more substantially than longerterm interest rates during the last five months of the reporting period the fund’s short and intermediate maturity orientation was a benefit with  of total investments in bonds maturing within  years versus  for the benchmark as of november   in addition the fund ended november  with  of total investments in bonds maturing between  years with no bonds in the portfolio having maturities over  years as a result the fund was positioned to benefit from a decline in interest rates especially during a period when yields on short and intermediate bond maturities declined more than long maturities the modified duration of the state farm municipal bond fund at the end of november  stood at  years which is up from  years on december   modified duration is a statistical calculation that measures a bond’s or in this case a bond fund’s price sensitivity relative to general movements in interest rates the slightly higher duration also contributed somewhat to the positive effect to performance associated with declining interest rates the fund also maintained a high quality credit orientation throughout the reporting period and ended november  with over  of total investments in municipal bonds rated aa or higher by moody’s investor services over the reporting period higher quality municipal credits outperformed low quality credits combined the difference in maturity structure between the fund and benchmark along with the fund’s higher credit quality orientation than the benchmark played a role in the fund’s relative outperformance versus the benchmark during the reporting period as highlighted earlier the objective of the fund is to seek as high a rate of income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with prudent investment management the fund has been invested with a bias towards highcredit quality short and intermediate maturity

notable changes to the portfolio included increased purchases of general obligation bonds in kansas and california however the majority of the changes to the portfolio were the result of the normal

competitive total returns relative to the municipal bond asset class while managing for tax efficiency      expense example unaudited   as a shareholder of a fund you incur ongoing costs including management fees and other fund expenses the example in the following table is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in a fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period june   through november   actual expenses the first line under each fund name in the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this line together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value for a fund by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” for the applicable fund to estimate the expenses you paid on your account for that fund during this period if your account has multiple fund positions add up the results calculated for each fund position within your account to estimate the expenses you paid on your total account value a potential  low balance fee is not included in the expenses shown in the table this fee may be charged to an account other than a sep ira simple ira or an account held under other employersponsored qualified retirement plans if the balance of the account falls below  at the close of business on the first business day in november unless the account was opened on or after january  within the same year you should consider any low balance fee you incurred when estimating the total ongoing expenses paid over the period and the impact of this fee on your ending account value this additional fee has the effect of reducing investment returns hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line under each fund name in the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the fund’s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the fund’s actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds a potential  low balance fee is not included in the expenses shown in the table this fee may be charged to an account other than a sep ira simple ira or an account held under other employersponsored qualified retirement plans if the balance of the account falls below  at the close of business on the first business day in november unless the account was opened on or after january  within the same year you should consider any low balance fee that you incurred when estimating the total ongoing expenses paid over the period and the impact of this fee on your ending account value this additional fee has the effect of reducing investment returns please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only therefore the second line under each fund name in the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds including those that have transactional costs such as sales charges loads redemptions fees or exchange fees

“board” of state farm associates’ funds trust “associates’ funds trust” held on june   all of the trustees present including those trustees present who were not interested persons of associates’ funds trust as defined by section a of the investment company act of  the “independent trustees” considered whether to approve the continuation of the investment advisory and management services agreement between state farm investment management corp “sfimc” and associates’ funds trust the “advisory agreement” including an amendment to such agreement to provide that the associates’ funds trust will pay investment management and advisory fees to sfimc on a monthly rather than quarterly basis in considering whether to approve the continuation of the advisory agreement the independent trustees were assisted in their review by independent legal counsel who prior to the june   meeting sent to sfimc a request for information to be provided to the board in connection with the board’s consideration of continuing the advisory agreement sfimc provided materials to the board responding to that request prior to the meeting including a fundbyfund profitability analysis on each series of the associates’ funds trust each a “fund” and collectively the “funds” sfimc also provided the board with additional information that sfimc believed would be useful to the board in evaluating whether to approve continuation of the advisory agreement the board also received a report prepared by morningstar inc an independent fund tracking organization the “morningstar report” relating to the performance and expenses of each of the funds prior to the june th meeting in addition the board received and reviewed a memorandum from the legal counsel to associates’ funds trust and its independent trustees regarding their responsibilities particularly the independent trustees’ responsibilities in considering whether to approve continuation of the advisory agreement the independent trustees conducted a preliminary review of all this material on may   at a separate meeting during which management of associates’ funds trust expanded on those materials responded to specific questions from the independent trustees and then produced enhanced materials to the board at the june th meeting in response to additional specific requests as part of the board’s consideration of whether to approve the continuation of the advisory agreement the independent trustees met outside the presence of sfimc management and were advised by their independent legal counsel investment performance the board considered the performance of each fund among other things the board examined the yeartodate one three five and tenyear performance of each fund as compared to the performance of one or more benchmark indexes and a peer group of funds with comparable investment objectives investment strategies asset size and noload structures “peer funds” regarding the performance of the state farm interim fund and the fixed income portion of the state farm balanced fund the board noted that they had been advised that the management of those portfolios has been effected in a conservative fashion and therefore relative performance has lagged over the three and fiveyear periods ended march   the board further considered the information contained in the morningstar report relating to the overall performance of the funds including against each fund’s benchmark andor index and with the performance of the fund’s peer funds after extensive discussion of this and other performance information the board concluded that the investment performance of the funds over the periods reviewed was acceptable fees and expenses the board examined the fee structure and expense ratio of each fund including in comparison to peer funds the board also considered sfimc’s profitability in serving as investment adviser to associates’ funds trust noting that sfimc earned a modest profit per fund in managing the associates’ funds trust the board considered the effect if any on shareholders that would result from the proposal to change the fee payment schedule to a monthly basis based upon these factors the board concluded that each fund’s advisory fee including pursuant to the proposed revised payment schedule was reasonable and appropriate for the shareholders of each fund nature extent and quality of services the board considered the nature extent and quality of the advisory services provided by sfimc to the funds the board considered the makeup education and experience of the sfimc teams responsible for managing the funds and concluded that sfimc’s investment management teams have a satisfactory longterm track record in managing the funds after considering this information the board concluded that sfimc had more than sufficient resources and expertise to continue to manage the funds and that given its past experience sfimc would be able to continue to provide satisfactory services to associates’ funds trust the board next discussed whether sfimc derives any other direct or indirect benefits from serving as investment adviser to the funds sfimc discussed the various ancillary services that it provides the funds including serving as transfer agent and its      affiliate state farm vp management corp serving as the funds’ underwriter sfimc explained to the board that neither sfimc nor state farm vp management corp receives fees from associates’ funds trust for providing those services sfimc indicated to the board that it was not aware of any other ancillary or other benefits that sfimc and its affiliates receive from associates’ funds trust particularly because sfimc does not execute securities trades on behalf of the funds through an affiliated brokerdealer the board concluded that the lack of any material ancillary or socalled “fallout” benefits enables sfimc to manage assets of the funds in a manner that appears to be free of conflicts of interest the board next discussed the extent to which economies of scale will be realized as each fund grows and whether each fund’s fee levels reflect economies of scale for the benefit of the fund sfimc explained to the board that economies of scale occur when a mutual fund’s expenses per unit such as per dollar invested in the fund decreases as the fund increases in size one way a mutual fund company achieves economies of scale is to lower the average cost per unit by spreading fixed costs over a larger asset base sfimc advised the board that as the funds grow each fund’s fixed costs will be spread over a larger asset base so a fund’s fee levels will reflect economies of scale for the benefit of the fund as the fund grows the board also noted that the advisory agreement includes breakpoints which lead to economics of scale for fund shareholders as assets increase based on the trustees’ deliberations and their evaluation of the information provided by sfimc the board including all of the independent trustees present at the board meeting unanimously approved the continuation of the advisory agreement for all funds through june              this page intentionally

statements    state farm associates’ funds trust notes to financial statements    investment objective the state farm associates’ funds trust the “trust” has four separate investment portfolios each a “fund” and together the “funds” each fund has its own investment objective investment policies restrictions and attendant risks the state farm growth fund the “growth fund” seeks longterm growth of capital which may be supplemented by income the growth fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing at least  of its assets in common stocks and other income producing equity securities the state farm balanced fund the “balanced fund” seeks longterm growth of principal while providing some current income the balanced fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing approximately  of its assets in common stocks and ordinarily limits its common stock investments to no more than  of total assets the balanced fund ordinarily invests at least  of its total assets in fixed income securities the balanced fund invests in fixed income securities to provide relative stability of principal and income the state farm interim fund the “interim fund” seeks the realization over a period of years of the highest yield consistent with relatively low price volatility the interim fund seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in high quality debt securities with short and intermediateterm maturities the state farm municipal bond fund the “municipal bond fund” seeks as high a rate of income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with prudent investment management the municipal bond fund seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment primarily in a diversified selection of municipal bonds with maturities of one to seventeen years the municipal bond fund normally invests so that either  at least  of the fund’s net investment income is exempt from regular federal income tax or  at least  of the fund’s net assets are invested in securities that produce income exempt from regular federal income tax    significant accounting policies the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” securities valuation investments are stated at market value stocks traded on securities exchanges or in the overthecounter market in which transaction prices are reported are valued at the last sales prices on the day of valuation or if there are no reported sales on that day at the last reported bid price for the day stocks traded on the nasdaq stock market are valued at the nasdaq official closing price longterm debt securities and us treasury bills are generally valued using quotations provided by an independent pricing service shortterm debt securities with remaining maturities of  days or less other than us treasury bills are generally valued on an amortized cost basis which approximates market value short sales are valued at market value portfolio securities that are primarily traded on foreign securities exchanges “foreign securities” are generally valued at the closing values of such securities on the respective exchange where each security is primarily traded in the event that state farm investment management corp “sfimc” the trust’s investment adviser determines that a market quotation for a foreign security held by a fund is not reliable because of events or circumstances that have occurred between the time of the market quotation and the time as of which the security is to be fair valued “subsequent event” the security is valued at fair value in accordance with procedures established by the trust’s board of trustees a subsequent event might include companyspecific developments a development that might affect an entire market or region a potentially global development or a significant change in one or more us securities indexes if a security is valued at “fair value” that value may be different from the last quoted market price securities not valued as described above and securities for which market prices are not readily available or are considered unreliable are fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the trust’s board of trustees fair value as a general principle means the value a fund might reasonably expect to receive upon sale of that security these fair value procedures require sfimc to obtain bid price quotations from brokers or dealers in the securities if sfimc cannot obtain a quotation for the security or if sfimc believes the quotation does not represent the security’s fair value then sfimc will determine the security’s fair value in its reasonable judgment in making a fair value judgment sfimc may use different methodologies including multiple of earnings multiple of book value discount from market of a similar freely traded security or for debt securities yield to maturity other factors sfimc may consider in determining fair value for a security include but are not limited to fundamental analytical data relating to the security the nature and duration of any restrictions on disposition of the security the last traded price of the security significant global or regional events such as political unrest natural disasters and war and significant movements in major market indices exchange traded funds index futures or other financial instruments in the us or other markets    state farm associates’ funds trust notes to financial statements continued   securities transactions and investment income for financial reporting purposes security transactions are accounted for on trade date date the order to buy or sell is executed and dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization of premiums and discounts on fixed income securities realized gains and losses from security transactions are reported on an identified cost basis securities purchased on a “whenissued” basis the municipal bond fund may purchase municipal bonds on a “whenissued” basis delivery and payment for these securities may be a month or more after the purchase date during which time such securities are subject to market fluctuations the municipal bond fund identifies and holds specific liquid assets with a market value at least equal to the amount of the whenissued purchase commitments in order to ensure that it can meet those commitments it is possible that the securities will never be issued and the commitment cancelled at november   the municipal bond fund had commitments of  representing  of net assets for whenissued securities fund share valuation fund shares are sold and redeemed on a continuous basis at net asset value the net asset value per share is determined daily on each day the new york stock exchange is open except that a fund need not compute a net asset value on any day when no purchase or redemption order has been received by the fund the net asset values are determined as of the close of regular session trading on the new york stock exchange usually  pm central time the net asset value per share is computed by dividing the total value of a fund’s investments and other assets less liabilities by the number of fund shares outstanding federal income taxes dividends and distributions to shareholders it is the funds’ policy to comply with the special provisions of subchapter m of the internal revenue code applicable to regulated investment companies and in the manner provided therein to distribute substantially all of their taxable income including any net realized gain on sales of investments reportable for federal income tax purposes the funds intend to comply with this policy and accordingly no provision for federal income taxes has been made as of november   aggregate securities holdings’ unrealized gains and losses based on cost for federal income tax purposes for the funds were as follows   fund    cost of investments forfederal tax purposes    gross unrealized appreciation    gross unrealized depreciation     net unrealized

the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes and the cost of investments reflected on the schedules of investments are primarily related to the timing of recognition of gains and losses and investment income the interim fund and municipal bond fund declare dividends daily equal to each fund’s respective net investment income prior to april   these amounts were distributed at the end of each calendar quarter beginning april   these amounts are distributed on the last business day of each month net realized gains on sales of investments if any are distributed annually after the close

regulations which may differ from gaap these differences may be primarily due to differing treatment for futures contracts the recognition of net realized losses the timing of fund distributions expiring capital loss carryovers and foreign currency transactions as a result net investment income and net realized gain or loss on investment transactions for a reporting period may differ from distributions during such period accordingly each fund may periodically make reclassifications among certain capital accounts without impacting its net asset value as of november   these

fasb issued fasb interpretation no  “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin  fin  provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized measured presented and disclosed in the financial statements fin  requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the funds’ tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “morelikelythannot” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority tax positions not deemed to meet the morelikelythannot threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year adoption of fin  is required for fiscal years beginning after december   and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the effective date the trust’s management has completed a review of fin  and has determined that no tax liability is required and no additional disclosures are needed as of november   in addition in september  statement of financial accounting standards no  “fair value
