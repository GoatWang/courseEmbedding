from  see all buying options this is a thoroughly updated edition of dynamic asset pricing theory the standard text for doctoral students and researchers on the theory of asset pricing and portfolio selection in multiperiod settings under uncertainty the asset pricing results are based on the three increasingly restrictive assumptions absence of arbitrage singleagent optimality and equilibrium these results are unified with two key concepts state prices and martingales technicalities are given relatively little emphasis so as to draw connections between these concepts and to make plain the similarities between discrete and continuoustime models readers will be particularly intrigued by this latest editions most significant new feature a chapter on corporate securities that offers alternative approaches to the valuation of corporate debt also while much of the continuoustime portion of the theory is based on brownian motion this third edition introduces jumpsfor example those associated with poisson arrivalsin order to accommodate surprise events such as bond defaults applications include termstructure models derivative valuation and hedging methods numerical methods covered include monte carlo simulation and finitedifference solutions for partial differential equations each chapter provides extensive problem exercises and notes to the literature a system of appendixes reviews the necessary mathematical concepts and references have been updated throughout with this new edition dynamic asset pricing theory remains at the head of the field read more read

review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsdo not purchase the kindle version of this bookbyamazonrevieweron june  format hardcoverthe kindle version of this book is of extremely poor quality it looks like trashin  paying customers who fork over  usd for the electronic version of this book deserve more than a crappy htmlized version of the printed text where the equations do not scale properly or even line up with the baseline of surrounding textby flipping through the free sample provided above and comparing it with a copy of the print edition one can quickly assess just how badly the publisher has wrecked the typesetting of the formulas by converting the text from native pdf to their own proprietary kindle format only certain formats pdf being foremost among them can faithfully preserve all of the elegance and beauty that mathematical typesetting systems like latex provideby refusing to purchase the electronic version customers can send a strong message to the publisher that they will not accept an inferior product in order to accommodate their desire for digital rights managementthe kindle replica format is a potential solution to this problem as the latter is nothing more than a drmwrapped version of pdfquestion to the publisher why are you not offering a kindle replica version of this text because if you did i would purchase it immediatelyread more comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsa waste of timebya customeron june  format hardcoverthis book is at best useful as a reference book but even that is doubtfulif you are new to the subject you will find it very hard to follow concepts are often defined purely in math terms with intuition given very sparsely if at all proofs are very terse read incomplete because everything is easy to show and annoyingly often results are simply stated with the derivation left as an exercise leaving me wondering why duffie uses precious space for those pointless remarks instead of actually explaining the materialif on the other hand you already know the material the book might be useful as a reference due to its tersenes however i dont see why someone would bother to get used to new notation when they already know the material from somewhere elseas another reviewer already stated math requirements are quite high real analysis stochastic calculus and measure theory at least and here again i doubt that someone might find the appendices helpful if they dont know the material already from somewhere elsealso i agree with someone elses comment that while finance can be tough it is definitely not as tough as duffie makes it to be of course there is always a tradeoff between generality and presenting concepts in an easy way but just because something can be done with complex numbers does not mean that it has toread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsfinance for economistsbyjson april  format hardcoverthis book provides the most elegant and coherent synthesis of finance theory in a complete markets and frictionless settingsfor the reader interested in the theoretical foundations of modern financial models this book has three main advantages over many of its competitors it clearly shows the link between modern finance theory and the year old arrowdebreu model as this book will make clear financial assets can be viewed as bundles of arrowdebreu contingent goods and pricing kernels are simply extensions of arrowdebreu contingent state prices it bridges the gap between arbitrage models on one hand and models based on consumption optimizationdynamic programming and general equilibrium on the other hand absence of arbitrage guarantees the existence of a stochastic discount factor or pricing kernel optimality implies that the stochastic discount factor must be equal to the investors intertemporal marginal rate of substitution it provides a unified treatment of discretetime and continuoustime models many finance textbooks focus on the mathematic tools and emphasize the difference between continuoustime and discretetime toolsusually at the expense of the economics underlying both types of models in contrast duffies book emphasizes the conceptual unity between continuoustime and discretetime asset pricingthis book was written more for students and academics than for pratictioners it is not a reference or a recipe book for traders and programmers several chapters are devoted to generalequilibrium models that pratictioners are not likely to find useful however the essentials of derivative asset pricing and the term structure are also covered the latest edition even includes a chapter on corporate financefinally this book is pretty much selfcontained all the graduatelevel math results used in the proofs are presented either in the main body of the book or in appendicesread morecomment  people found this helpful was this

duffiedarrell  jan  tweet   facebook   linkedin   save this article send to   print this page   this is the first in a regular series of columns by darrell duffie the dean witter distinguished professor of finance at stanford universitys graduate school of business duffie is also professor by courtesy in the universitys economics department he has recently been an adviser on financial markets to a range of bodies including the financial stability board and several federal reserve banks big increases in the capital requirements of bankaffiliated dealers have drained liquidity from overthecounter markets especially for products that occupy a lot of space on dealer balance sheets such as bonds swaps repos and foreign exchange contracts dealers have reduced their marketmaking inventories and are offering less liquid twoway markets for asset classes whose capital requirements have increased significantly they have also deployed new financial engineering methods such as swap compression trading and central clearing that reduce the amount of balance sheet space required for a given amount of intermediation to further shrink their balance sheets dealers have been firing large numbers of less profitable primebrokerage clients in the corporate bond market dealers are now more likely to offer agency or riskless principal intermediation which delays the execution of a clients request to sell until the dealer can find a matching buyer again this reduces the amount of balance sheet space required to handle a given amount of trades some dealers have simply abandoned their less profitable marketmaking franchises how do we make sense of all this although there are many shifting factors at play the key underlying force is the significant postcrisis increase in basel iii regulatory capital requirements the benefits of a safer financial system easily dominate the corresponding cost in market liquidity but a better understanding of this cost could promote some improvements in practice and regulation riskweighted capital requirements are less distortionary and equally effective in promoting financial stability if set conservatively there has been a lot of confusion about whether or why capital requirements matter for market liquidity i have often been asked if capital requirements matter wouldnt that be a violation of the modiglianimiller mm theorem this famous result states that the total market value of a firms assets does not depend on the firms capital structure even under its own assumptions however mm does not speak to the incentives of a firm to add new positions to its balance sheet whenever a dealer adds a new position even at zero trading profit the market value of the dealers equity can be affected by a change in the riskiness of the balance sheet for instance adding a sufficiently risky position even before considering any trading profit can benefit a dealers shareholders at the expense of its creditors because the limited liability of shareholders allows them to walk away from insolvency at no cost this leaves creditors with a weaker claim economists call this asset substitution even if no single trade has a big impact the incremental effects can add up subtly over time capital requirements reduce or block assetsubstitution incentives and encourage a widening of bidoffer spreads higher capital requirements also alter an important incentive known as debt overhang as first explained by stewart myers in  debt overhang implies that a trade with a positive marktomarket dealer profit can sometimes imply a negative return for the dealers equity if the trade requires enough new capital it may improve the credit quality of the dealers debt and correspondingly reduce the equity market value associated with limited liability this is more likely to happen when the additional capital required for the new position is large relative to the riskiness of the position in effect this is like asset substitution in reverse for example under the us supplementary leverage ratio rule for the largest us brokerdealers every  million of additional assets requires an additional  million of capital regardless of the risk of the assets this means that intermediating very safe assets such as us treasury repos requires a lot of capital relative to the tiny risk involved and improves the position of creditors so as this capital requirement goes up repo dealers should increase their bidask spreads enough to overcome the debt overhang cost to their shareholders and that is exactly what they have been doing since the imposition of the supplementary leverage ratio rule bidask spreads in the us treasury repo market have increased from around  basis points to more than bp as a consequence volumes of trade in treasury repos have dropped precipitously especially in the interdealer repo market in general dealers best respond to increases in capital requirements by increasing bidask spreads for positions that require a lot of regulatory capital relative to their risk and using financial engineering or new intermediation methodologies to economise on the use of balance sheet space regulators should reconsider the effect of the leverage ratio rule on the efficiency of markets for very safe assets riskweighted capital requirements are less distortionary and equally effective in promoting financial

reviews  product description in this book two of america’s leading economists provide the first integrated treatment of the conceptual practical and empirical foundations for credit risk pricing and risk measurement masterfully applying theory to practice darrell duffie and kenneth singleton model credit risk for the purpose of measuring portfolio risk and pricing defaultable bonds credit derivatives and other securities exposed to credit risk the methodological rigor scope and sophistication of their stateoftheart account is unparalleled and its singularly indepth treatment of pricing and credit derivatives further illuminates a problem that has drawn much attention in an era when financial institutions the world over are revising their credit management strategies   duffie and singleton offer critical assessments of alternative approaches to creditrisk modeling while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current practice their approach blends indepth discussions of the conceptual foundations of modeling with extensive analyses of the empirical properties of such creditrelated time series as default probabilities recoveries ratings transitions and yield spreads both the “structura” and “reducedform” approaches to pricing defaultable securities are presented and their comparative fits to historical data are assessed the authors also provide a comprehensive treatment of the pricing of credit derivatives including credit swaps collateralized debt obligations credit guarantees lines of credit and spread options not least they describe certain enhancements to current pricing and management practices that they argue will better position financial institutions for future changes in the financial markets credit risk is an indispensable resource for risk
