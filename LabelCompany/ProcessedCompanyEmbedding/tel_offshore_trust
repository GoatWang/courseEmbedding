trustees including the corporate trustee have no authority over have not evaluated and make no statement concerning the internal control over financial reporting of any of the owner or owners of the royalty properties the working interest owners  basis of accounting and going concern         the accompanying unaudited financial information has been prepared by the corporate trustee the accompanying financial information is prepared on a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the trustees believe that the information furnished reflects all adjustments that are in the opinion of the trustees necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature the financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the trusts annual report on form k for the year ended december           overriding royalty interest     the trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting to report trust receipts from the overriding royalty and payments of expenses incurred actual cash distributions to the trust were made based on the terms of the conveyance that created the trusts overriding royalty interest prior to the royalty sales as defined in note  the overriding royalty interest entitled the trust to receive revenues oil gas and natural gas liquid sales less expenses the amount by which all royalties lease operating expenses including well workover costs production and property taxes postproduction costs including plugging and abandonment and producing overhead of the underlying properties multiplied by the partnerships interest in the original royalty the original royalty initially represented a  net profits interest but after the royalty sales the partnership no longer owns any overriding interest in the royalty properties  tel offshore trust notes to condensed financial statements unaudited continued  basis of accounting and going concern continued         modified cash basis of accounting     the condensed financial statements of the trust as prepared on a modified cash basis reflect the trusts assets liabilities trust corpus earnings and distributions as follows a royalty income from the overriding royalty interest was recorded when received including the effect of overtaken or undertaken positions and negative or positive adjustments by the corporate trustee on the last business day of each calendar quarter in addition royalty income included amounts related to funds deposited or released from the special cost escrow accountsee d b trust general and administrative expenses which include the trustees fees as well as accounting engineering legal and other professional fees and expenses related to the probate proceeding are recorded when paid by the trust rather than when incurred c cash reserves for trust expenses may be established by the trustee for certain expenditures that would not be recorded as contingent liabilities under gaap d the funds deposited or released from the special cost escrow account were recorded at the time of payment or receipt the special cost escrow account is an account of the working interest owners and is not reflected in the condensed financial statements of the trust e amortization of the investment in overriding royalty interest was calculated based on the unitsofproduction method such amortization is charged directly to trust corpus and does not affect distributable income and f proceeds from loans and cash advances used to pay for trust expenses is charged directly to trust corpus         this manner of reporting income and expenses is considered to be the most meaningful because the quarterly distributions to unit holders are based on net cash receipts received from the working interest owners the condensed financial statements of the trust differ from condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap because under such principles royalty income and trust general and administrative expenses for a quarter would be recognized on an accrual basis in addition amortization of the net overriding royalty interest calculated on a unitsofproduction basis was charged directly to trust corpus since such amount did not affect distributable income this comprehensive basis of accounting other than gaap corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the us securities and exchange commission as specified by staff accounting bulletin topic e financial statements of royalty trusts          oil and gas reserves     the proved oil and gas reserves for the underlying properties were previously estimated by independent petroleum engineers reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof estimates by different engineers often vary sometimes significantly in addition physical factors such as the results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate as well as economic factors  tel offshore trust notes to condensed financial statements unaudited continued  basis of accounting and going concern continued such as changes in product prices and production costs may justify revision of such estimates accordingly oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from estimates         the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was prepared using assumptions made pursuant to fasb and sec guidelines such assumptions include using average fiscalyear oil and gas prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the month reporting period and yearend costs for estimated future production expenditures discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a  discount rate changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure the standardized measure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the current fair market value of proved reserves         amortization of overriding royalty interest     the trust amortized the investment in overriding royalty interest using the unitsofproduction method the trusts rate of recording amortization was dependent upon the estimates of total proved reserves which incorporated various assumptions and future projections if the estimates of total proved reserves declined significantly the rate at which the trust recorded amortization expense would have increased reducing trust corpus such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices which may make it uneconomic to produce from higher cost fields as a result of the  royalty sale the trust no longer holds any investment in the overriding royalty interest and there will be no further amortization         impairment of investment in overriding royalty interest     the trust reviewed overriding royalty interests in oil and gas properties for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicated the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if there was an indication of impairment the trust prepared an estimate of future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if these cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss was recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and was based on the corporate trustees best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions as a result of the  royalty sale the trust no longer holds any investment in the overriding royalty interest and there will be no further impairments         cash and cash equivalents     cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of three months or less         restricted cash     restricted cash reported on the condensed statement of assets liabilities and trust corpus consists of i  proceeds received by the trust from the  royalty sale and ii the distribution received by the trust as a result of the

have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
