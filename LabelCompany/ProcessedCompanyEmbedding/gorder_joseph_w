securities laws therere many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those weve described in our filings with the sec now ill turn the call over to joe for a few opening remarks joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer well thanks john and good morning everyone in the second quarter we continue to face a challenging margin environment which was further complicated by high compliance cost headwinds but our team performed well running safely and reliably while maintaining our costefficient operations turning to the markets sweet crude discounts in the second quarter remained narrow as shale crude production continued to slow unplanned crude production outages caused by wildfires in canada led to the tightening of medium and heavy sour crude discounts relative to brent more recently with the resumption of crude production in canada and the continued flow of foreign medium sour crudes to the us gulf coast weve seen discounts widening versus brent we expect medium heavy and sour crude oils to remain attractive on the products side margins improved compared to the first quarter and product demand in domestic and export markets remain robust in fact we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline combined for the second quarter turning to our refining growth strategy we successfully commissioned the new houston crude unit in june in addition the corpus christi crude unit which was completed late last year ran well at above planned rates we continued engineering and procurement work on the  million houston alkylation unit which we expect to complete in the first half of  we also continued to develop other strategic projects that will provide octane enhancement feedstock flexibility and cogeneration to create higher value products and reduce cost also in june we acquired the remaining  interest in the parkway pipeline which connects our st charles refinery to the plantation pipeline with  ownership interest in this pipeline and the planned connection to the colonial pipeline weve enhanced our product supply options to the us east coast this transaction fits our strategy to optimize through investments in logistics assets which we expect to be eligible for future drop to valero energy partners lp our sponsored mlp with respect to vlp last week we announced the distribution increase of  for the second quarter which keeps us on pace for an annual distribution growth rate of  and finally despite the lower margin environment we generated solid cash flow from operations and stepped up our return of cash to stockholders through our buyback program so with that john ill hand it back over to you john locke  vice president–investor relations thank you joe for the quarter net income attributable to valero stockholders was  million or  per share which compares to  billion or  per share in the second quarter of  excluding an aftertax lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit of  million or  per share and an asset impairment loss of  million or  per share second quarter  adjusted net income was  million or  per share please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on page three of the financial tables that accompany our release operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of  was  billion and adjusted operating income was  million which was  billion lower than the second quarter of  primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to lingering high product inventories and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to brent crude oil higher rin prices also created additional earnings headwinds in the second quarter of  refining throughput volumes averaged  million barrels per day in the second quarter of  which was in line with the second quarter of  our refineries operated at  throughput capacity utilization which was impacted by a turnaround at our texas city refinery refining cash operating expenses of  per barrel in the second quarter of  were  per barrel lower compared to the second quarter of  largely driven by lower energy costs the ethanol segment generated  million of operating income in the second quarter of  and adjusted operating income of  million which was  million lower than in the second quarter of  due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon driven by higher corn prices in the second quarter of  additionally for the second quarter of  general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were  million and net interest expense was  million depreciation and amortization expense was  million and the effective tax rate was  in the second quarter of  the effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than in the second quarter of  primarily due to the positive change in the companys lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve in the second quarter of  which contributed to a stronger relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates with respect to our balance sheet at quarter end total debt was  billion and cash and temporary cash investments were  billion of which  million was held by vlp valeros debt to capitalization ratio net of  billion in cash was  we had  billion of available liquidity excluding cash of which  million was only available to vlp we generated  billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter of which  billion was due to favorable working capital changes primarily increases in accounts and taxes payable and a reduction in inventories with regard to investing activities we made  million of capital investments of which  million was for turnarounds and catalyst this amount excludes our purchase of the remaining  interest in the parkway pipeline from kinder morgan moving to financing activities we returned  million in cash to stockholders in the second quarter which included  million in dividend payments and  million for the purchase of over  million shares of valero common stock as of june  we had approximately  million of share repurchase authorization remaining for  we expect to invest  billion to maintain the business and another  billion for refining asset optimization and logistics projects which are expected to drive longterm earnings growth for modeling our third quarter operations we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges us gulf coast at  million barrels per day to  million barrels per day us midcontinent at  barrels per day to  barrels per day us west coast at  barrels per day to  barrels per day and the north atlantic at  barrels per day to  barrels per day the guidance range for the us gulf coast reflects the previously announced major turnaround at the port arthur refinery which occurs once every five years refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately  per barrel in the third quarter we continue to expect costs related to meeting our biofuel blending obligations primarily related to rins in the us to be between  million and  million for  costs will likely end up in the upper end of that range based on recent rin prices the ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of  million gallons per day operating expenses should average  per gallon which includes  per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization ga expenses for the third quarter excluding corporate depreciation are expected to be around  million and net interest expense should be about  million total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately  million and our effective tax rate should be around  that concludes our opening remarks before we open the call to questions we ask that callers adhere to our protocol in the qa to two questions this will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their question if you have more than two questions please rejoin the queue as time permits questionandanswer session operator and thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and we have our first question from neil mehta with goldman sachs neil mehta  goldman sachs  co good morning guys congrats on the strong cash flow quarter here want to kick it off on the product side clearly product margins are a concern for investors as we think about both the refining stocks and then also as we think about the flat price per crude so two questions on that basis one joe do you think theres just too much refining capacity in the world here is there a structural oversupply in capacity and then do you expect that were going to see run cuts this fall here in the us or elsewhere in the world joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer morning neil and thanks for your comments why dont i let gary take a crack at this gary k simmons  senior vice presidentsupply international operations and systems optimization yeah neil i think despite the fact that weve seen very strong product demand obviously the refinery utilization has been such that supply has been able to keep up and even outpace demand so ultimately were going to need a rebalancing and see lower refinery utilization moving forward so i do believe that youll see some refinery run cuts as we head into the third quarter and fourth quarter i think that some of what happened this year is that with the steep contango in the market especially early in the year some marginal refining capacity that typically you would see cut in the winter had incentive to go ahead and run and produce the summer grade of gasoline and so it caused utilization to be very high especially like in the january february timeframe and thats where we built the large overhang of products that weve really had to manage the rest of this year neil mehta  goldman sachs  co i appreciate those comments and then secondly on rins here you maintained the guidance of  million to  million but is it fair to say theres some upward bias to the midpoint of the range joe can you just talk about what you ultimately see as the resolution to this rins issue i know its something that youve been talking to the epa about quite a lot and then just how you see the rins issue evolving from here joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer okay neil thats a good question and ill speak just briefly about the lawsuit really and then if we have procedural questions jay can help me with that but our action with the epa is really focused on dealing with the current structure of the system the current system as you know misaligns the rin obligation with the ability to comply by blending so whats happened its enabled speculators to drive up rin prices which really distorts the markets and it facilitates opportunities for rin fraud which weve seen a fair amount of moving to point of obligation really would address these issues and then it would enable the penetration of biofuel products into the marketplace to increase their blending so thats really the emphasis for us on trying to push this just to try to fix a structure that we think really is misaligned and infeasible today and then jay on process any comments jay d browning  executive vice president  general counsel yeah as everyone knows if youre engaged in litigation were only in a position to control our own efforts and timing and we are doing everything possible that we can to bring attention to the issue we have filed the lawsuits we filed the petition for reconsideration and weve engaged in a lot of effort to educate other affected parties as well as epa officials ideally we would like to see epa of its own accord engage in a rulemaking process and if they were to do so you can go to the epa website and see basically how long it takes for them to put out a proposed rule gather comments and finalize a rule short of that were having to fall back on timing of the process of litigation which is very difficult to speculate neil mehta  goldman sachs  co all right guys thanks for the comments joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks neil operator and thank you our next question comes from evan calio with morgan stanley evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc hey good morning guys joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning evan evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc hey i know you guys raised your dividend early in the first quarter and your indicative yield today is higher than it was in  and  can you discuss how you stress the dividend when you establish or decide to raise that earlier this year and how you view the sustainability of your yield michael s ciskowski  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay evan our dividend is a commitment to our shareholders and we do consider it nondiscretionary with our cash position and nearly  billion of liquidity we have available to us were quite comfortable with the sustainability of our current dividend and also the payout target of at least  of net income and in addition were not concerned with the funding of our capital program joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer and evan we did take a good hard look at this and obviously margins can be volatile right thats a understatement for the year last year they were strong this year theyre weaker and so we ran cases before we presented to the board the dividend increase which really looked at different margin scenarios and thats how we got our comfort level with it i mean we stressed it pretty hard and obviously in this lowmargin environment and with earnings where they are were still in a good position on the dividend so obviously we did a thorough job on that evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc yeah no that makes sense and that should help support in this environment your stock maybe a followup on the distribution comment i mean youre running above the  payout target yeartodate in q how should we think about that target going forward and does the higher distribution reflect your view on an improving outlook or the cash generating abilities of your assets michael s ciskowski  chief financial officer  executive vice president our target is based on net income but we do understand in this lower earnings environment that we have to consider our cash flow generating capabilities and then also the drops to the vlp so through june we have paid out  of adjusted net income and thats about  of our cash flow evan calio  morgan stanley  co llc got it appreciate it guys john locke  vice president–investor relations good thanks evan operator and thank you our next question comes from paul cheng with barclays paul cheng  barclays capital inc hey guys good morning john locke  vice president–investor relations good morning paul paul cheng  barclays capital inc couple question mike do you have any preliminary   capex that you can share and if the margins stay close to where we are over the next one or two years then how quickly you can adjust those number michael s ciskowski  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay paul we havent disclosed our  capital budget yet but notionally were going to be spending  billion to  billion on maintenance capital and roughly  billion on growth obviously theres more flexibility in the growth category but the projects that were identifying are attractive and youd want us to complete these at those rates at those hurdle rate so today we have lots of cash like i just mentioned and a lot of liquidity and were quite comfortable in funding our capital expenditures at those levels paul cheng  barclays capital inc joe just curious then with the refining market i think weaker than people expected when youre looking at the ma market have you seen any change in the  in the last several months joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer paul i would tell you i dont think weve seen any major change i mean obviously in a down market if seller doesnt want to sell for what the valuations might be and a buyer doesnt want to pay for assets based on what weve experienced in the past and so its always a negotiation when youre looking at it but you raised the question on ma and if i could i just want to stress the fact that ma is a component of our capital allocation framework it is not the component of our capital allocation framework and unfortunately in our last call we gave the impression that there was a greater emphasis on ma than there had been in the past which we really never intended to do weve consistently shared that we look at opportunities all the time so a transaction like the parkway pipeline acquisition wouldnt come as a surprise but any ma transactions will need to compete for cash with our growth capital projects and our buybacks so just to be clear theres no greater emphasis on ma today than there was two years ago and our commitment to the other components of our capital allocation framework is really unchanged paul cheng  barclays capital inc thank you joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer you bet operator and thank you our next question comes from philip gresh from jpmorgan phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer morning phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc just following up on the capex side of things youre tracking well below for the full year were you always expecting to be a little bit more back half loaded because of the turnarounds or would you say maybe there is some degree of conservatism in the capital budget outlook being maintained in the  billion for the year john locke  vice president–investor relations well we are tracking a little bit below the  billion i mean lane do you have any idea on the timing of some of these projects r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering yeah what i would say with what weve disclosed and we have a large turnaround at port arthur in the third quarter and fourth quarter thats obvious thats a big big turnaround and that is a known quantity in terms of our sort of ratable spend i would say were still holding for this  billion but well see because in terms of capital projects the ratability is such that november december its difficult to spend a lot of money during that time of year so and ill just leave it at that phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then the second question the return of capital discussion you mentioned cash available via drops some of your peers have been pretty active with capital raises and drops so far this year feels like the market is opening up for quality mlps maybe with the pull back in oil now maybe a little less well see but how are you thinking about the back half of the year on this front john locke  vice president–investor relations as far as the drop phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc yeah in terms of desire to raise capital and do drops john locke  vice president–investor relations okay right now we have no change to the strategy to grow our lp primarily through the dropdown we do believe a measured pace is prudent and our guidance is still  million to  million that we gave in the first quarter call we will continue to look at thirdparty logistics still that support valeros core business and again in regard to the capital markets on the equity side obviously theyve been improving and they have improved throughout the quarter debt markets look very good joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer so i guess well continue to keep an eye on it were not prepared right now to change what weve shared that were planning to do phil were all watching this to see are we dealing with a new normal or are we dealing with just a spike in the market that was driven by the financial situation we had last year and so well continue to eyeball it weve got again plenty of assets that we could drop we got significant ebitda there we continue to look for opportunities to grow the lp with potential joint ventures and some smaller acquisitions but were very attentive to it phil m gresh  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks operator and thank you our next question comes from roger read with wells fargo roger d read  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning roger d read  wells fargo securities llc i guess some of the main topics have been hit if maybe we could dive just a little bit deeper into the concern about run cuts and then maybe the outlook for turnarounds beyond just port arthur for you as were looking into the fall joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer run cuts john locke  vice president–investor relations yeah so i guess on run cuts we continue to have margin to run in our system we feel good about the fact that we have this natural gas advantage and feedstock cost advantage in the gulf that puts us in a very good position globally in the refining industry so were not feeling any pressure for run cuts but i do agree that were going to need some rebalancing in the market so going forward i think youll see some run cuts in the third quarter and fourth quarter im not sure where those will occur probably northwest europe and some of them in the northeastern united states where youre already starting to hear some in the press of run cuts in todays market ill let lane comment on the future turnarounds r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering yeah roger we disclosed the port arthur turnaround just because it was so material and we wanted to make sure it was out there its not a normal way we communicate in terms of providing any additional information on our forwardlooking statements with respect to our turnarounds roger d read  wells fargo securities llc okay maybe a broader question about turnarounds and experience where weve had these oversupply situations is it valeros experience or would you say its maybe the industry broadly that when you have a weak margin environment youll take advantage of opportunities given that economic costs are much lower of doing a turnaround or that maybe you dont try to force product through the noncrude unit if you have a big crude unit turnaround just sort of curious of do you take advantage in a situation where weve come off several years of high margins and a big economic cost to turnaround do you see that – is that one of the ways the industry sort of corrects the imbalance here r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering so first ill comment on valero so we have a strategy of planning our turnarounds a couple of years in advance and executing our turnarounds as they come up we have a big system and we feel like we by virtue of being disciplined in doing that we dont try to move our turnarounds based on what prompt economics are now  rest of the industry there may be some of that i cant say that theres not im sure that people are looking at whether the refineries are struggling from a maintenance perspective they may bring the maintenance forward and just fix whatever it is and if you want to call that a turnaround you might say that i would say thats essentially about all that there is roger d read  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator and thank you our next question comes from doug leggate with bank of america doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch thank you good morning everybody joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer morning doug doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch joe i guess my first one might be for mike mike i just wonder if you could help us understand the strength of the cash flow in the quarter just as it relates to reported income and dda it looks like theres some other moving parts in there and my followup is on the industry please michael s ciskowski  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay so on the cash flow we had a change in cash of building  cash for the quarter of  billion but of that amount  million was due to favorable working capital changes so we had an increase in our payables and receivables and you net those together its about  million benefit we had an increase in our taxes payable of roughly  million and then we decreased our inventories in the quarter by about  million so that nets to the  billion of working capital benefit doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch great that helps me close the gap thanks joe my followup is on i guess its more of a kind of margin question in terms of the octane premium that hasnt appeared to materialize this summer you mentioned in your prepared remarks octane enhancement or projects might be something that valero continues to look at is  just a oneoff or do you still think that there is going to be a call for increased alkylate production or whatever it happens to be in the future and ill leave it there thanks joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you doug okay so gary or lane you guys want to tag team it gary k simmons  senior vice presidentsupply international operations and systems optimization yeah ill start doug and then let lane talk about the projects a little bit so what weve seen in the market is actually the octane premiums on the west coast in the midcontinent in the group  market have been stronger this year than what they were last year however in the us gulf coast and the new york harbor weve seen weaker octane premiums and so if you kind of try to get your mind around whats going on i think a lot of that is the fact that where you really can store gasoline is in the us gulf coast and the new york harbor so when we had that steep contango earlier in the year people were storing gasoline they were largely storing premium grade summer gasoline and high octane blend components so in those markets in the harbor and the gulf coast as that inventorys come out its kind of caused the premiums to be a little weaker this year than what we saw in the past however in the group  market the west coast market where you dont have a lot of capabilities to store gasoline the octane values have actually been stronger than what we saw last year r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering so doug this is lane we still have a strategic view that octane has value and its really in the context of tier  is going to destroy a lot of octane and of course the autos on a goforward basis are looking at higher compression engines so they may in fact want higher octane fuel and the best way to make that we believe is its finding to find a way to get ngl into the transportation fuel and then convert that to octane so thats why we like our houston alkylation project and with that strategic view we look at other projects to if it meets our hurdle rates to produce additional octane in our system doug leggate  bank of america merrill lynch appreciate the full answer guys thats really helpful thank you operator and thank you our next question comes from blake fernandez with howard weil blake fernandez  howard weil hey guys good morning joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer hi blake fernandez  howard weil question for you i guess its kind of macro and also company specific but you obviously hit record levels on the export side at the same time were seeing increased gasoline imports into the us and so im just trying to get a sense of exactly whats going on is this more of a regional dynamic where gulf coast is really sending product to other parts of the world and europe is basically penetrating the east coast or just basically any color you can give us on that framework gary k simmons  senior vice presidentsupply international operations and systems optimization yeah blake this is gary i think its exactly what you said we see especially on gasoline exports that we have a competitive advantage going to mexico and south america and then largely due to jones act shipping were not as competitive going to the new york harbor as maybe northwest europe are so the natural flow of our barrels is to go south into south america and theres been an incentive to send barrels from northwest europe into the harbor blake fernandez  howard weil okay and just to clarify is houston – the startup of houston is that contributing to those exports or is that not really that material in the quarter gary k simmons  senior vice presidentsupply international operations and systems optimization no it really didnt have any material impact at all in the quarter blake fernandez  howard weil okay and if you dont mind just a final point of clarity i know you said on the economic run cuts youre not necessarily providing i guess an outlook on exactly where it would occur but if i heard the guidance correctly on midcon it looks like a pretty decent rollover quartertoquarter would that guidance contemplate any economic run cuts that youre planning to do inland r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering blake this is lane and the way ill answer that is today we have positive economics in the midcon obviously the region is landlocked so we get into seasonal product containments potentially in sort of the fourth quarter and first quarter if that happens about every year blake fernandez  howard weil okay fair enough thank you operator and thank you our next question comes from jeff dietert with simmons  company jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international good morning joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international my question is on summer grade gasoline with the gasoline inventory overhang that weve got are you worried about moving your summer grade gasoline at a premium are you concerned that that might compress as we get closer to the end of the summer driving season weve heard some discussion about already shifting to winter grade gasoline production does that make any sense gary k simmons  senior vice presidentsupply international operations and systems optimization yeah jeff this is gary i dont think theres really a concern on being able to clear out the overhang of the summer grade spec gasoline and moving it out to the market and i guess to your second comment yes we are hearing that there are people starting to put some winter grade gasoline into some of the markets especially into the harbor jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international and secondly you reported i think record light product yield gasoline yield we saw  up  yearonyear industry to doe stats show it up maybe slightly more than that what would you attribute the increase in gasoline yield to in the second quarter what were the primary factors r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering hey so jeff this is lane i would say weve been in a strong maximum gasoline signal for the most part up until about a month ago and so our assets we just had them pointed to try to make as much gasoline as possible when you compare it yearoveryear there were times last year we maybe didnt have a strong signal to maximize our reformers as much as we have this year and its really the naphtha discount but i would just say thats sort of the yearoveryear difference jeffery alan dietert  simmons  company international great thanks for your comments joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer you bet operator and thank you our next question comes from ed westlake with credit suisse edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah good morning you shouted out on the front page ample supplies of medium and heavy sour crude obviously which your system can process better than others is that a comment about the sort of opec barrels or are you seeing things like in venezuela i mean as they run out of power are they having to puke out some sort of real heavy rubbish at cheap discounts that you can run and others cant john locke  vice president–investor relations i think we see good supplies in the middle east south america and canada as well i dont know that weve seen a lot in terms of change in behavior from venezuela we continue to see good supply and will from venezuela the grades are a little bit different so we see a lot more what we call diluted crude oil or dco and less of some of the synthetic barrels  that type of thing thats the only change that weve seen edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker right but presumably those dcos you can run through your system at a better economics than the synthetic barrels john locke  vice president–investor relations yes typically they have more difficulty placing the dco than they would a synthetic barrel edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker that makes sense okay and then a separate question with the cash pile plus organic free cash flow well obviously see how refining works out in the second half and your inventory in vlp a question about sort of how you plan to kind of grow the ebitda inventory that you could then subsequently drop down into vlp obviously youre doing  million to  million of dropdowns but should we think of that number being the same number as how you want to grow the top of the funnel of logistics inventory at the parent im trying to think about sort of mediumterm capex allocation to logistics joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah no and thats a good question so we have a lot of activity underway right now both for kind of organic projects which tend to be smaller in their nature but also some opportunity to acquire assets really to extend the supply chain into – in all of our refineries and so ed we made it a point really not to get out over our skis and talk about the specific opportunities until we were comfortable how the business case looked and really to firm up the opportunity but we do have a lot going on so we are focused on continuing to expand the logistics side of the business and obviously those assets would be those that support the system would bring to vlp some third party volumes and then continue to expand the dropdown inventory edward george westlake  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks so much operator and thank you our next question is from paul sankey with wolfe research paul sankey  wolfe research llc hi good morning everyone joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer hey paul paul sankey  wolfe research llc i had a couple of questions which actually were the first questions asked about halfanhour ago so i appreciate the details i was going to ask about rins i just wanted – as a followup is there an alternate strategy if the lawsuit fails i mean what really is the next recourse after that joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer well you know paul the obvious operating strategy is to try to go ahead and continue to find ways to blend more right so expansion of our wholesale marketing business is something that weve got a key eye on obviously acquiring terminaling assets would provide that opportunity and then continuing to try to build the export markets to try to alleviate some of the burden of the rin those are all things that we look at regularly and really ongoing other than that you just continue to bang away on the rock and you try to get people to recognize the fact that the system that we have today is broken that it is creating windfalls for some and its creating disadvantages for others and the playing field isnt level and i can tell you that based on the conversations that we have theres an understanding of this issue and theres an understanding that the rfs isnt intending what it was intended to do which was increase the amount of biofuels blended and we believe that thats caused by the structural problem that weve talked about earlier so were not going to give up the fight well continue to push it both from a regulatory and a legislative perspective and then from an operating perspective paul sankey  wolfe research llc yep understood good luck with that and then the other one was again pretty much the first question you answered which is regarding the market environment if the demand is higher this year than last year in the us is it a function of extra refineries being added do you think globally new capacity or is it more that the competitive advantage of the atlantic basin nonus refiners has improved and therefore theyre running stronger or i would imagine its a combination of both but any sort of market commentary you have on that would be great thanks john locke  vice president–investor relations yeah i would say a lot of it is really more a result of utilization especially utilization in periods where typically we see refineries cut so as i talked about typically you get refineries cutting in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and this year we saw refineries running very high utilization rates and a lot of that was just due to the steep contango that was in the market paul sankey  wolfe research llc yeah understood and then finally from me the demand side it seems to be sort of being revised lower in the us is that a concern for you guys do you think that the demand is being overstated or do you really think that this is a supply problem thank you joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer i can just comment on what were seeing through our wholesale demand domestically and were seeing good demand through that wholesale channel so yearoveryear our gasoline volumes through wholesale are up  and even on the distillate side were moving about  more through the wholesale channel of diesel than what we did last year paul sankey  wolfe research llc great thats helpful thank you operator and thank you our next question is from faisel khan with citigroup faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks good morning joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer hi faisel faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker hi joe just going back to the question that jeff dietert asked on the sort of switching from summer grade to winter grade and people already putting gasoline in inventory for the winter do you think thats a risk or do you think this is a oneoff that hopefully we dont carry this excess inventory from the summer into the winter joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer it certainly is a risk its always a risk thats out there and will depend on what the market structure is but i think after weve gone through this period where the markets been weaker this year i dont think its as great a risk as what we saw in the winter where people were storing the summer grade faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay got you and then just with the outages in canada that we saw over the summer early in the summer have you seen those volumes completely recover and how are you dealing with that disruption and how is that evolving as production ramps back up for you guys john locke  vice president–investor relations yeah so i think for us on the canadian heavy side we pretty much are seeing all the volume back available to us and the canadian heavy barrels are being priced very competitively versus either another heavy sour alternative or medium sour alternative so i would say that weve fully recovered from those fires so far faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay great thanks for the time guys operator and thank you our next question comes from chi chow with tudor pickering holt chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc hey thanks good morning joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer hi chi chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc hi joe this question may be the same as pauls couple questions ago but just this rin issue is kind of cropping back up this year do you think theres any vulnerability to the merchant refining model that you have longer term given the rin issue or anything else that may be out there joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer well it would probably be hard to say that the rin was helpful to the merchant refining model okay obviously its not but then you get into what are the options for dealing with it and i think i mentioned those earlier chi specifically from valeros perspective the retail marketing business isnt something thats currently on our radar screen we believe theres better ways to deal with the issue and so i really dont have anything to add to that but i think certainly its an issue that were working very hard to deal with because it does it puts an expense on the merchant refiner that he shouldnt be bearing today and so that creates a real problem it creates an unlevel playing field in the marketplace and thats never good so anyway well continue to address it the way we are chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc yeah thanks joe for those thoughts maybe a question on aruba theres been a lot of industry chatter about venezuelas interest in aruba lately but youve written the whole asset off at this point so are you suggesting that theres no option going forward to sell or transfer the plant to another operator joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer im looking at jay to see what we say about this jay d browning  executive vice president  general counsel the option to transfer its still there i mean its just a function of the financial requirements weve chosen to write off chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay so you can still transfer but for free basically is that kind of what youre signaling joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i guess so chi chow  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay great thanks for that joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer okay chi operator and thank you our next question comes from brad heffern with rbc capital markets brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer morning brad brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc just a followup to jeffs question a little while ago on yield lane you mentioned the systems been running at maximum gasoline yield for quite a while now and i think there was maybe an implication which you said that youre not running quite at maximum gasoline anymore im curious just how youre thinking about your yield decisions these days i would assume that given the incentives in the market at the moment youre probably running a little more distillate with more of a distillate focus than you had been but how are you thinking about making catalyst decisions and so on that affect the next  months  months r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering so we are currently in i would say maxjet mode so the decision you make there is between our cut point between jet and naphtha and naphtha shows up in our sort of our overall results as a gasoline although its not really we export it for maximizing jet – were still actually maximizing gasoline is the next step and its largely due to butane blending economics and it has to do with what we would call the swing cut  between the heavy part of cat gasoline and lto and theres drilling  economics as well to bring butane into the pull so thats how were postured today but were very close on all these things just because of where the relative cracks are in terms of catalyst choices fccs we can change relatively quickly i would say if we want – most of the time there we make a decision on whether we want to try to fill our alkylation capacity catalytically with like vsm  and not run as much rate and thats normally what we do in the winter and were certainly looking at that and i would be surprised if we didnt end up there and on hydrocrackers every three years we make that decision and that really is a choice between – its not really gasoline and diesel in our hydrocrackers its really naphtha and diesel and so were still biased on the side of making distillate out of our big hydrocrackers brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc okay got it thanks for that color and then i was curious if you could talk a little bit about the results in the north atlantic this quarter the indicator was up  sequentially but the margin was down what were the contributing factors to the performance gary k simmons  senior vice presidentsupply international operations and systems optimization yeah brad this is gary i would tell you that the big factor that we saw there if youre looking yearoveryear was our feedstock costs so as youre aware last year we had a pretty good incentive to move us gulf coast barrels to quebec and we had a very good feedstock advantage doing that but with the brent tir coming in we lost a lot of that advantage and its impacted our north atlantic basin results brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc okay is that an yard  that youre still taking advantage of in the first quarter im just thinking about it on a sequential basis versus the first quarter and the margin was down as well joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so – yeah so we move an occasional cargo to quebec but even when were moving it its not near the margin that we saw last year when the yard  was much wider brad heffern  rbc capital markets llc okay ill leave it at that thanks operator and thank you our next question comes from spiro dounis with ubs spiro m dounis  ubs securities llc hey good morning gentlemen thanks for taking the question just two quick ones hopefully first just on the opex figures are pretty strong this quarter despite i guess slightly lower utilization i guess just wondering how repeatable that is i know next quarter it sounds like going to tick up a bit just given the turnarounds but beyond that just wondering if there is sort of belttightening going on and how much more we could see of that r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering so this is lane were always belttightening i mean we run our business very disciplined were always very attentive to all of our costs and thats just the way we run our business i would say our throughput is largely drive the – when you sort of compare quartertoquarter year over year it has to do with what our relative throughputs were through that timeframe that affects things and obviously natural gas has a big hand in this but those are really the two when you start really looking at our – at least our cash operating expenses its really the energy and it has to do with our throughput spiro m dounis  ubs securities llc got it that makes sense and then just second one seems like west coast was a bit of a bright spot over the last quarter both on margins and cost and i guess just focusing on margins i guess how sustainable is that i guess over the last few weeks theyve come in a bit but i know driving in the west coast has been pretty strong and seems like demand there is pretty strong and on top of that i think some of the stockpile levels are a bit better than the rest of the us im just wondering how youre viewing that market john locke  vice president–investor relations yeah i think we feel pretty good about the west coast its a unique grade of gasoline in that market so it limits some of the stockpiling of barrels and certainly with the increased demand the production – the supplydemand balance is much tighter than it used to be spiro m dounis  ubs securities llc got it appreciate the color thanks guys operator and thank you we have a followup question from paul cheng with barclays paul cheng  barclays capital inc hey this is for gary and lane when you decide whether you want to stretch the yield between distillate and gasoline do you looking at the spot economic or that you also take into consideration of the future curve joseph w gorder  chairman president  chief executive officer do you want to take that one john locke  vice president–investor relations i would say we do a combination of both paul as you look we certainly – were making cutpoints decision its more done on a spot economic basis but when you talk about catalyst changes then were looking more – using the forward curve for those type of decisions paul cheng  barclays capital inc okay so just for the cut of the temperature and that would be just on the spot you wont be looking at say the next two months or three months what is the futures curve may suggest john locke  vice president–investor relations it comes into play but for the most part were looking at spot economics on making cut point changes because we can do that day to day in our refining system paul cheng  barclays capital inc and a final one if i may maybe this is either for lane and gary also if im looking at – if the third quarter market conditions would be extended the same as the second quarter given your expectation of your runs should we assume that your margin capture rate versus your valero index would be roughly about the same or that is something that we should be consider r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering paul this is lane i would say its going to be roughly the same with the exception of where feedstocks are i mean thats really the only real major variable in terms of our capture rates well start into butane blending at the end of the third quarter that will affect it a little bit as well paul cheng  barclays capital inc but that it wont start until september right the butane blending the butane blending wont start until september i presume r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering right and then – but itll – so therell be a little bit of that impact and the other one is we do – as weve said earlier weve disclosed that we have a big turnaround at the gulf  in our port arthur refinery starting in the third quarter paul cheng  barclays capital inc is that a full planned turnaround r lane riggs  executive vice president refining operations  engineering over the course of the timeframe most of the refineries with the exception of – of our conversion units will all be down but its really the crude and coking complex that will be coming down paul cheng  barclays capital inc okay thank you operator and thank you we have no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back over to john locke for closing remarks
