progressiveminded cpa firms are always on the lookout for ways of providing the best possible service to their clients  to serve the best interest of their clients they constantly monitor both opportunities as well as threats to their clients financial security  to properly assess the threat you may need new tools to evaluate your current referral process referral model or strategic alliance many cpas paint financial service firms with the same brush and view them as similar to each other  however an ernst  young survey in  concluded just the opposite  in the executive summary it stated the financial services industry must take on the imperative of developing a new paradigma nonlinear and nonpiecemeal paradigmthat better suits the current economic climate as well as risks and uncertainties likely to be encountered by baby boomers gen xs and millenials in the future it also predicted the future when asked about why the changes were not being accelerated by the financial institutions  the reasons were all too familiar why risk fixing something that does not seem to be brokenwhy invest time and money in new products and services that may not be as profitable as we sell todayhow do we educate a sales force to take on the new paradigm there is not a shortage of information for the cpa firm which wants to enter the arena of wealth building and preservation  much of the information comes from financial firms however and is biased and designed to generate profits for the stockholders and officers cornerstone wealth management endeavors to maintain an independent advisor status identifying and eliminating misinformation  this is the first step in converting information to knowledge  two main financial powers interest rates or rates of returnactuarial science investment companies want to tell you that it should all be subject to longterm market historical performance  insurance companies and banks tell you it should not have any risk  the key is to employ a macroeconomic approach to find the perfect blend of each of the two powers  each power left alone is inadequate in planning workshops we provide a business consulting workshop on a quarterly basis
