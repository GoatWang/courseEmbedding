tweet print tags maintenance and reliability made in america the phrase is starting to take on the same quaint anachronistic feel as say mr smith received a gold watch from the company after  years of loyal service its simply another stark reality of our globalizing world but to assume that american manufacturers have to padlock the factory doors and move overseas is to deny the innovative spirit – and bulldog determination – that birthed and nourished our nations economy just ask century furniture this hickory ncbased maker of fine highend home furnishings is doing what many view as the impossible it is keeping its factories open century nestled in the foothills of the appalachian mountains has seven manufacturing facilities and some  business partners the company doesnt call them employees because each one actually owns a stake in the business it is one of the last lonely holdouts in the area that proudly calls itself the furniture capital of america about twothirds of its wood manufacturing competitors have closed up shop and moved their manufacturing to china according to hardwood review weekly which keeps track of these statistics between  and   us furniture factories closed in  states totaling more than  lost jobs between  and  north carolina lost  percent of its  furniture jobs its not hard to understand why so many manufacturers have made the choice to move overseas says robert j maricich president and ceo of century furniture the average skilled american worker earns  times what his counterpart in china earns factor in our escalating healthcare costs and our far more stringent governmental restraints and you can see the depth of the challenge fortunately maricich is a man who thrives on challenge when he arrived at century in  the company was enjoying a banner year business was growing profits robust a record number of employees showed up every day to craft the expensive luxurious wood and upholstered furniture for which century is known but he barely had time to get his office set up when what he calls the perfect storm abruptly ended the sunny day in which his new company was basking september  triggered a massive decline in consumer confidence the stock market and consequently consumer spending on big ticket purchases prices plunged and simultaneously chinese imports shot through the roof in the wake of these dark days maricich and his leadership team made the decision to keep centurys manufacturing – the bulk of it at least – on american soil we had to honestly assess our strengths and weaknesses says maricich we had to identify those niches in which we could effectively compete and focus our energies on adding value to our products and services and yes we did have to cut our workforce –  percent across the board but here we are still standing we havent closed a single factory so how is century pulling off such a feat maricich answered that question when he spoke – alongside the ceos of starbucks best buy and other multibillion dollar firms – at the  leadership excellence summit at the us naval academy this summer in a presentation titled leadership in the global economy tactical principles for success in a new world he shared the following insights principle  when you find yourself in a hole stop digging take a long hard objective look at everything youre doing if it doesnt add value or maximize efficiency stop doing it if the customer doesnt care about it stop doing it rethink every process when you hear the words but weve always done it this way ignore them change is hard and it does upset numerous apple carts reflects maricich principle  take action you cannot afford to wait for all the facts knowing that uncertainty will always exist be a confident decision maker dont fall prey to analysis paralysis opportunities pass quickly and if you dont grab them quickly someone else will once youve made a decision dont fret over it no one has ever figured out how to turn back time and undo anything even if  hindsight proves your decision was a mistake well mistakes are learning vehicles for all of us principle  get comfortable with ambiguity the ambiguity i refer to here applies only to business decisions says maricich there is no ambiguity about integrity honesty and the core values that provide a moral rudder those qualities must remain constant however when operating in a globalizing economy there are few cutanddry rules there is no clear right and wrong even if you dont make the wrong choice you might not make the most right choice either accept that fact principle  find your brilliance and leverage it relentlessly every company must decide what it does best – indeed what it does better than anyone else – and infuse that brilliance into its entire operation century is differentiating itself via a threepronged approach  it provides a luxury experience to consumers by offering topoftheline quality and mass customization  it innovates relentlessly in products in design partnerships in sales strategies  in an industry known for moving at a snails pace century gets furniture to its customers on an average of three short weeks after the order is placed thats our brilliance and everything we do is based on being the best at bringing it to the customer says maricich we had tshirts made that say ‘we have one standard the best’ its a simple concept that everyone at every level understands its simplicity gives it its power if a worker sees a tiny flaw in the finish on a headboard she will make sure the problem is corrected in order to live up to that standard principle  being all things to all people is the golden rule for failure when maricich took over century the company had strayed outside its traditional fine home furnishings niche and was making furniture for hotels and yachts we had extraordinary competencies to make just about any kind of sofa chair bed dresser or table he says we let ourselves be lured into those arenas but ultimately we realized we couldnt really be competitive in these areas so we cut them out trying to be all things to all people doesnt allow you to differentiate it doesnt reward you for creativity and it doesnt reward you for fashion leadership in the end we walked away from  percent of our business principle  cut the fat leave the muscle get lean in addition to the aforementioned  percent reduction in workforce – which hit management and workers alike – century embraced lean manufacturing as a strategy the company focused on getting rid of all waste eliminating anything the customer wasnt willing to pay for it streamlined and reconfigured its upholstery plants reducing the distance an average piece of upholstery traveled from  feet to  feet thats a  percent reduction that results in the elimination of  miles each year says maricich by the way these items are pushed by hand not only does this save time it reduces dirty upholstery skirts fabric tears and broken furniture legs not to mention employee fatigue principle  embrace globalization take advantage of whats best in the world as long as it reinforces your strategy says maricich you can and probably should use outsourcing on a selective basis he says at century we stopped making chair frames for instance deciding it made sense to have those made overseas we leveraged our brilliance in finishing customizing and providing innovative design to the purchased frames    and our customers appreciate the value we create with that strategy principle  create a culture of trust a culture of trust centers on authenticity says maricich dont pretend you know all the answers and dont make promises you cant keep he says i have had to look into my employees eyes and say yes the plant might have to close yes you could lose your job but the future is in our hands and that is a good thing we are all going to pull together to do our best to keep this company going that was a difficult thing to do but it was also the right thing to do principle  foster a sense of ownership how do you instill an entrepreneurial mindset in your employees first says maricich ensure that your employees literally own a stake in their company century does so via its esop but just as importantly share your vision with your employees every chance you get the only way to create organizational clarity is to communicate the same message at all levels of your company he says whether i am talking to upholsterers or board members i make sure my message is the same this is the vision these are the initiatives these are the action steps principle  hire and retain the very best people you know the basic rules hire smart people passionate people people who fit your culture they all still apply but when youre hiring people who must do the nearimpossible ie keep your american factories running in a tough global economy youve got your work cut out for you you look like a big risk make it a priority to convince the best and brightest that you have an environment in which they can do their best work advises maricich learn how to play up your strengths for instance we use the finest materials in our furniture – exotic woods imported stone handhammered wrought iron exquisite fabrics – and thats a big draw for highly creative people they appreciate having access to such beautiful materials with which they can practice their art on the other end of the employment spectrum dont be afraid to cut people loose when the passion isnt there this is not just for your benefit but for theirs as well he adds principle  reward people for a job well done yes financial rewards are always welcome but dont forget the power of recognition and praise maricich an avid outdoorsman gives outstanding employees his special crystal bear award i dont give them out indiscriminately so these awards mean a lot to people who receive them he says we also look for fun ways to celebrate our successes at century there can be no success without celebration principle  innovate innovate innovate look outside the paradigm for new ideas when you have an innovative culture a culture filled with divergent thinkers who feel free to express their wildest ideas you have something no competitor can steal centurys innovative culture manifests in unusual products like the radial table from its oscar de la renta home collection the table based on an  design has a patented mechanism that allows its round top to expand making room for eight leaves that slide in between its pieshaped swirl mahogany wedges retailing for  it is centurys topselling table in both units and dollars and the highest margin item in its line likewise when century entered the leisure category four years ago it debuted a finishing process used on the outside of boat hulls to make furniture nearly impervious to weather this innovation allowed the company to be the first to use woods other than the teak family and to finish them to the same standards as indoor furniture maricich is a big believer in the philosophy if you cant hire it rent it thats why century collaborates with such diverse names as fashion giant oscar de la renta british interior designer kelly hoppen and international designer richard frinier principle  choose your customers or those who influence your customers century has fired a few retail partners who cannot meet the needs of affluent consumers simultaneously it is aggressively increasing the segment of its business that sells directly to professional interior designers i have never heard anyone say you know i finally used a designer to redo my living room and i really regret it laughs maricich people are always thrilled with the results when they hire a professional designer — and the kinds of people who do so are the same kinds of people we want as customers its a natural fit principle  give customers what they really want are you giving your customers what they really want or are you giving them what you want them to want just because you are in love with your own products and services doesnt mean the customer will be do continuous market research ask the customer what he or she wants keep an eye on trends that are revealing themselves and be mindful of how your company might leverage opportunities that arise from them this is no guarantee of success of course but it does make success more likely the luxury niche is hot right now says maricich in  louis vuitton lexus rolex manolo tiffany coach and starbucks all had record years that tells me that centurys target customer – the woman from the top  percent of all households earning more than  a year – is in a spending mood we just have to convince that woman to spend her money on us how do we do that by providing not just a luxury product but a luxury experience principle  practice perpetual optimism some psychologists believe there is a strong connection between a persons mood and his conception of the future maricich points out just the simple act of saying we have a plan calms people and creates a positive mood in the organization – which in turn makes it more likely that the plan will be successful to lead in an environment of ambiguity you must defeat anxiety in yourself so that you dont risk infecting the people around you strive to manage your moods employees will follow your lead principle  never ever be a victim i refuse to be a victim and i refuse to have victims working for me says maricich ive read that jack welch fired the bottom  percent of his workforce every year the people who comprised that  percent were victim types who could no longer effect change and drive the business forward jack was right – victims and other low performers bring everyone else down with them the message is clear even as the world transforms itself oldfashioned strong leadership superb quality and uncompromising service still count i do not believe outsourcing is an inevitability concludes maricich but more important than the final outcome is this lesson dont give up without a fight in the s everyone thought japan would take over the world well clearly it hasnt china is the emerging powerhouse right now in manufacturing but the key phrase is right now there will always be another china we as an industry and as a nation will always face challenges so we always need to be
