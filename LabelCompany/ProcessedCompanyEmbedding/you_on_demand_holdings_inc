financial statements included in this report for  the amount consisted primarily of proceeds received from the sale of our equity securities from our june  financings we anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds to fully implement our business model and related strategies we believe we have the ability to raise funds by various methods including utilization of our  million shelf registration as well as other means of financing the fact that we have incurred significant continuing losses and continue to rely on debt and equity financings to fund our operations to date could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty as of december   the company has an accumulated operating loss of

pattern may change however as a result of new market opportunities or new product introductions critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported including the notes thereto and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies if any we have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements these accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements difficult subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from managements current judgments we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  variable interest entities we account for entities qualifying as vies in accordance with fasb topic consolidation  vies are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the variable interest entity a vie is an entity for which the primary beneficiarys interest in the entity can change with changes in factors other than the amount of investment in the entity      revenue recognition revenue is recorded as services are provided to customers we generally recognize all revenue in the period in which the service is rendered provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured we record deferred revenue for payments received from customers for the performance of future services and recognizes the associated revenue in the period that the services are performed  licensed content the company obtains content through content license agreements and revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors the license agreement may or may not be recognized in licensed content when the license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title the title does not meet the criteria for recognition in licensed content in accordance with financial accounting standards boards fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  entertainment  broadcasters  in the event the license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title in content license agreements that do not specify the license fee per title we expense as costs of revenues the greater of revenue sharing costs incurred through the end of the reporting period or the proportionate value of total minimum license fees expensed on a straightline basis over the term of each license agreement as the company expenses license fees on a straightline basis it may result in deferred or prepaid license fees prepaid license fees are classified as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets as licensed content and deferred license fees are classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred license fees  intangible assets and goodwill we account for intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  asc  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be evaluated for impairment at least annually asc  also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  goodwill is allocated to reporting units which are either the operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment on an annual basis we review goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances makes it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount goodwill is further tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of its reporting units determined using externally quoted prices if available or a discounted cash flow model and when deemed necessary a market approach  foreign currency translation the businesses of our operating subsidiaries are currently conducted in and from china in renminbi the company makes no representation that any renminbi or us dollar amounts could have been or could be converted into us dollars or renminbi as the case may be at any particular rate the rates stated below or at all the chinese government imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of renminbi into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade the company uses the us dollar as its reporting and functional currency translation adjustments are reported as other comprehensive income or expenses and accumulated as other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet financial information is translated into us dollars at prevailing or current rates respectively except for revenues and expenses which are translated at average current rates during the reporting period exchange gains and losses resulting from retained profits are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  business combinations we account for acquisitions according to asc  business combinations asc  requires that upon initially obtaining control an acquirer should recognize  of the fair values of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions even if the acquirer has not acquired  of its target additionally contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration and transaction costs will be expensed as incurred this statement also modifies the recognition for pre acquisition contingencies such as environmental or legal issues restructuring plans and acquired research and development value in purchase accounting this statement amends asc  income taxes  to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital depending on the circumstances recent accounting pronouncements management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect
