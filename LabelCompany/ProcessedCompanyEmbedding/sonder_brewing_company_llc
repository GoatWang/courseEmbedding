grahamstaff updated  pm friday june     posted  am thursday june   butler county — the craft beer boom shows no signs of fizzing out instead it’s pouring its efforts into new ventures across ohio and butler county and contributing to the economic growth of botha new biennial economic impact study commissioned by the national beer wholesalers association and the beer institute shows that industry growth exploded in recent years contributing more than  billion to ohio’s economy in  that’s a  billion increase from  in  the state was home to  craft breweries now there are at least  butler county

oxford brewery pub bringing new restaurant to hamilton planned to open in neighboring warren county this year are sonder brewing  lots brewing company both in mason“i think that’s a great thing” said matt chapman  who has visited rivertown brewery  barrel house in monroe and crooked handle brewing co in springboro and shopped at the casual pint in mason “it used to be something that was difficult to come by and find things but at this point it’s becoming more and more prevalent with the area” rivertown brewery and barrel house’s new  million facility opened in monroe in january in a building constructed to be twice the size of its lockland locationfounded in  rivertown produced approximately  barrels of beer a year by  nearly  barrels are projected to be produced this year in monroethe craft beer industry will continue to grow because people are looking for more flavorful options across the board in not only the food they eat but the beverages they drink according to lindsey roeper “dream facilitator” and coowner of rivertown brewing related rivertown brewing in monroe includes restaurant “gone are the days of drinking or eating the same thing day in and day out” roeper said “people’s palates are really changing and it’s exciting because the generation that is coming up is being exposed to all of these different flavors”justin hemminger spokesman for the ohio craft brewers association said the boom in craft breweries directly correlates toward an overall market trend of eating and drinking local“the biggest growth we’ve seen in craft beer has been at the nanobrewery level” he said referring to scaleddown microbreweries often run by a solo entrepreneur that produce beer in small batches “nanobrewery growth was the primary driver of all craft beer growth last year”the “overwhelming majority” of those getting into craft brewing as a business started out as home brewers or craft beer enthusiasts not solely as entrepreneurs looking to cash in on a hot trend other dogberry stays true to roots in new larger west chester location “most of the people opening craft breweries right now they realize it’s a good climate to try it and to try and sell beer but they’re more concerned about making excellent beer versus it being a strict dollarsandcents proposition” hemminger saidwhile last year’s lifting of the abv limit was helpful to level the proverbial playing field for brewers but not something that in and of itself spurred growth in the industryfounded in  the ohio craft brewers association counts  members out of the  operating craft breweries in the state it also has more than  allied members in a wide variety of fields including packaging insurance mechanical systems architecture and farming“the local economy around the craft brewing industry has very long arms” hemminger said other swine city brewing plans summer debut in fairfield ocba realized that even more after the launch of its new free app ohio on tap which amassed  users in just a month following its launch the app informs beer fans where craft brewing establishments are located and its passport program rewards them for various increments of visits with prizes like lapel pin hats metal signs and the grand prize of “enthusiast” membership in the organization which comes with merchandise discounts and other incentivizing aspectsthe app is capitalizing on a nationwide trend the beer serves america study concluded that the us beer industry has a  billion overall impact on the economy and generates more than  million jobs providing  billion in wages and benefits it also paid more than  billion in taxesthe amount of beer purchased at brewery locations has doubled in last three years from  million barrels in  to  million barrels in  hemminger said“we’re seeing a dramatic increase in people going to breweries to buy and consume beer” he saidcraft brewing is having an impact on communities across the state and nation including hamilton which welcomed municipal brew works in june  to the city’s former municipal building more municipal brew works marks year anniversary with bottle release city manager joshua smith said the effect the business continues to have is readily apparent“you can see the direct impact municipal brew works has had on our downtown in terms of patrons using the facility” smith said “what is hard to estimate is the number of dollars that are spent by shoppers who would not otherwise be in downtown hamilton but for municipal brew works drawing them here and what other businesses will locate in our downtown due to them being there“the president of cmc properties specifically cited municipal brew works being one of a few reasons they decided to invest almost  million in their new mixed use development the marcum”the craft brewing boom also is reverberating across the retail market leading to the opening of storefronts that pour beer from dozens of taps as well as sell it from cans bottles and growlers craftbeer bottle shop and lounge bc’s bottle lodge opened in  in liberty twp and the casual pint opened a location this month in mason related craft beer chain casual pint opens new mason bar restaurant jungle jim’s international market’s locations in fairfield and eastgate have added to their selection of craft beers as the industry expands and even holds entire festivals dedicated to itthe fairfield grocer’s craft beer department which includes  different domestic and imported beers is “consistently near the top of the heap if not at the top” when it comes to the amount of money generated and the volume of product sold according to jungle jim’s spokesman jared bowers“we have great working relationships with local breweries … so we’re able to get great deals for people and just move a lot more product than you would ever think possible” bowers saidthe popularity of craft beer has led to yearoveryear steady sales growth of between  and  percent at jungle jim’s and spawned inhouse promotions like pint night and several jungle jim’s festivals including this weekend’s th annual international craft beer fest as well as the barrel aged beer bash buckeye beer bash and the fall smash more new craft beer lounge opens in liberty twp it helps of course that jungle jim’s entered the craft beer market in its infancy back in the mid to late s when many west coast craft beer companies were starting to get their product out more“that’s when we saw what it was going to become and we dove in feet first and we’ve been rockin’ and rollin’ ever since” bowers saidconsumers’ everchanging palates give brewers an opportunity to think far outside the box and come up with different ingredients and fermentation techniques to set themselves apart and meet that demand roeper said“because people are always looking for more there’s always more beer that can be brewed which is very exciting” she saidin addition taking the same recipe from an ohio brewery and producing it elsewhere in the country means a “very different” taste due to different house flavors from the yeast different yeast cultures that are used different fermentation techniques different equipment and even different water more new brewery near kings island plans more than beer existing and soontoopen breweries are great additions to the county’s already vibrant tourism product lineup according to tracy kocher director of marketing for the butler county visitors bureau“they provide great additional things for people to get out and see do and experience” kocher said “in today’s tourism economy the local experience is really key … and each of those breweries in butler county has unique offerings anytime we can support local businesses with local offerings it’s great from a tourism standpoint”coming to the county to partake of a particular brewery or two will likely lead to money spent elsewhere bolstering the overall local economy in the process she saidchapman said the wide selection of local breweries in the region gives him the opportunity to take friends and family from out of town to enjoy a brew“i’ve got family from california that comes in and they get to … try beers that they probably don’t even have access to today just because the distribution doesn’t necessarily get that far” he said by the numbers beer industry in ohio  billion how much the beer
