dangerously promoted stock  ubiquity broadcasting corp otcmktsubiqold  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»ubiquity inc the red flags are ubiquitous around this dangerously promoted stockdec  about ubiquity broadcasting ubiq investor protection association short onlysummarywe have received numerous emails touting ubiq from various stock promotersthe timing of the emails promoting ubiq coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in the trading volume of the stockthe recent financials of the company appear to be very bleak due to nearly zero revenue and negative incomewe have tried contacting the company via the online form on the companys website however it appears to be out of servicenote this article is about a microcap stock also referred to as a penny stock while all investments are risky microcap stocks are among the most risky among microcap stocks the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns such as ubiquity otcqbubiq they are also among the most illiquid stocks usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment quite often it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position ubiq is no exception to that ubiq is a microcap stock which is traded on the otcbb and priced well below the  mark the readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article introduction trading in ubiquity inc has become much more active during the trading sessions in proximity to november  compared to previous activity in the stock it so happens that beginning on this very same date we have started receiving a large number of promotional emails from various stock promoters touting the stock in this article we will outline the facts that are in our opinion related to the increase in the trading volume of this usually thinly traded low volume stock the promotion let us analyze the recent price action and trade volume of ubiq the trading volume of ubiq had increased significantly on the dates nearing november the th the date when the first promotional email was received the stock had continued trading on an abnormally large volume compared to before november on trading sessions following that date it is quite obvious to us that the emails being sent out throughout the month of november and the rise in the trading volume of the stock during that same period are interconnected events emails received on ubiq ubiq chart the reality nearly zero revenue negative income bright future as often happens with aggressively promoted companies a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture it seems ubiquity inc is no exception to that rule in our opinion it is clear that the price of ubiq has nothing in common with the stocks true value if we take a look at ubiqs income statement we can see that the companys revenue has remained nearly zero while the companys net income has been negative during the entire year of  it is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that ubiqs current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at overinflated prices rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market but why you ask the reason why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised that is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock the answer for this hides of course in the small print let us have a look at the disclaimers found in the promotional emails touting ubiq which weve received or or in simple plain english someone  maybe the promoter sending out the email message or a third party who might have paid the promoter in cash for sending the message  is holding shares of ubiq and plans to get rid of them dump them in the open market therefore our conclusion is that the promotional emails sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices while the promoters or third party unload their shares upon them conclusion it is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article we hold the opinion that ubiq shares are essentially worthless we believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock this practice is well known see pump and dump and is done exclusively for one reason only  so the insiders can unload dump their shares which they had previously acquired for almost free in the free market onto unsuspecting investors while taking advantage of the stocks inflated price in view of that we hold the opinion that any investor who had purchased shares of the company should consider liquidating his entire position immediately even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing our view we must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation ivan illich for longs if you are long the stock we believe you should consider getting out immediately it is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stocks price is likely to be temporary as it will never repeat its previous highs we believe ubiq has a price target of around  which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks or months at most if you have already accrued losses on the stock it may be a good idea to sell now so as to avoid additional losses do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many we believe ubiqs stock price will drop  or more in the following weeks it may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now a man must be big enough to admit his mistakes smart enough to profit from them and strong enough to correct them john c maxwell for shorts bearing the aforementioned facts in mind we believe sophisticated investors will quickly comprehend the idea that shorting ubiq may be a lucrative opportunity as we are convinced that the potential downside for ubiq is substantial if you are able to locate borrows we believe shorting ubiq may prove to be profitable as its price may prove to be highly inflated disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours the author wrote this article
