flexible reasonablypriced credit there were several attempts to set up farming banks including crédit foncier de france in  but none was successful birth of crédit agricole and creation of the local and regional banks   edit jules méline spearheaded the creation of the first local banks crédit agricole can trace its history back to the end of the th century and specifically to the act of  establishing the freedom of professional association which authorised among other things the creation of farm unions and the foundation of local mutual banks société de crédit agricole was created on  february  at salinslesbains in the district of poligny in the jura region it was the first of its kind in france drawing on this experience and in an effort to promote lending to small family farms the act of  november  which had the support of minister for agriculture jules méline paved the way for the creation of crédit agricole’s local banks the first local banks were set up by local elites including agronomists teachers and property owners with farmers playing a minority role in the early years business was made up exclusively of shortterm loans provided as advances on harvests enabling farmers to live more comfortably mediumterm and longterm loans were added later making it possible to buy equipment and livestock the  act did not confer any financial advantages and the local banks soon faced financial problems such as a lack of capital and insufficient collateral from small farmers it was not until  that the government addressed these problems by requiring the banque de france to provide funding to crédit agricole through an endowment of  million gold francs and an annual fee of  million francs a year later the act of  resolved the collateral issues meanwhile the act of  march  instituted a commission within the ministry for agriculture to distribute the government advances between the regional banks which were also created at this time these cooperative entities brought together the local banks in their catchment area and acted as their clearing organisations building nationwide coverage   edit more and more local and regional banks were established from the turn of the century by the eve of the first world war every region had at least one but the government continued to provide threequarters of the funding and shortterm lending still accounted for the lion’s share of business despite the authorisation to issue longterm loans granted by the acts of  december  and  march  with some regions becoming isolated owing to the war the need for a central bank to regulate business became more apparent especially as crédit agricole was asked to provide financing to rebuild farming operations damaged during the conflict in the s the bank continued to build its nationwide coverage and expand its business activities notably by introducing loans to smallscale rural craftsmen in  financing rural electrification and financing local authorities in rural areas from  the act of  august  gave greater independence to what was at that time a credit department reporting directly to the ministry for agriculture and established a public central clearing

french farmers struggled to obtain longterm flexible reasonablypriced credit there were several attempts to set up farming banks including crédit foncier de france in  but none was successful birth of crédit agricole and creation of the local and regional banks   edit jules méline spearheaded the creation of the first local banks crédit agricole can trace its history back to the end of the th century and specifically to the act of  establishing the freedom of professional association which authorised among other things the creation of farm unions and the foundation of local mutual banks société de crédit agricole was created on  february  at salinslesbains in the district of poligny in the jura region it was the first of its kind in france drawing on this experience and in an effort to promote lending to small family farms the act of  november  which had the support of minister for agriculture jules méline paved the way for the creation of crédit agricole’s local banks the first local banks were set up by local elites including agronomists teachers and property owners with farmers playing a minority role in the early years business was made up exclusively of shortterm loans provided as advances on harvests enabling farmers to live more comfortably mediumterm and longterm loans were added later making it possible to buy equipment and livestock the  act did not confer any financial advantages and the local banks soon faced financial problems such as a lack of capital and insufficient collateral from small farmers it was not until  that the government addressed these problems by requiring the banque de france to provide funding to crédit agricole through an endowment of  million gold francs and an annual fee of  million francs a year later the act of  resolved the collateral issues meanwhile the act of  march  instituted a commission within the ministry for agriculture to distribute the government advances between the regional banks which were also created at this time these cooperative entities brought together the local banks in their catchment area and acted as their clearing organisations building nationwide coverage   edit more and more local and regional banks were established from the turn of the century by the eve of the first world war every region had at least one but the government continued to provide threequarters of the funding and shortterm lending still accounted for the lion’s share of business despite the authorisation to issue longterm loans granted by the acts of  december  and  march  with some regions becoming isolated owing to the war the need for a central bank to regulate business became more apparent especially as crédit agricole was asked to provide financing to rebuild farming operations damaged during the conflict in the s the bank continued to build its nationwide coverage and expand its business activities notably by introducing loans to smallscale rural craftsmen in  financing rural electrification and financing local authorities in rural areas from  the act of  august  gave greater independence to what was at that time a credit department reporting directly to the ministry for agriculture and established a public central clearing organisation for the regional banks the office national de crédit agricole was thus set up with louis tardy as its chief executive officer in  the institution was

credit there were several attempts to set up farming banks including crédit foncier de france in  but none was successful birth of crédit agricole and creation of the local and regional banks   edit jules méline spearheaded the creation of the first local banks crédit agricole can trace its history back to the end of the th century and specifically to the act of  establishing the freedom of professional association which authorised among other things the creation of farm unions and the foundation of local mutual banks société de crédit agricole was created on  february  at salinslesbains in the district of poligny in the jura region it was the first of its kind in france drawing on this experience and in an effort to promote lending to small family farms the act of  november  which had the support of minister for agriculture jules méline paved the way for the creation of crédit agricole’s local banks the first local banks were set up by local elites including agronomists teachers and property owners with farmers playing a minority role in the early years business was made up exclusively of shortterm loans provided as advances on harvests enabling farmers to live more comfortably mediumterm and longterm loans were added later making it possible to buy equipment and livestock the  act did not confer any financial advantages and the local banks soon faced financial problems such as a lack of capital and insufficient collateral from small farmers it was not until  that the government addressed these problems by requiring the banque de france to provide funding to crédit agricole through an endowment of  million gold francs and an annual fee of  million francs a year later the act of  resolved the collateral issues meanwhile the act of  march  instituted a commission within the ministry for agriculture to distribute the government advances between the regional banks which were also created at this time these cooperative entities brought together the local banks in their catchment area and acted as their clearing organisations building nationwide coverage   edit more and more local and regional banks were established from the turn of the century by the eve of the first world war every region had at least one but the government continued to provide threequarters of the funding and shortterm lending still accounted for the lion’s share of business despite the authorisation to issue longterm loans granted by the acts of  december  and  march  with some regions becoming isolated owing to the war the need for a central bank to regulate business became more apparent especially as crédit agricole was asked to provide financing to rebuild farming operations damaged during the conflict in the s the bank continued to build its nationwide coverage and expand its business activities notably by introducing loans to smallscale rural craftsmen in  financing rural electrification and financing local authorities in rural areas from  the act of  august  gave greater independence to what was at that time a credit department reporting directly to the ministry for agriculture and established a public central clearing organisation for the regional banks the office national de crédit agricole was thus set up with louis tardy as its chief executive officer in  the institution was renamed caisse nationale de crédit agricole cnca and crédit agricole’s institutional structure was complete the  act also established the legal framework for crédit agricole’s operations in france local and regional banks did not emerge from the  crisis unscathed the caisse nationale took on a greater role and aided the most heavily exposed banks a joint deposit guarantee fund was set up in  the following year crédit agricole provided additional support by financing wheat stocks through discounting when the national cereals board onic was established the payment mechanisms used helped to make cheques and bank accounts more popular in the countryside between  and  the vichy regime imposed stricter state supervision on crédit agricole major financial developments also took place at this time including the creation of the fiveyear note postwar period and creation of fédération nationale du crédit agricole   edit to finance the postwar reconstruction effort and encourage the mechanisation of farming cnca stepped up deposittaking to supplement the funds provided by the government the regional banks opened many offices with the total increasing from  in  to  by  fédération nationale du crédit agricole fnca was created in  it was tasked with representing the crédit agricole regional banks with respect to the public authorities and cnca it also played a role in training staff and gradually expanding crédit agricole’s expertise in  crédit agricole was authorised by decree to finance property loans for primary residences in rural areas irrespective of the status of the owner even nonfarmers the distribution of longterm bonds created in  enabled crédit agricole to be selffinancing from  financial flows between the government and the organisation reversed with crédit agricole now sending deposits to the treasury crédit agricole continued to modernise with an influx of new managerial talent both in the regional banks and at cnca in  paul driant became the first chairman of cnca to come from a farming background he remained in this position for  years birth of a universal bank   edit in  as part of efforts to boost savings and remove crédit agricole from its budget the government gave cnca financial autonomy savings inflows no longer passed through the treasury and cnca was now responsible for balancing the surpluses and deficits of the regional banks the  rurality act extended crédit agricole’s potential financing sources to rural zones and to new types of customers such as craftsmen and food producers lending to smes and midtier firms followed after the banking reform of  allowed the organisation to offer households the same products as those provided by competitors including passbook accounts and home savings plans the first subsidiaries were set up at the end of the s to address the specific needs of cnca union d’études et d’investissements ui was created in  to make equity investments followed by segespar for asset management in  and unicrédit to grant loans to food producers in  crédit

sense close to home crédit agricole opened its first foreign branch in chicago in  signalling the start of its strategy of international expansion in that year the banker magazine ranked crédit agricole among the world’s leading banks reflecting this progress crédit agricole was made subject to france’s  banking act previously it had been subject only to the rural code in addition an interbank agreement was signed to make crédit agricole bank cards part of the carte bleue system used by other banks the group’s business diversification started in the s the predica life insurance subsidiary was set up in  while property  casualty unit pacifica was created in  the group expanded into bancassurance offering the first retirement savings plans at this time many local bank directors were also directors of groupama an insurer from the farming sector there was talk of a merger between the two but this did not ultimately come to pass institutional changes   edit on  january  the cnca privatisation act came into force cnca was transformed into a public limited company with a  stake sold to the regional banks and  to staff crédit agricole became fully independent of the government putting an end to the latter’s practice of skimming off surplus funds in  crédit agricole lost the monopoly on granting lowinterest loans to farmers and one year later in  the

french farmers struggled to obtain longterm flexible reasonablypriced credit there were several attempts to set up farming banks including crédit foncier de france in  but none was successful birth of crédit agricole and creation of the local and regional banks   edit jules méline spearheaded the creation of the first local banks crédit agricole can trace its history back to the end of the th century and specifically to the act of  establishing the freedom of professional association which authorised among other things the creation of farm unions and the foundation of local mutual banks société de crédit agricole was created on  february  at salinslesbains in the district of poligny in the jura region it was the first of its kind in france drawing on this experience and in an effort to promote lending to small family farms the act of  november  which had the support of minister for agriculture jules méline paved the way for the creation of crédit agricole’s local banks the first local banks were set up by local elites including agronomists teachers and property owners with farmers playing a minority role in the early years business was made up exclusively of shortterm loans provided as advances on harvests enabling farmers to live more comfortably mediumterm and longterm loans were added later making it possible to buy equipment and livestock the  act did not confer any financial advantages and the local banks soon faced financial problems such as a lack of capital and insufficient collateral from small farmers it was not until  that the government addressed these problems by requiring the banque de france to provide funding to crédit agricole through an endowment of  million gold francs and an annual fee of  million francs a year later the act of  resolved the collateral issues meanwhile the act of  march  instituted a commission within the ministry for agriculture to distribute the government advances between the regional banks which were also created at this time these cooperative entities brought together the local banks in their catchment area and acted as their clearing organisations building nationwide coverage   edit more and more local and regional banks were established from the turn of the century by the eve of the first world war every region had at least one but the government continued to provide threequarters of the funding and shortterm lending still accounted for the lion’s share of business despite the authorisation to issue longterm loans granted by the acts of  december  and  march  with some regions becoming isolated owing to the war the need for a central bank to regulate business became more apparent especially as crédit agricole was asked to provide financing to rebuild farming operations damaged during the conflict in the s the bank continued to build its nationwide coverage and expand its business activities notably by introducing loans to smallscale rural craftsmen in  financing rural electrification and financing local authorities in rural areas from  the act of  august  gave greater independence to what was at that time a credit department reporting directly to the ministry for agriculture and established a public central clearing organisation for the regional banks the office national de crédit agricole was thus set up with louis tardy as its chief executive officer in  the institution was renamed caisse nationale de crédit agricole cnca and crédit agricole’s institutional structure was complete the  act also established the legal framework for crédit agricole’s operations in france local and regional banks did not emerge from the  crisis unscathed the caisse nationale took on a greater role and aided the most heavily exposed banks a joint deposit guarantee fund was set up in  the following year crédit agricole provided additional support by financing wheat stocks through discounting when the national cereals board onic was established the payment mechanisms used helped to make cheques and bank accounts more popular in the countryside between  and  the vichy regime imposed stricter state supervision on crédit agricole major financial developments also took place at this time including the creation of the fiveyear note postwar period and creation of fédération nationale du crédit agricole   edit to finance the postwar reconstruction effort and encourage the mechanisation of farming cnca stepped up deposittaking to supplement the funds provided by the government the regional banks opened many offices with the total increasing from  in  to  by  fédération nationale du crédit agricole fnca was created in  it was tasked with representing the crédit agricole regional banks with respect to the public authorities and cnca it also played a role in training staff and gradually expanding crédit agricole’s expertise in  crédit agricole was authorised by decree to finance property loans for primary residences in rural areas irrespective of the status of the owner even nonfarmers the distribution of longterm bonds created in  enabled crédit agricole to be selffinancing from  financial flows between the government and the organisation reversed with crédit agricole now sending deposits to the treasury crédit agricole continued to modernise with an influx of new managerial talent both in the regional banks and at cnca in  paul driant became the first chairman of cnca to come from a farming background he remained in this position for  years birth of a universal bank   edit in  as part of efforts to boost savings and remove crédit agricole from its budget the government gave cnca financial autonomy savings inflows no longer passed through the treasury and cnca was now responsible for balancing the surpluses and deficits of the regional banks the  rurality act extended crédit agricole’s potential financing sources to rural zones and to new types of customers such as craftsmen and food producers lending to smes and midtier firms followed after the banking reform of  allowed the organisation to offer households the same products as those provided by competitors including passbook accounts and home savings plans the first subsidiaries were set up at the end of the s to address the specific needs of cnca union d’études et d’investissements ui was created in  to make equity investments followed by segespar for asset management in  and unicrédit to grant loans to food producers in  crédit agricole began distributing home purchase savings products from  governmentregulated mortgages from  and firsttimebuyer loans in  in  the group adopted the slogan le bon sens près de chez vous common sense close to home crédit agricole opened its first foreign branch in chicago in  signalling the start of its strategy of international expansion in that year the banker magazine ranked crédit agricole among the world’s leading banks reflecting this progress crédit agricole was made subject to france’s  banking act previously it had been subject only to the rural code in addition an interbank agreement was signed to make crédit agricole bank cards part of the carte bleue system used by other banks the group’s business diversification started in the s the predica life insurance subsidiary was set up in  while property  casualty unit pacifica was created in  the group expanded into bancassurance offering the first retirement savings plans at this time many local bank directors were also directors of groupama an insurer from the farming sector there was talk of a merger between the two but this did not ultimately come to pass institutional changes   edit on  january  the cnca privatisation act came into force cnca was transformed into a public limited company with a  stake sold to the regional banks and  to staff crédit agricole became fully independent of the government putting an end to the latter’s practice of skimming off surplus funds in  crédit agricole lost the monopoly on granting lowinterest loans to farmers and one year later in  the normalisation process was completed as it was allowed to begin financing large corporations international expansion continued with the acquisition of stakes in banco ambrosiano veneto in italy in  and banco espirito santo in portugal in  consolidation among the regional banks began officially in  with the aim of reducing costs the aim was to halve the number of regional banks and that objective had been surpassed by the turn of the st century meanwhile  of the  regional banks were listed on the secondary market through issues of cooperative investment certificates although most of the share capital of the regional banks remained in the hands of the  million client stakeholders in  lucien douroux who led the plan to privatise fnca became cnca’s first chief executive officer having been appointed by crédit agricole from existing staff in  the group bought indosuez and then created indocam an asset management

credit there were several attempts to set up farming banks including crédit foncier de france in  but none was successful birth of crédit agricole and creation of the local and regional banks   edit jules méline spearheaded the creation of the first local banks crédit agricole can trace its history back to the end of the th century and specifically to the act of  establishing the freedom of professional association which authorised among other things the creation of farm unions and the foundation of local mutual banks société de crédit agricole was created on  february  at salinslesbains in the district of poligny in the jura region it was the first of its kind in france drawing on this experience and in an effort to promote lending to small family farms the act of  november  which had the support of minister for agriculture jules méline paved the way for the creation of crédit agricole’s local banks the first local banks were set up by local elites including agronomists teachers and property owners with farmers playing a minority role in the early years business was made up exclusively of shortterm loans provided as advances on harvests enabling farmers to live more comfortably mediumterm and longterm loans were added later making it possible to buy equipment and livestock the  act did not confer any financial advantages and the local banks soon faced financial problems such as a lack of capital and insufficient collateral from small farmers it was not until  that the government addressed these problems by requiring the banque de france to provide funding to crédit agricole through an endowment of  million gold francs and an annual fee of  million francs a year later the act of  resolved the collateral issues meanwhile the act of  march  instituted a commission within the ministry for agriculture to distribute the government advances between the regional banks which were also created at this time these cooperative entities brought together the local banks in their catchment area and acted as their clearing organisations building nationwide coverage   edit more and more local and regional banks were established from the turn of the century by the eve of the first world war every region had at least one but the government continued to provide threequarters of the funding and shortterm lending still accounted for the lion’s share of business despite the authorisation to issue longterm loans granted by the acts of  december  and  march  with some regions becoming isolated owing to the war the need for a central bank to regulate business became more apparent especially as crédit agricole was asked to provide financing to rebuild farming operations damaged during the conflict in the s the bank continued to build its nationwide coverage and expand its business activities notably by introducing loans to smallscale rural craftsmen in  financing rural electrification and financing local authorities in rural areas from  the act of  august  gave greater independence to what was at that time a credit department reporting directly to the ministry for agriculture and established a public central clearing organisation for the regional banks the office national de crédit agricole was thus set up with louis tardy as its chief executive officer in  the institution was renamed caisse nationale de crédit agricole cnca and crédit agricole’s institutional structure was complete the  act also established the legal framework for crédit agricole’s operations in france local and regional banks did not emerge from the  crisis unscathed the caisse nationale took on a greater role and aided the most heavily exposed banks a joint deposit guarantee fund was set up in  the following year crédit agricole provided additional support by financing wheat stocks through discounting when the national cereals board onic was established the payment mechanisms used helped to make cheques and bank accounts more popular in the countryside between  and  the vichy regime imposed stricter state supervision on crédit agricole major financial developments also took place at this time including the creation of the fiveyear note postwar period and creation of fédération nationale du crédit agricole   edit to finance the postwar reconstruction effort and encourage the mechanisation of farming cnca stepped up deposittaking to supplement the funds provided by the government the regional banks opened many offices with the total increasing from  in  to  by  fédération nationale du crédit agricole fnca was created in  it was tasked with representing the crédit agricole regional banks with respect to the public authorities and cnca it also played a role in training staff and gradually expanding crédit agricole’s expertise in  crédit agricole was authorised by decree to finance property loans for primary residences in rural areas irrespective of the status of the owner even nonfarmers the distribution of longterm bonds created in  enabled crédit agricole to be selffinancing from  financial flows between the government and the organisation reversed with crédit agricole now sending deposits to the treasury crédit agricole continued to modernise with an influx of new managerial talent both in the regional banks and at cnca in  paul driant became the first chairman of cnca to come from a farming background he remained in this position for  years birth of a universal bank   edit in  as part of efforts to boost savings and remove crédit agricole from its budget the government gave cnca financial autonomy savings inflows no longer passed through the treasury and cnca was now responsible for balancing the surpluses and deficits of the regional banks the  rurality act extended crédit agricole’s potential financing sources to rural zones and to new types of customers such as craftsmen and food producers lending to smes and midtier firms followed after the banking reform of  allowed the organisation to offer households the same products as those provided by competitors including passbook accounts and home savings plans the first subsidiaries were set up at the end of the s to address the specific needs of cnca union d’études et d’investissements ui was created in  to make equity investments followed by segespar for asset management in  and unicrédit to grant loans to food producers in  crédit

sense close to home crédit agricole opened its first foreign branch in chicago in  signalling the start of its strategy of international expansion in that year the banker magazine ranked crédit agricole among the world’s leading banks reflecting this progress crédit agricole was made subject to france’s  banking act previously it had been subject only to the rural code in addition an interbank agreement was signed to make crédit agricole bank cards part of the carte bleue system used by other banks the group’s business diversification started in the s the predica life insurance subsidiary was set up in  while property  casualty unit pacifica was created in  the group expanded into bancassurance offering the first retirement savings plans at this time many local bank directors were also directors of groupama an insurer from the farming sector there was talk of a merger between the two but this did not ultimately come to pass institutional changes   edit on  january  the cnca privatisation act came into force cnca was transformed into a public limited company with a  stake sold to the regional banks and  to staff crédit agricole became fully independent of the government putting an end to the latter’s practice of skimming off surplus funds in  crédit agricole lost the monopoly on granting lowinterest loans to farmers and one year later in  the normalisation process was completed as it was allowed to begin financing large corporations international expansion continued with the acquisition of stakes in banco ambrosiano veneto in italy in  and banco espirito santo in portugal in  consolidation among the regional banks began officially in  with the aim of reducing costs the aim was to halve the number of regional banks and that objective had been surpassed by the turn of the st century meanwhile  of the  regional banks were listed on the secondary market through issues of cooperative investment certificates although most of the share capital of the regional banks remained in the hands of the  million client stakeholders in  lucien douroux who led the plan to privatise fnca became cnca’s first chief executive officer having been
