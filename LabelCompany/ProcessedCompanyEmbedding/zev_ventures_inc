offering of the notes and you should not rely upon this product supplement the term sheet or the accompanying prospectus or prospectus supplement as investment advice or a recommendation to purchase the notes listing    unless otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet the notes will not be listed on a securities exchange or quotation system this product supplement relates only to the notes and does not relate to any underlying stock described in any term sheet you should read carefully the entire prospectus prospectus supplement and product supplement together with the applicable term sheet to understand fully the terms of your notes as well as the tax and other considerations important to you in making a decision about whether to invest in any notes in particular you should review carefully the section in this product supplement entitled risk factors which highlights a number of risks of an investment in the notes to determine whether an investment in the notes is appropriate for you if information in this product supplement is inconsistent with the prospectus or prospectus supplement this product supplement will supersede those documents however if information in any term sheet is inconsistent with this product supplement that term sheet will supersede this product supplement for example we may offer notes in which the step up payment will be paid if the ending value equals or exceeds the threshold value you should carefully review the applicable term sheet to understand the specific terms of your notes neither we nor any selling agent is making an offer to sell the notes in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted certain capitalized terms used and not defined in this product supplement have the meanings ascribed to them in the prospectus supplement and prospectus unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise all references in this product supplement to we us our or similar references are to bank of america corporation you are urged to consult with your own attorneys and business and tax advisors before making a decision to purchase any notes     ps   table of contents risk factors your investment in the notes is subject to investment risks many of which differ from those of a conventional debt security your decision to purchase the notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks including those discussed below in light of your particular circumstances the notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about the material terms of the notes or investments in equity or equitybased securities in general general risks relating to the notes your investment may result in a loss there is no guaranteed return of principal there is no fixed principal repayment amount on the notes at maturity the return on the notes will be based on the performance of the market measure and therefore you may lose all or a significant portion of your investment if the value of the market measure decreases from the starting value to an ending value that is less than the threshold value if the ending value is less than the threshold value then you will receive a redemption amount at maturity that will be less than the principal amount of your notes and if the threshold value is equal to  of the starting value the redemption amount could be zero your return on the notes may be less than the yield on a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity there will be no periodic interest payments on the notes as there would be on a conventional fixedrate or floatingrate debt security having the same maturity any return that you receive on the notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same maturity date as a result your investment in the notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you consider factors such as inflation that affect the time value of money your investment return is limited to the return represented by the call premium if applicable and may be less than a comparable investment directly in the market measure if the notes are subject to an automatic call and if the observation level of the market measure on an observation date is equal to or greater than the specified call level we will automatically call the notes if the notes are automatically called your return will be limited to the applicable call premium regardless of the extent of the increase in the value of the market measure in addition unless otherwise set forth in the applicable term sheet and this product supplement under description of the notesantidilution adjustments the ending value and the observation levels if applicable will not reflect the value of dividends paid or distributions made on an underlying stock or any other rights associated with an underlying stock your return on the notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of an underlying stock reinvestment risk  if the notes are subject to an automatic call and are automatically called prior to maturity the term of the notes will be shorter there is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the notes at a comparable return for a similar level of risk in the event the notes are called prior to maturity payments on the notes are subject to our credit risk and actual or perceived changes in our creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the notes the notes are our senior unsecured debt securities as a result your receipt of any payments on the notes is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment date regardless of whether the market measure increases from the starting value to the ending value or the observation level if applicable no assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be on the applicable payment date if we become unable to meet our   ps table of contents financial obligations as they become due you may not receive the amounts payable under the terms of the notes in addition our credit ratings are an assessment by ratings agencies of our ability to pay our obligations consequently our perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our credit ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our securities and the yield on us treasury securities the  credit spread  prior to the maturity date may adversely affect the market value of the notes however because your return on the notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability to pay our obligations such as the value of the market measure an improvement in our credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the notes the initial estimated value of the notes considers certain assumptions and variables and relies in part on certain forecasts about future events which may prove to be incorrect the initial estimated value of the notes which will be set forth in the applicable term sheet is an estimate only determined as of a particular point in time by reference to our and our affiliates pricing models these pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables including our credit spreads our internal funding rate on the pricing date midmarket terms on hedging transactions expectations on interest rates and volatility pricesensitivity analysis and the expected term of the notes these pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events which may prove to be incorrect the public offering price you pay for the notes will exceed the initial estimated value if you attempt to sell the notes prior to maturity their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than the initial estimated value this is due to among other things changes in the value of the market measure our internal funding rate and the inclusion in the public offering price of the underwriting discount and an expected hedging related charge these factors together with various credit market and economic factors over the term of the notes are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the notes in complex and unpredictable ways the initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we mlpfs or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase your notes in any secondary market if any exists at any time the value of your notes at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy including the performance of the market measure our creditworthiness and changes in market conditions we cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for your notes if a secondary market exists we cannot predict how the notes will trade or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid the development of a trading market for the notes will depend on various factors including our financial performance and changes in the value of the market measure the number of potential buyers of your notes in any secondary market may be limited there is no assurance that any party will be willing to purchase your notes at any price in any secondary market we anticipate that one or more of the selling agents will act as a marketmaker for the notes that it offers but none of them is required to do so and may cease to do so at any time any price at which a selling agent may bid for offer purchase or sell any of the notes may be higher or lower than the applicable public offering price and that price may differ from the values determined by pricing models that it may use whether as a result of dealer discounts markups or other transaction costs these bids offers or transactions may affect the prices if any at which the notes might otherwise trade in the market in addition if at any time any   ps table of contents selling agent were to cease acting as a marketmaker for any issue of the notes it is likely that there would be significantly less liquidity in that secondary market in such a case the price at which those notes could be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed unless otherwise stated in the term sheet we will not list the notes on any securities exchange even if an application were made to list your notes we cannot assure you that the application will be approved or that your notes will be listed and if listed that they will remain listed for their entire term the listing of the notes on any securities exchange will not necessarily ensure that a trading market will develop and if a trading market does develop that there will be liquidity in the trading market payments on the notes will not reflect changes in the value of the market measure other than on the calculation day or the observation dates if applicable changes in the value of the market measure during the term of the notes other than on the calculation day or the observation dates if applicable will not be reflected in the calculation of the amount payable on the notes to make that calculation the calculation agent will refer only to the value of the market measure on the calculation day or the observation dates if applicable no other values of the market measure will be taken into account as a result even if the value of the market measure has increased at certain times during the term of the notes your notes will not be called if applicable if the observation level on each observation date is less than the call level and you will receive a redemption amount that is less than the principal amount if the ending value is less than the threshold value if your notes are linked to a basket changes in the prices of one or more of the basket stocks may be offset by changes in the prices of one or more of the other basket stocks the market measure of your notes may be a basket in such a case changes in the prices of one or more of the basket stocks may not correlate with changes in the prices of one or more of the other basket stocks the prices of one or more basket stocks may increase while the prices of one or more of the other basket stocks may decrease or not increase as much therefore in calculating the value of the market measure at any time increases in the price of one basket stock may be moderated or wholly offset by decreases or lesser increases in the prices of one or more of the other basket stocks if the weightings of the applicable basket stocks are not equal adverse changes in the prices of the basket stocks which are more heavily weighted could have a greater impact upon your notes if you attempt to sell the notes prior to maturity their market value if any will be affected by various factors that interrelate in complex ways and their market value may be less than the principal amount the limited protection against the risk of losses provided by the threshold value if any will only apply if you hold the notes to maturity you have no right to have your notes redeemed at your option prior to maturity if you wish to liquidate your investment in the notes prior to maturity your only option would be to sell them at that time there may be an illiquid market for your notes or no market at all even if you were able to sell your notes there are many factors outside of our control that may affect their market value some of which but not all are stated below the impact of any one factor may be offset or magnified by the effect of another factor the following paragraphs describe a specific factors expected impact on the market value of the notes assuming all other conditions remain constant        value of the market measure we anticipate that the market value of the notes prior to maturity generally will depend to a significant extent on the value of the market measure in general it is expected that the market value of the notes will decrease as the value of the market measure decreases and increase as the value of the market measure increases however as the value of the market measure increases or decreases the   ps table of contents   market value of the notes is not expected to increase or decrease at the same rate if you sell your notes when the value of the market measure is less than or not sufficiently above the starting value then you may receive less than the principal amount of your notes in addition if the notes are subject to an automatic call because the amount payable on the notes upon an automatic call will not exceed the applicable call amount we do not expect that the notes will trade in any secondary market prior to any observation date at a price that is greater than the applicable call amount        volatility of the market measure volatility is the term used to describe the size and frequency of market fluctuations increases or decreases in the volatility of the market measure may have an adverse impact on the market value of the notes even if the value of the market measure increases after the applicable pricing date if you are able to sell your notes before their maturity date you may receive substantially less than the amount that would be payable on any call settlement date if applicable or at maturity based on that value because of the anticipation that the value of the market measure will continue to fluctuate until the calculation day        economic and other conditions generally the general economic conditions of the capital markets in the united states as well as geopolitical conditions and other financial political regulatory and judicial events and related uncertainties that affect stock markets generally may affect the value of the market measure and the market value of the notes        interest rates we expect that changes in interest rates will affect the market value of the notes in general if us interest rates increase we expect that the market value of the notes will decrease and conversely if us interest rates decrease we expect that the market value of the notes will increase in general we expect that the longer the amount of time that remains until maturity the more significant the impact of these changes will be on the value of the notes the level of interest rates also may affect the us economy and any applicable market outside of the us and in turn the value of the market measure and thus the market value of the notes may be adversely affected if any underlying stock is an adr the level of interest rates in the relevant foreign country may affect the economy of that foreign country and in turn the value of the adr and thus the market value of the notes may be adversely affected        dividend yields in general if the cumulative dividend yield on any underlying stock increases we anticipate that the market value of the notes will decrease conversely if that dividend yield decreases we anticipate that the market value of your notes will increase        our financial condition and creditworthiness our perceived creditworthiness including any increases in our credit spreads and any actual or anticipated decreases in our credit ratings may adversely affect the market value of the notes in general we expect the longer the amount of time that remains until maturity the more significant the impact will be on the value of the notes however a decrease in our credit spreads or an improvement in our credit ratings will not necessarily increase the market value of the notes        time to maturity or if applicable next observation date there may be a disparity between the market value of the notes prior to maturity or if applicable prior to an   ps table of contents   observation date and their value at maturity or as of the next observation date if applicable this disparity is often called a time value premium or discount and reflects expectations concerning the value of the market measure during the term of the notes as the time to maturity or if applicable the next observation date decreases this disparity may decrease such that the value of the notes will approach the expected redemption amount to be paid at maturity or if applicable the call amount to be paid at the next call settlement date trading and hedging activities by us and our affiliates may affect your return on the notes and their market value we and our affiliates including the selling agents may buy or sell shares of any underlying stock futures or options contracts on any underlying stock or other listed or overthe counter derivative instruments linked to any underlying stock we may execute such purchases or sales for our own accounts for business reasons or in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes these transactions could affect the value of an underlying stock in a manner that could be adverse to your investment in the notes on or before the applicable pricing date any purchases by us our affiliates or others on our behalf may increase the value of an underlying stock consequently the value of that underlying stock may decrease subsequent to the pricing date of an issue of the notes adversely affect the market value of the notes we or one or more of our affiliates including the selling agents may also engage in hedging activities that could increase the value of the market measure on the applicable pricing date in addition these activities may decrease the market value of your notes prior to maturity including on the calculation day or if applicable on each observation date and may adversely affect the payments on the notes we or one or more of our affiliates including the selling agents may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short position in the notes and may hold or resell the notes for example the selling agents may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which they engage we cannot assure you that these activities will not adversely affect the value of the market measure the market value of your notes prior to maturity or the payments on the notes our trading hedging and other business activities may create conflicts of interest with you we or one or more of our affiliates including the selling agents may engage in trading activities related to an underlying stock that are not for your account or on your behalf we or one or more of our affiliates including the selling agents also may issue or underwrite other financial instruments with returns based upon the applicable underlying stock these trading and other business activities may present a conflict of interest between your interest in the notes and the interests we and our affiliates including the selling agents may have in our proprietary accounts in facilitating transactions including block trades for our or their other customers and in accounts under our or their management these trading and other business activities if they influence the value of the market measure or secondary trading in your notes could be adverse to your interests as a beneficial owner of the notes we expect to enter into arrangements or adjust or close out existing transactions to hedge our obligations under the notes we or our affiliates also may enter into hedging transactions relating to other notes or instruments that we issue some of which may have returns calculated in a manner related to that of a particular issue of the notes we may enter into such hedging arrangements with one of our subsidiaries or affiliates such a party may enter into additional hedging transactions with other parties relating to the notes and the applicable underlying stock this hedging activity is expected to result in a profit to those engaging in the hedging activity which could be more or less than initially expected or the hedging activity could also result in a loss we or our affiliates will price these hedging transactions with the intent to realize a profit regardless of whether the value of the notes   ps table of contents increases or decreases any profit in connection with such hedging activities will be in addition to any other compensation that we and our affiliates including the selling agents receive for the sale of the notes which creates an additional incentive to sell the notes to you there may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent we have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent one of our affiliates will be the calculation agent for the notes and as such will determine the starting value the step up value the threshold value the ending value the redemption amount and if applicable the call level and each observation level and whether the notes will be called under some circumstances these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent these conflicts could occur for instance in connection with the calculation agents determination as to whether a market disruption event has occurred or in connection with judgments that it would be required to make if certain corporate events occur with respect to any underlying stock see the sections entitled description of the notesmarket disruption events and antidilution adjustments the calculation agent will be required to carry out its duties in good faith and use its reasonable judgment however because we expect to control the calculation agent potential conflicts of interest could arise the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes are uncertain and may be adverse to a holder of the notes no statutory judicial or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the notes or securities similar to the notes for us federal income tax purposes as a result significant aspects of the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes are not certain under the terms of the notes you will have agreed with us to treat the notes as single financial contracts as described under us federal income tax summarygeneral if the internal revenue service the irs were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the notes the timing and character of gain or loss with respect to the notes may differ no ruling will be requested from the irs with respect to the notes and no assurance can be given that the irs will agree with the statements made in the section entitled us federal income tax summary you are urged to consult with your own tax advisor regarding all aspects of the us federal income tax consequences of investing in the notes risks relating to an underlying stock you must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment linked to any applicable underlying stock in the ordinary course of business our affiliates may have expressed views on expected movements in an underlying stock and may do so in the future these views or reports may be communicated to our clients and clients of our affiliates however these views are subject to change from time to time moreover other professionals who deal in markets relating to an underlying stock may at any time have significantly different views from those of our affiliates for these reasons you are encouraged to derive information concerning an underlying stock from multiple sources and you should not rely on the views expressed by our affiliates you will have no rights as a security holder you will have no rights to receive any shares of any underlying stock and you will not be entitled to dividends or other distributions by any underlying company the notes are our debt securities they are not equity instruments shares of stock or securities of any other issuer investing in the notes will not make you a holder of any underlying stock you will not have any voting rights any rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to any underlying stock as a result the return on your notes may not reflect the return you would   ps table of contents realize if you actually owned shares of any underlying stock and received the dividends paid or other distributions made in connection with them your notes will be paid in cash and you have no right to receive delivery of shares of any underlying stock if shares of an underlying company are also listed on a foreign exchange your return may be affected by factors affecting international securities markets the value of securities traded outside of the us may be adversely affected by a variety of factors relating to the relevant securities markets factors which could affect those markets and therefore the return on your notes include        market volatility the relevant foreign securities markets may be more volatile than us or other securities markets and may be affected by market developments in different ways than us or other securities markets        political economic and other factors the prices and performance of securities of companies in foreign countries may be affected by political economic financial and social factors in those regions direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize a particular securities market and crossshareholdings in companies in the relevant foreign markets may affect prices and the volume of trading in those markets in addition recent or future changes in government economic and fiscal policies in the relevant jurisdictions the possible imposition of or changes in currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions and possible fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies are factors that could negatively affect the relevant securities markets the relevant foreign economies may differ from the us economy in economic factors such as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resources and selfsufficiency in particular many emerging nations are undergoing rapid change involving the restructuring of economic political financial and legal systems regulatory and tax environments may be subject to change without review or appeal and many emerging markets suffer from underdevelopment of capital markets and tax systems in addition in some of these nations issuers of the relevant securities face the threat of expropriation of their assets andor nationalization of their businesses the economic and financial data about some of these countries may be unreliable we do not control any underlying company and have not verified any disclosure made by any underlying company we or our affiliates currently or in the future may engage in business with any underlying company and we or our affiliates may from time to time own securities of any underlying company however neither we nor any of our affiliates including the selling agents have the ability to control any actions of any underlying company or have undertaken any independent review of or made any due diligence inquiry with respect to any underlying company you should make your own investigation into any underlying stock our business activities relating to any underlying company may create conflicts of interest with you we and our affiliates including the selling agents at the time of any offering of the notes or in the future may engage in business with any underlying company including making loans to equity investments in or providing investment banking asset management or other services to that company its affiliates and its competitors in connection with these activities we or our affiliates may receive information about those companies that we will not divulge to you or other third parties one or more of our affiliates have published and in the future may publish research reports on one or more of   ps table of contents these companies this research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding your notes any of these activities may affect the value of the market measure and consequently the market value of your notes we or any of our affiliates do not make any representation to any purchasers of the notes regarding any matters whatsoever relating to any underlying company any prospective purchaser of the notes should undertake an independent investigation of any underlying company to a level that in its judgment is appropriate to make an informed decision regarding an investment in the notes the selection of an underlying stock does not reflect any investment recommendations from us or our affiliates an underlying company will have no obligations relating to the notes and we will not perform any due diligence procedures with respect to any underlying company an underlying company will not have any financial or legal obligation with respect to the notes or the amounts to be paid to you including any obligation to take our needs or the needs of noteholders into consideration for any reason including taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of an underlying stock or the value of the notes an underlying company will not receive any of the proceeds from any offering of the notes and will not be responsible for or participate in the offering of the notes no underlying company will be responsible for or participate in the determination or calculation of the amount receivable by holders of the notes neither we nor any selling agent will conduct any due diligence inquiry with respect to any underlying stock in connection with an offering of the notes neither we nor any selling agent has made any independent investigation as to the completeness or accuracy of publicly available information regarding any underlying company or as to the future performance of any underlying stock any prospective purchaser of the notes should undertake such independent investigation of any underlying company as in its judgment is appropriate to make an informed decision with respect to an investment in the notes the payment on the notes will not be adjusted for all corporate events that could affect an underlying company the price multiplier the relevant observation level if applicable the ending value the payment on the notes and other terms of the notes may be adjusted for the specified corporate events affecting any underlying stock as described in the section entitled description of the notesantidilution adjustments however these adjustments do not cover all corporate events that could affect the market price of an underlying stock such as offerings of common shares for cash or in connection with certain acquisition transactions the occurrence of any event that does not require the calculation agent to adjust the applicable price multiplier or the amount paid to you on the notes may adversely affect the closing market price of an underlying stock an observation level if applicable the ending value and the payment on the notes and as a result the market value of the notes risks relating to underlying stocks that are adrs the value of an adr may not accurately track the value of the common shares of the related underlying company if an underlying stock is an adr each adr will represent shares of the relevant underlying company generally the adrs are issued under a deposit agreement that sets forth the rights and responsibilities of the depositary the underlying company and the holders of the adrs the trading patterns of the adrs will generally reflect the characteristics and valuations of the underlying common shares however the value of the adrs may not completely track the value of those shares there are important differences between the rights of holders of adrs and the rights of holders of the underlying common shares in addition trading volume and pricing on the applicable nonus exchange may but   ps table of contents will not necessarily have similar characteristics as the adrs for example certain factors may increase or decrease the public float of the adrs and as a result the adrs may have less liquidity or lower market value than the underlying common shares exchange rate movements may adversely impact the value of an underlying stock that is an adr if an underlying stock is an adr the market price of the underlying stock will generally track the us dollar value of the market price of the underlying common shares therefore if the value of the related foreign currency in which the underlying common shares are traded decreases relative to the us dollar the market price of the underlying stock may decrease while the market price of the underlying common shares remains stable or increases or does not decrease to the same extent as a result changes in and the volatility of the exchange rates between the us dollar and the relevant nonus currency could have a negative impact on the value of the underlying stock and consequently the value of your notes and the amount payable on the notes adverse trading conditions in the applicable nonus market may negatively affect the value of an underlying stock that is an adr holders of an underlying companys adrs may usually surrender the adrs in order to receive and trade the underlying common shares this provision permits investors in the adrs to take advantage of price differentials between markets however this provision may also cause the market prices of the applicable underlying stock to more closely correspond with the values of the common shares in the applicable nonus markets as a result a market outside of the united states for the underlying common shares that is not liquid may also result in an illiquid market for the adrs which may negatively impact the value of such adrs and consequently the value of your notes delisting of an underlying stock that is an adr may adversely affect the value of the notes if an underlying stock that is an adr is no longer listed or admitted to trading on a us securities exchange registered under the exchange act or included in the otc bulletin board service operated by the financial industry regulatory authority inc  finra  or if the adr facility between the underlying company and the adr depositary is terminated for any reason the market measure for the notes will be deemed to be the underlying companys common equity securities rather than the adrs and the calculation agent will determine the price of the market measure by reference to those common shares as described below under description of the notesdelisting of adrs or termination of adr facility replacing the original adrs with the underlying common shares may adversely affect the value of the notes and the payment on the notes other risk factors relating to an underlying stock the applicable term sheet may set forth additional risk factors as to an underlying stock that you should review prior to purchasing the notes   ps table of contents use of proceeds we will use the net proceeds we receive from each sale of the notes for the purposes described in the accompanying prospectus under use of proceeds in addition we expect that we or our affiliates may use a portion of the net proceeds to hedge our obligations under the notes   ps table of contents description of the notes general each issue of the notes will be part of a series of mediumterm notes entitled

agent in its sole discretion and as it deems reasonable may adjust the price multiplier and other terms of the notes and hence the ending value and if applicable an observation level as a result of certain events related to an underlying stock which include but are not limited to the following stock splits and reverse stock splits if an underlying stock is subject to a stock split or reverse stock split then once such split has become effective the price multiplier will be adjusted such that the new price multiplier will equal the product of        the prior price multiplier and        the number of shares that a holder of one share of the underlying stock before the effective date of the stock split or reverse stock split would have owned immediately following the applicable effective date for example a twoforone stock split would ordinarily change a price multiplier of one into a price multiplier of two in contrast a onefortwo reverse stock split would ordinarily change a price multiplier of one into a price multiplier of onehalf stock dividends if an underlying stock is subject to i a stock dividend ie an issuance of additional shares of underlying stock that is given ratably to all holders of the underlying stock or ii a distribution of additional shares of the underlying stock as a result of the triggering of any provision of the organizational documents of the underlying company then once the dividend has become effective and the underlying stock is trading exdividend the price multiplier will be adjusted on the exdividend date such that the new price multiplier will equal the prior price multiplier plus the product of        the prior price multiplier and        the number of additional shares issued in the stock dividend with respect to one share of the underlying stock provided that no adjustment will be made for a stock dividend for which the number of shares of the underlying stock paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value unless such distribution is an extraordinary dividend as defined below for example a stock dividend of one new share for each share held would ordinarily change a price multiplier of one into a price multiplier of two extraordinary dividends there will be no adjustments to the price multiplier to reflect any cash dividends or cash distributions paid with respect to an underlying stock other than extraordinary dividends as described below and distributions described under the section entitled reorganization events below   ps table of contents an  extraordinary dividend  means with respect to a cash dividend or other distribution with respect to an underlying stock a dividend or other distribution that the calculation agent determines in its sole discretion is not declared or otherwise made according to the underlying companys then existing policy or practice of paying such dividends on a quarterly or other regular basis if an extraordinary dividend occurs the price multiplier will be adjusted on the exdividend date so that the new price multiplier will equal the product of        the prior price multiplier and        a fraction the numerator of which is the closing market price per share of the underlying stock on the trading day preceding the exdividend date and the denominator of which is the amount by which the closing market price per share of the underlying stock on that preceding trading day exceeds the extraordinary dividend amount the  extraordinary dividend amount  with respect to an extraordinary dividend will equal        in the case of cash dividends or other distributions that constitute regular dividends the amount per share of the underlying stock of that extraordinary dividend minus the amount per share of the immediately preceding nonextraordinary dividend for that share or        in the case of cash dividends or other distributions that do not constitute regular dividends the amount per share of the underlying stock of that extraordinary dividend to the extent an extraordinary dividend is not paid in cash the value of the noncash component will be determined by the calculation agent whose determination will be conclusive a distribution on the underlying stock described in the section issuance of transferable rights or warrants or clause a d or e of the section entitled reorganization events below that also constitutes an extraordinary dividend will only cause an adjustment under those respective sections issuance of transferable rights or warrants if an underlying company issues transferable rights or warrants to all holders of record of the underlying stock to subscribe for or purchase the underlying stock including new or existing rights to purchase the underlying stock under a shareholder rights plan or arrangement then the price multiplier will be adjusted on the trading day immediately following the issuance of those transferable rights or warrants so that the new price multiplier will equal the prior price multiplier plus the product of        the prior price multiplier and        the number of shares of the underlying stock that can be purchased with the cash value of those warrants or rights distributed on one share of the underlying stock   ps table of contents the number of shares that can be purchased will be based on the closing market price of the underlying stock on the date the new price multiplier is determined the cash value of those warrants or rights if the warrants or rights are traded on a registered national securities exchange will equal the closing price of that warrant or right if the warrants or rights are not traded on a registered national securities exchange the cash value will be determined by the calculation agent and will equal the average of the bid prices obtained from three dealers at  pm new york time on the date the new price multiplier is determined provided that if only two of those bid prices are available then the cash value of those warrants or rights will equal the average of those bids and if only one of those bids is available then the cash value of those

starting value and if applicable the call level that will reflect the adjustments to the extent practicable made by the options clearing corporation on options contracts on an underlying stock or any successor common stock for example if the underlying stock is subject to a twoforone stock split and the options clearing corporation adjusts the strike prices of the options contract on the underlying stock by dividing the strike price by two then the calculation agent may also elect to divide the starting value by two in this case the price multiplier will remain one this adjustment would have the same economic effect on holders of the notes as if the price multiplier had been adjusted antidilution adjustments to underlying stocks that are adrs for purposes of the antidilution adjustments set forth above if an underlying stock is an adr an  underlying adr  the calculation agent will consider the effect of any of the relevant events on the underlying adr and adjustments will be made as if the underlying adr was the underlying stock described above for example if the stock represented by the underlying adr is subject to a twoforone stock split and assuming an initial price multiplier of  the price multiplier for the underlying adr would be adjusted so that it equals two unless otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet with respect to the notes linked to an

adjustments as set forth above if the notes had been linked directly to the common shares of the underlying company represented by the underlying adr or     b to the extent that the calculation agent determines that the underlying company or the depositary for the adrs has adjusted the number of common shares of the underlying company represented by each share of the underlying adr so that the market price of the underlying adr would not be affected by the corporate event if the underlying company or the depositary for the adrs in the absence of any of the events described above elects to

noted will purchase the notes upon original issuance and will hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of section  of the code which generally means property held for investment and that are not excluded from the discussion under us federal income tax considerations in the accompanying prospectus you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the us federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring owning and disposing of the notes as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local foreign or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in us federal or other tax laws general although there is no statutory judicial or administrative authority directly addressing the characterization of the notes we intend to treat the notes for all tax purposes as single financial contracts with respect to the market measure and under the terms of the notes we and every investor in the notes agree in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary to treat the notes in accordance with such characterization this discussion assumes that the notes constitute single financial contracts with respect to the market measure for us federal income tax purposes if the notes did not constitute single financial contracts the tax consequences described below would be materially different this characterization of the notes is not binding on the irs or the courts no statutory judicial or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the notes or any similar instruments for us federal income tax purposes and no ruling is being requested from the irs with respect to their proper characterization and treatment due to the absence of authorities on point significant aspects of the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes are not certain and no assurance can be given that the irs or any court will agree with the characterization and tax treatment described in this product supplement accordingly you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the us federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes including possible alternative characterizations   ps table of contents unless otherwise stated the following discussion is based on the characterization described above the discussion in this section assumes that there is a significant possibility of a significant loss of principal on an investment in the notes we will not attempt to ascertain whether the issuer of any underlying stock would be treated as a passive foreign investment company  pfic  within the meaning of section  of the code or a united states real property holding corporation within the meaning of section c of the code if the issuer of any underlying stock were so treated certain adverse us federal income tax consequences could possibly apply to a holder of the notes you should refer to information filed with the sec by the issuer of any underlying stock and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you if any if the issuer of any underlying stock is or becomes a pfic or is or becomes a united states real property holding corporation us holders upon receipt of a cash payment at maturity or upon a sale call or exchange of the notes prior to maturity a us holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the us holders tax basis in the notes a us holders tax basis in the notes will equal the amount paid by that holder to acquire them this capital gain or loss generally will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder held the notes for more than one year the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations alternative tax treatments  due to the absence of authorities that directly address the proper tax treatment of the notes prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding all possible alternative tax treatments of an investment in the notes in particular if the notes have a term that exceeds one year the irs could seek to subject the notes to the treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments if the irs were successful in that regard the timing and character of income on the notes would be affected significantly among other things a us holder would be required to accrue original issue discount every year at a comparable yield determined at the time of issuance in addition any gain realized by a us holder at maturity or upon a sale call or exchange of the notes generally would be treated as ordinary income and any loss realized at maturity would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the us holders prior accruals of original issue discount and as capital loss thereafter if the notes have a term of one year or less a us holder who uses the accrual method of accounting generally should be required to accrue any original issue discount on the notes on a straightline basis at maturity or upon a sale call or exchange a us holder using either a cash or accrual method of accounting generally should recognize taxable gain all or a portion of which may be treated as ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and such holders tax basis in the notes the irs released notice   notice  which sought comments from the public on the taxation of financial instruments currently taxed as prepaid forward contracts this notice addresses instruments such as the notes according to the notice the irs and treasury are considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the notes should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis regardless of whether any payments are made prior to maturity it is not possible to determine what guidance the irs and treasury will ultimately issue if any any such future guidance may affect the amount timing and character of income gain or loss in respect of the notes possibly with retroactive effect the irs and treasury are also considering additional issues including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital whether   ps table of contents foreign holders of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals whether section  of the code concerning certain constructive ownership transactions generally applies or should generally apply to such instruments and whether any of these determinations depend on the nature of the underlying asset in addition proposed treasury regulations require the accrual of income on a current basis for contingent payments made under certain notional principal contracts the preamble to the regulations states that the wait and see method of accounting does not properly reflect the economic accrual of income on those contracts and requires current accrual of income for some contracts already in existence while the proposed regulations do not apply to prepaid forward contracts the preamble to the proposed regulations expresses the view that similar timing issues exist in the case of prepaid forward contracts if the irs or treasury publishes future guidance requiring current economic accrual for contingent payments on prepaid forward contracts it is possible that you could be required to accrue income over the term of the notes because of the absence of authority regarding the appropriate tax characterization of the notes it is also possible that the irs could seek to characterize the notes in a manner that results in tax consequences that are different from those described above for example the irs could possibly assert that any gain or loss that a holder may recognize at maturity or upon sale or exchange of the notes should be treated as ordinary it is possible that the irs could assert that a us holders holding period in respect of the notes should end on the applicable calculation day even though such holder will not receive any amounts in respect of the notes prior to the redemption or maturity of the notes in such case if the applicable calculation day is not in excess of one year from the original issue date a us holder may be treated as having a holding period in respect of the notes equal to one year or less in which case any gain or loss such holder recognizes at such time would be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss nonus holders a nonus holder generally will not be subject to us federal income or withholding tax on any gain from the sale or exchange or the notes or their settlement at maturity provided that the nonus holder complies with applicable certification requirements and that the payment is not effectively connected with the conduct by the nonus holder of a us trade or business notwithstanding the foregoing gain from the sale or exchange of the notes or their settlement at maturity may be subject to us federal income tax if that nonus holder is a nonresident alien individual and is present in the us for  days or more during the taxable year of the settlement at maturity sale call or exchange and certain other conditions are satisfied if a nonus holder of the notes is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the us and if gain realized on the settlement at maturity sale or exchange of the notes is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business and if certain tax treaties apply is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the nonus holder in the us the nonus holder generally will be subject to us federal income tax on such gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a us holder such nonus holders should read the material under the heading us holders for a description of the us federal income tax consequences of acquiring owning and disposing of the notes in addition if such nonus holder is a foreign corporation it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to  or such lower rate provided by any applicable tax treaty of a portion of its   ps table of contents earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the us subject to certain adjustments a dividend equivalent payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the us and such payments generally would be subject to a  or a lower rate under an applicable treaty us withholding tax if paid to a nonus holder under treasury regulations certain payments including deemed payments that are contingent upon or determined by reference to actual or estimated us source dividends with respect to certain equitylinked instruments whether explicitly stated or implicitly taken into account in computing one or more of the terms of such instruments may be treated as dividend equivalents however this withholding on dividend equivalent payments if any will not apply to equitylinked instruments issued before january   if any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding we or the applicable paying agent would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld as discussed above alternative characterizations of the notes for us federal income tax purposes are possible should an alternative characterization by reason of change or clarification of the law by regulation or otherwise cause payments as to the notes to become subject to withholding tax we will withhold tax at the applicable statutory rate as discussed above the irs has indicated in the notice that it is considering whether income in respect of instruments such as the notes should be subject to withholding tax prospective nonus holders of the notes should consult their own tax advisors in this regard us federal estate tax under current law while the matter is not entirely clear individual nonus holders and entities whose property is potentially includible in those individuals gross estates for us federal estate tax purposes for example a trust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the individual has retained certain interests or powers should note that absent an applicable treaty benefit the notes are likely to be treated as us situs property subject to us federal estate tax these individuals and entities should consult their own tax advisors regarding the us federal estate tax consequences of investing in the notes backup withholding and information reporting please see the discussion under us federal income tax considerations  taxation of debt securities  backup withholding and information reporting in the accompanying prospectus for a description of the applicability of the backup withholding and information reporting rules to payments made on the notes foreign account tax compliance act the irs has announced that withholding

plan  should consider the fiduciary standards of erisa in the context of the plans particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the notes accordingly among other factors the fiduciary should consider whether the investment would satisfy the prudence and diversification requirements of erisa and would be consistent with the documents and instruments governing the plan the fiduciary investment considerations summarized above generally apply to employee benefit plans maintained by privatesector employers and to individual retirement accounts and other arrangements subject to section  of the code but generally do not apply to governmental plans as defined in section  of erisa certain church plans as defined in section  of erisa and foreign plans as described in section b of erisa however these other plans may be subject to similar provisions under applicable federal state local foreign or other regulations rules or laws  similar laws  the fiduciaries of plans subject to similar laws should also consider the foregoing issues in general terms as well as any further issues arising under the applicable similar laws in addition we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates may be each considered a party in interest within the meaning of erisa or a disqualified person within the meaning of the code with respect to many plans as well as many

other general operating expenses any line item amounts not expended completely shall be held in reserve as working capital and subject to reallocation to other line item expenditures as required for ongoing operations the market for resale of sporting event tickets is constantly changing and may have seasonal shifts and are highly dependent upon the performance of a given team within their regional market as such it is difficult to determine consistent projections for demand for ticket sales because of these uncertainties the use of proceeds as laid forth above are general estimates based upon our understanding of the current markets as some sports seasons wind down and others begin we will adjust according to market demand if demand is low we may have to allocate additional funds toward marketing and advertising the funds from this offering will not be used to pay zev turetsky for his services to the company whether provided prior to during or subsequent to the offering there can be no assurance that the company will raise any funds through this offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised the company will use such funds according to their best judgment in accordance with the “use of proceeds” chart this discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the use of proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in funds allocated to each specific item listed and would not differ materially from the “use of proceeds” chart above to the extent our offering proceeds do not cover any professional fees incurred by the company we anticipate paying for any such expenses out of any additional funding or revenues we receive if we require additional funding we will seek such funds from friends family and business acquaintances in order to continue our operations as with any form of financing there are uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds on terms acceptable to us as we have not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from our friends family members or business acquaintances regarding potential investments in our company barrier to entry in the industry is extremely low and there are many competitors before we launch our own website for the purpose of selling our tickets our primary competition will be other ticket resellers on stubhub once we successfully launch our website our competition will consist of companies such as stubhub ticketliquidatorcom ticketnetworkcom ticketsnowcom and vividseatscom for events that fail to sell out we will also compete with primary ticket vendors such as ticketmaster as a small company compared to some of our competitors they have significantly greater financial and marketing resources they may have a greater advantage to negotiate higher commissions because of their more recognizable brand there are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful company description zev ventures inc was incorporated in the state of nevada on december   the company purchases sporting events tickets in bulk directly from ticket vendors such as ticketmaster and the sports franchises and sports associations directly the company intends to focus primarily on tickets offered by the following sports leagues major league baseball “mlb” the national basketball association “nba” the national hockey league “nhl” and the national football league “nfl” teams in these leagues sell their tickets for below market price in order to insure games are sold out and to maintain customer loyalty we
