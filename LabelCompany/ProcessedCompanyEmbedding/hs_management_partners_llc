partners”  “hsmp”  “firm”  “we”  “our”  “its”  and  “us” on this website refer to hs management partners llc   the use of the term “composite” on this website refers to our hs management partners concentrated quality growth composite hsmp offers one sole investment strategy   hsmp concentrated quality growth equity strategy   see item  of our firm brochure adv part a for a description of our investment process    we seek to apply our investment strategy to all client accounts with the goal of minimizing dispersion and providing similar investment results across accounts over time    however the implementation of our investment strategy depends on several factors including client restrictions type and size of the account timing and market conditions at the account’s inception and further contributions or withdrawals timing and terms of trade execution orders and client directed brokerage and commission recapture instructions    therefore an account’s holdings and investment performance could deviate from other client accounts managed in accordance with our sole strategy    clients’ experience may vary for several reasons and clients and prospective clients should not assume or infer that their experience will be similar to that of other past or existing clients    given our investment strategy as stated above we tailor our investment advice to clients in limited circumstances the decision to open an account with hsmp is that of the client and therefore it is up to each client to determine whether hsmp’s management strategy is appropriate for hisher specific situation    we solely advise clients as to the portion of their assets for which we have been given discretionary management in accordance with our investment strategy    we do not advise clients on their overall financial plan    further we do not take into consideration clients’ assets or investments outside of our management when implementing our strategy in their accounts at hsmp in implementing our investment strategy we typically build a concentrated portfolio with a hard cap on company names and with an aim to keeping our client’s capital nearly fully invested    client accounts generally hold  to  companies although in certain circumstances they may hold more or less names for example during certain transitional periods of selling or buying a security or due to some corporate actions such as spinoffs or due to some other factors    cash is not a major component of our strategy and we tend to keep very low cash balances in client accounts    although we primarily invest in domestic securities in the form of common stock client portfolios can include foreign issuer equity securities in the form of american depository receipts both sponsored and nonsponsored or ordinary shares    as bottomup fundamentalsfirst investors we do not maintain limits on industry or sector weightings and while we do limit portfolio positions by company clients’ portfolios are likely to be significantly concentrated by sector industry andor geography among other factors for example clients’ portfolios can have over  exposure to the consumer discretionary consumer staples andor technology sectors    we take an incremental approach to actively managing client portfolios    historically our annual portfolio turnover rate has ranged generally between  to  measured in dollars and is comprised of new names and incremental changes to existing positions hsmp claims compliance with the global investment performance standards gips®    for the purpose of complying with gips® hs management partners defines itself as hs management partners llc an independent sec registered investment adviser    please note that although hsmp is registered with the sec as an investment adviser sec registration does not imply any certain level of skill or training    the composite includes all fully discretionary fee paying accounts which employ our style of investing in  to  quality growth businesses    these accounts must have a market value of greater than  at the time of initial inclusion including those accounts no longer with the firm    the us dollar is the currency used to express performance    for more information or for a copy of our fully compliant gips® presentation andor list of composite descriptions please contact us at  for benchmark purposes the composite is compared to the sp ® and russell ® growth indices    the sp ® index is an unmanaged capitalizationweighted index of  stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of  stocks representing all major industries    the russell ® growth index measures the performance of those russell  companies with higher pricetobook ratios and higher forecasted growth values  the performance comparisons on this website are provided for market context only and there are meaningful differences between the composite and the sp ® and russell ® growth indices that should be considered when comparing performance    for example the average market capitalization of companies in the composite will likely differ from that of either index the composite is much more concentrated than either index in terms of companies and sectors and the volatility of the composite may be greater or less than that of either index    in addition market or economic conditions may affect positively or negatively the performance of the composite but not the indices which do not bear market risk    moreover the performance of the composite may vary from that of the indices due to the performance of stocks held in the composite but not included in the indices or stocks included in the indices but not held in the composite client account performance may vary from that of the composite or from that of other client accounts for reasons such as client restrictions type and size of the account timing and market conditions at the account’s inception and further contributions or withdrawals timing and terms of trade execution orders and client directed brokerage and commission recapture instructions performance returns presented on this website reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings    composite returns are presented net of advisory fees and trading costs but do not reflect the effect of us or foreign taxes    neither index bears fees and expenses and investors cannot invest directly in either of them the yeartodate performance results shown on our performance page are preliminary and have not been verified upside downside ratios shown on our risk page were computed by dividing the cumulative annualized return of the hsmp composite netoffee in months of positive negative index returns by the cumulative annualized return of said index for those same months in other words the upside ratio represents the percentage share of participation the hsmp concentrated quality growth portfolio captured as a percentage of the index gain in the months when the respective index was positive while the downside capture ratio represents the percentage share of participation the hsmp portfolio captured as a percentage of the index decline in months when the respective index was negative there is no guarantee that investing with hsmp will be profitable or that we will be able to effectively manage risk or

home  approach hs management partners applies a focused bottomup fundamental approach to quality growth equity portfolio management  our experienced research team seeks to build a concentrated portfolio of  quality growth businesses core to our approach is an emphasis on the quality of the business the underlying earningscash flow potential of the business and the valuation of the security  our repeatable process allows for us to develop a strong working knowledge of the names in client portfolios  suitable investment candidates for us typically include companies that we believe possess strong management teams attractive business models enduring competitive advantages high free cash flow characteristics broad geographic platforms strong albeit reasonably attainable earningscash flow prospects as fundamental investors we focus on identifying good businesses that we believe can place upward pressure on client portfolios by virtue of marrying growing earnings and cash flow streams with an attractive valuation in seeking to identify attractive investment opportunities we employ a multidimensional approach to growth in businesses across the growth continuum up and down the market capitalization scale and around the world including nonus domiciled equities provided our quality criteria are satisfied  we are benchmark agnostic though we have found that companies that satisfy our investment criteria and objective of realizing generally predictable earnings and cash flow growth over time tend to operate in select industries while we are bottomup investors we believe that macro matters  and while we take a longterm view in investing we believe that active management adds value  at hsmp we treat our clients’ capital as scarce capital  some of the main factors that influence our decision to partially or completely liquidate a security include our belief that a company’s fundamentals have diminished its valuation has become too extended according to our criteria andor that a better investment alternative exists for our clients’ capital  our concentrated approach to portfolio management necessitates we apply our best thinking therefore requiring that we make tough decisions so as to maintain our  stock ceiling hsmp’s investment philosophy is fundamentally grounded and we believe pragmatic in nature over time our approach has yielded positive absolute and relative longterm performance   note  there is no guarantee that investing with hsmp will be profitable or that we will be able to effectively manage risk  please refer to disclosures and our firm
