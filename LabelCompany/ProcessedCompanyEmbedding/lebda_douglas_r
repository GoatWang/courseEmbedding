chief executive of treecom a public company based in charlotte nc and the parent of lendingtreecom an online marketplace that matches mortgage borrowers with lendersmr lebda started lendingtree in  and in  it was acquired by iacinteractivecorp lendingtree was spun off by iac five years later under the corporate name treecom interview conducted and condensed by vivian marinoq lendingtree grew out of your own frustration with mortgage shopping a so in  i bought a condo in pittsburgh i opened up the newspaper looked at interest rates and picked a bank that had the lowest rate i walked down to the bank branch and applied for a loan sure enough the rate in the paper wasn’t the rate they offered me i tried to comparison shop and of course i had to walk to another bank branch advertisement continue reading the main story i thought why can’t you have banks compete for business and create a marketplace the same way as you can for anything else i founded the company because i felt that the banks had control over me in this process and i felt very disempowered through the whole thing i think consumers still feel that way continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q what was the genesis of the “tree” name a before lendingtree the company was named credit source for a very brief time on the eve of closing my very first financing i got a letter from a major financial services firm who will remain unnamed saying they have the name “credit source” and you can’t use itwe went through a naming exercise with an agency we brainstormed hundreds of names before choosing lendingtree some of them were just horrible i remember one of them was loanranger i was first going down the path of something related to “exchange” like loanex at one point we had the name lendexq which was the first lender to sign up a it was pnc then national citytoday we have over  lenders — not all the big ones are on there all the timeq how much do lenders pay lendingtree to facilitate deals a they pay us a fee for every borrower we introduce them to and that will vary it’ll be as low as a couple of dollars to as high as over  photo credit earl wilsonthe new york times q

lending market right now a as refinancing is slowing down banks need more volume and so they look to people like us to give them volume underwriting standards are starting to loosen a little bitq how so a it really involves the credit score loantovalue ratio and debttoincome ratio lowering the credit score allowing higher debttoincome ratios and higher loantovalues advertisement continue reading the main story q where do you see the company in the next few years a the internet has made it easier to shop for prices but it’s almost made it more confusing not less we find that most consumers don’t comparison shop for a mortgagewe want to demystify that through new tools and improvements in our technology and in our processes we want to make it so everybody can have an account on lendingtree — whether you’re a customer or not we want to make the tools and the calculators easy to use save scenarios and figure out what you can affordwe just launched a rate table product we’re launching something called the best loan for life in the middle of this year which will enable you to never have to guess again whether you should refinance we’ll simply monitor your credit we’ll monitor your home value we’ll let you set a goal and when the goal is achieved — whether it’s a savings goal or shortening your payment or term or reducing your payment — we will essentially introduce you to a lender to do that dealwe’re also launching something called the lender directory — like a tripadvisor for the mortgage industry for loan officers or mortgage brokers there will be a page on lendingtree where their customers can rate them and review themq what about mobile users a we’re redoing our mobile site right now to make it better we have not done any apps yet we have one small ratefinder app that hasn’t gotten a lot of traction that’s something else we expect to address this year the best mobile applications are ones that actually need to be locationdependent shopping for homes for example is a great mobile app figuring out a restaurant is a great mobile app while you’re on the go things where you need to get alerted are good mobile apps filling out a mortgage form not so muchq so are you still doing ironman triathlons a i did kona two years ago and switched to ultramarathons running is a great time to think and just relax continue reading the main story we’re
