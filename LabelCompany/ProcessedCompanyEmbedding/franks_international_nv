managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in part ii item  financial statements and supplementary data included in this form k this section contains forwardlooking statements that are based on managements current expectations estimates and projections about our business and operations and involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forwardlooking statements because of various factors including those described in the sections titled cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements risk factors and elsewhere in this form k overview of business we are a global provider of highly engineered tubular services tubular fabrication and specialty well construction and well intervention solutions to the oil and gas industry and have been in business for over  years we provide our services to leading exploration and production companies in both offshore and onshore environments with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells we conduct our business through four operating segments international services we currently provide our services in approximately  countries on six continents our customers in these international markets are primarily large exploration and production companies including integrated oil and gas companies and national oil and gas companies us services we service customers in the offshore areas of the us gulf of mexico in addition we have a presence in the active onshore oil and gas drilling regions in the us including the permian basin eagle ford shale haynesville shale marcellus shale dj basin and utica shale tubular sales we design manufacture and distribute large od pipe connectors and casing attachments and sell large od pipe originally manufactured by various pipe mills we also provide specialized fabrication and welding services in support of offshore projects including drilling and production risers flowlines and pipeline end terminations as well as longlength tubulars up to  feet in length for use as caissons or pilings this segment also designs and manufactures proprietary equipment for use in our international and us services segments blackhawk we provide well construction and well intervention rental equipment services and products in addition to cementing tool expertise in the us and mexican gulf of mexico onshore us and other select international locations how we generate our revenue the majority of our services revenues are derived primarily from personnel rates for our specially trained employees who perform tubular and other well construction services for our customers and rental rates for the suite of products and equipment that our employees use to perform these services in addition our customers typically reimburse us for transportation costs that we incur in connection with transporting our products and equipment from our staging areas to the customers job sites in contrast our tubular sales revenues are derived from sales of certain products including large od pipe connectors and large od pipe manufactured by third parties directly to external customers the acquisition of blackhawk resulted in a new segment for us our blackhawk revenues are derived from well construction and well intervention rental equipment services and products these revenues have historically been split evenly between sold and rented products or equipment with certain rented products having a service element for personnel overseeing the operation of the equipment outlook we expect to see improvement in the oil field services industry in  as global capital spending on oil and natural gas exploration and production is likely to increase modestly in response to higher commodity prices however much of the anticipated increase in spending will likely be associated with onshore projects that contribute lower revenue and margins to the company than offshore projects material increases in activity in the deep and ultradeep offshore markets are not expected until further improvement in oil and natural gas prices are seen and in some basins may continue to deteriorate we have made efforts to reduce the impact of the lower activity levels by reducing costs but additional actions may be necessary if we continue to see decreased investment in global offshore projects our offshore businesses both in the us and internationally continue to see delays and cancellations as customers reduce spending or elect to reallocate financial resources to other onshore projects these delays or cancellations have been more prevalent in the deep and ultradeep water markets where our services are most profitable in areas where new projects are being sanctioned we have seen increased competition and awarded tenders often are secured at prices below historical levels our efforts to grow market share in the underrepresented offshore shelf market are expected to support revenues but are unlikely to fully offset declines in the deep and ultradeep water our onshore operations are expected to see sequential improvement particularly in the us onshore market as drilling activity has risen meaningfully in recent months the increase in demand for our services combined with a leaner cost structure is expected to result in higher revenues and improved profitability for this business in the coming year the tubular sales business is driven by specialized needs of our customers and the timing of projects specifically in the gulf of mexico due to steep declines in activity in the gulf of mexico and low visibility on forthcoming orders for these services we anticipate that revenues associated with this segment will trend lower until additional projects are sanctioned and commence operations the blackhawk product and service lines face similar challenges in the offshore market as our tubular services business blackhawk revenues are primarily generated offshore in the us gulf of mexico and are at risk if activity levels were to decrease further however we will benefit from a full year of operations from blackhawk in  which will likely help drive our total revenues sequentially higher overall our market outlook is mixed as the onshore begins to lead the recovery but the offshore market lags as prices remain below economic breakeven levels for many projects we remain in a very strong position financially with a significant cash balance relative to our debt how we evaluate our operations we use a number of financial and operational measures to routinely analyze and evaluate the performance of our business including revenue adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and safety performance revenue we analyze our revenue growth by comparing actual monthly revenue to our internal projections for each month to assess our performance we also assess incremental changes in our monthly revenue across our operating segments to identify potential areas for improvement adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before net interest income or expense depreciation and amortization income tax benefit or expense asset impairments gain or loss on sale of assets foreign currency gain or loss equitybased compensation unrealized gain or loss other noncash adjustments and other charges or credits adjusted ebitda margin reflects our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of our revenues we review adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin on both a consolidated basis and on a segment basis we use adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to assess our financial performance because it allows us to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure such as varying levels of interest expense asset base such as depreciation and amortization items outside the control of our management team such as income tax and foreign currency exchange rates and other charges outside the normal course of business adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to net income the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda our most directly comparable gaap performance measure as well as adjusted ebitda margin for each of the periods presented in thousands year ended december     net income loss        interest income net       depreciation and amortization    income tax benefit expense     gain loss on sale of assets     foreign currency loss    charges and credits     adjusted ebitda       adjusted ebitda margin        comprised of equitybased compensation expense  merger and acquisition costs nonenone severance and other charges      safety performance maintaining a strong safety record is a critical component of our operational success many of our customers have safety standards we must satisfy before we can perform services as a result we continually monitor and improve our safety performance through the evaluation of safety observations job and customer surveys and safety data in addition we continually develop new safety programs based on industry trends and our internal data the primary measure for our safety performance is the tracking of the total recordable incident rate trir trir is a measure of the rate of recordable workplace injuries normalized on the basis of  full time employees for an annual period the factor is derived by multiplying the number of recordable injuries in a calendar year by  and dividing this value by the total hours actually worked in the year a recordable injury includes occupational death nonfatal occupational illness and other occupational injuries that involve loss of consciousness lost time injuries restriction of work or motion cases transfer to another job or medical treatment cases other than first aid the table below presents our worldwide trir for the years ended december    and  trir    results of operations the following table presents our

segments consolidated results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december   revenues revenues from external customers excluding intersegment sales for the year ended december   decreased by  million or  to  million from  million for the year ended december   the decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues in the majority of our segments due to declining activity as depressed oil and gas prices resulted in reduced rig count downward pricing pressures rig cancellations and delays as well as deferred work scopes in the international and us services regions while revenues for tubular sales decreased due to lower international demand and decreased deep water fabrication revenue the decreased revenues were partially offset by revenues in our blackhawk segment of  million resulting from our acquisition in november  see note   acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our blackhawk acquisition revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading operating segment results cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization cost of revenues for the year ended december   decreased by  million or  to  million from  million for the year ended december   the decrease was due to lower activity volumes offset by cost actions taken throughout  we also incurred additional costs of  million related to our blackhawk acquisition in november  general and administrative expenses general and administrative ga expenses for the year ended december   decreased by  million or  to  million from  million for the year ended december   excluding the bad debt expense of  million related primarily to the collectability of receivables in venezuela see customer credit risk in part ii item a and the bankrupt customer in nigeria general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   decreased by  million or  primarily as a result of declining activity and pricing pressures offset by internal cost initiatives which included workforce reductions and lease terminations also equitybased compensation expense decreased by  million as the ipo grants for retirementeligible employees had a two year service requirement which was completed during the third quarter of  the decreased costs were partially offset by an increase in professional fees which included costs related to our ongoing global corporate initiatives and the investigation mentioned in note   commitments and contingencies in the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   increased by  million or  to  million from  million for the year ended december   the increase was primarily attributable to our timco and blackhawk acquisitions as well as a higher depreciable base resulting from property and equipment additions severance and other charges severance and other charges for the year ended december   were  million as we continued to take steps to adjust our workforce to meet the depressed demand in the industry in addition to the retirement of fixed assets of  million see note   severance and other charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements which affected the following segments international services  million us services  million and tubular sales  million merger and acquisition costs merger and acquisition costs for the year ended december   were  million as a result of our blackhawk acquisition as mentioned in note   acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements foreign currency loss foreign currency loss for the year ended december   increased by  million to  million from  million for the year ended december   the increase was primarily due to the devaluation of the nigerian naira income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   decreased by  million or  to  million from  million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in taxable income and a change in jurisdictional mix we are subject to many us and foreign tax jurisdictions and many tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities our operations in these jurisdictions are taxed on various bases such as income before taxes deemed profits which is generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits and withholding taxes based on revenues consequently the relationship between our pretax income from operations and our income tax provision varies from

press release and the accompanying schedules include the nongaap financial measures of adjusted earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin which may be used periodically by management when discussing the company’s financial results with investors and analysts the accompanying schedules of this press release provide a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap adjusted earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are presented because management believes these metrics provide additional information relative to the performance of the company’s business these metrics are commonly employed by financial analysts and investors to evaluate the operating and financial performance of the company from period to period and to compare it with the performance of other publicly traded companies within the industry you should not consider adjusted earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under gaap because adjusted earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may be defined differently by other companies in the company’s industry the company’s presentation of adjusted earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing their utilitythe company defines adjusted earnings loss per share as earnings loss per share before severance and other charges net of tax and merger and acquisition costs net of tax the company defines adjusted ebitda as income from continuing operations before net interest income or expense depreciation and amortization income tax benefit or expense asset impairments gain or loss on sale of assets foreign currency gain or loss equitybased compensation other noncash adjustments and unusual charges the company uses adjusted ebitda to assess its financial performance because it allows the company to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of its capital structure such as varying levels of interest expense asset base such as depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of the company’s management team such as income tax rates the company defines adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda divided by total revenueplease see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures franks
