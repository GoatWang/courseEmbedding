ebitda free cash flow and pro forma informationthe company uses certain measures that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to evaluate various aspects of its business adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are nongaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for consolidated net income loss and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with gaap these terms as defined by charter may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income loss and net cash flows from operating activities respectively in the addendum to this releaseadjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net income loss plus net interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization stock compensation expense loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on financial instruments other income expense net and other operating income expenses such as merger and restructuring costs special charges and gain loss on sale or retirement of assets as such it eliminates the significant noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capitalintensive nature of the company’s businesses as well as other noncash or special items and is unaffected by the company’s capital structure or investment activities however this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing these costs are evaluated through other financial measuresfree cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expendituresmanagement and charter’s board of directors use adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to assess charter’s performance and its ability to service its debt fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds in addition adjusted ebitda generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the company’s credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes all such documents have been previously filed with the the sec for the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage  covenants
