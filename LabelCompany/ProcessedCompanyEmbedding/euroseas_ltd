were maximum  tons and cost about  pounds sterling to build according to company records the first pittas family shipowner was nikolaos f pittas he was born on the island of chios in greece in  the first vessel he owned was ypapanti a ton wooden sail vessel that was built in chios in  he became the captain of the ship and his younger brothers and other relatives and friends joined him as crew the vessel traded in the mediterranean and black sea and the captain himself always found its next employment from the destination port he was at all times the commercial technical and financial manager of the vessel no office ashore existed as communications were so poor that people at the home island in chios often had no news of their whereabouts for months business was flourishing at the time and soon n f pittas could afford the purchase of more ships the next ships purchased were the sotiras a ton ship that was bought in  and the barque chios the first  ton ship which was built in chios in  a few other ships followed some were entrusted initially to brothers of n f pittas and subsequent purchases to his sons key executivesedit mr aristides j pittas — chairman chief exec officer
