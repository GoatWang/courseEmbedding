value of our franchise to our clients and develop enterprise clients our enterprise clients use multiple technologies across our premier loansphere platform of integrated technology that supports the mortgage and home equity loan lifecycle this quarter i wanted to discuss a few recent wins that are great examples of clients leveraging the enterprise power of black knight first off we recently signed a longterm agreement with keybank one of the nations largest financial services company the evolution of keybank is a prime example of how black knight and our clients can grow together keybank has been a longtime user of our loansphere bankruptcy foreclosure and invoicing solutions two years ago keybank then began using our empower loan origination system and exchange collaboration network to enhance their frontend processes this quarter keybank signed a contract to implement our industryleading msp platform to service first mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit they also added our portfolio overview insight solution which leverages our data hub and motivity capabilities and underlying technologies to help them proactively monitor and manage their servicing operation through the use of key performance metrics keybank will also begin using other da solutions including lien alert and mcdash which are integrated with msp this deal significantly increases the value keybank will realize through an integrated endtoend solution set as a result keybank will be the latest to join the ranks of our enterprise clients another enterprise client that uses empower to originate first mortgages and also uses our exchange msp and bankruptcy and foreclosure solutions recently expanded its empower contract to include home equity loans and lines of credit consolidating its first mortgages and home equity products onto empower will help this top home equity originator improve efficiency and risk management they are also implementing our loansphere data hub and motivity solutions as well as our other leading solutions together these products will give them greater insight into all areas of its business and allow them to provide enhanced customer service to consumers as they go through the mortgage process regions bank another existing enterprise client that uses empower to originate first mortgages and msp to service them recently signed an agreement to use empower to originate home equity lines and loans and is converting home equity lines and loans from another servicing platform to msp these are all great examples of the positive outcome we are

continue to integrate our technologies we are delivering our data and analytics solutions through our technology platforms we are developing new and innovative solutions to help our clients compete stronger and we continue to look for ways to support our clients and further our leadership in the industry we believe enterprise clients can realize exponential value from the integration of our technology data and analytics through greater efficiencies improved financial performance as well as reduced risk another strategic goal we have made significant progress on is increasing our market share in the home equity space with both empower and msp at the end of  approximately  of home equity loans and lines were serviced on msp with the successful conversion of jpmorgan chases home equity portfolio as well as the conversions we have in progress including pnc wells fargo bank of america and a handful of others we expect to have approximately  of the nations home equity loans being serviced by msp as i have said in the past we are very focused both on securing new sales and successfully implementing the many deals we have signed i am extremely excited to report that last month we completed the conversion of more than  million home equity and private banking loans to msp for jpmorgan chase we are incredibly proud to have successfully delivered this large conversion which was the result of exceptional teamwork tireless dedication and steadfast diligence from both companies we have a strong reputation for completing successful conversion of first mortgages for the industrys participants large and small with this conversion of the countrys second largest servicer we have proven that we have the same capability for converting home equity loans the ability to successfully deliver scalable platform for institutions of all sizes is a clear differentiator for black knight as such we continue to make solid progress on other significant platform conversions that i have mentioned on previous calls many of these are currently scheduled to be completed by the end of the year and we are working closely with our clients to finish these projects next id like to provide an update on our progress for delivering new and innovative solutions another key growth strategy in delivering these solutions we may develop tools internally or partner with other companies to share development cost or accelerating time to market we continue to deliver on our digital strategy which includes adding digital technology capabilities to many of our products across the loan lifecycle we are working to provide these interfaces to our system that will deliver data digitally to be used by our clients mobile app and to deliver mobile apps that the clients can use we are also focused on delivering innovative solutions that leverage our data assets such as the data hub and motivity insight we recently delivered portfolio overview insight which allows servicers to proactively monitor and manage their servicing operation through the use of key performance metrics i mentioned earlier that keybank will be leveraging this insight overall we continue to achieve greater penetration of our solutions with existing clients launch new and innovative products that drive efficiency and help to reduce risk within their organization and execute on highly complex platform implementation for the largest banks in the nation thank you for your time today i will now turn the call over to kirk for an indepth financial update kirk larsen thank you tom and good afternoon

adjusted ebitda margin was  an increase of  basis points compared to the prior year adjusted net earnings were  million an increase of  compared to the prior year adjusted net earnings per share were  an increase of  compared to the prior year and finally yeartodate capex was  million turning now to slide  ill discuss our technology segment results in the second quarter adjusted revenues for the technology segment increased  to  million our servicing technology business had adjusted revenues growth of  primarily driven by favorable client mix price increases and higher transactional volumes on our core servicing platform in our origination technology business adjusted revenues declined by  driven primarily by lower consulting revenues and volumes on the exchange as a result of a decline in refinancing originations of  as reported by the mba that more than offset incremental revenues from the elynx acquisition adjusted ebitda increased  to  million while adjusted ebitda margin was  an increase of  basis points compared to the prior year quarter yeartodate adjusted revenues in the technology segment increased  to  million driven by our servicing technology business that had adjusted revenue growth of  adjusted ebitda increased  to  million while adjusted ebitda margin was  an increase of  basis points compared to the prior year turning to slide  in the second quarter adjusted revenues for the data and analytics segment were  million compared to  million in the prior year quarter excluding the effect of the property insight realignment revenues increased  compared to the prior year quarter driven by the growth in our property data and multiple listing service businesses and the motivity solutions acquisition adjusted ebitda increased  to  million while adjusted ebitda

million we had revolver borrowings outstanding of  million and  million of borrowing capacity remaining under our revolver our growth leverage ratio was x and our net leverage ratio was x during the second quarter we repurchased approximately  million shares at a total cost of  million or  per share we have approximately  million shares available to repurchase under our existing  million share authorization turning now to slide  we are reaffirming our outlook for the full year  we continue to expect revenues and adjusted revenues growth of  to  which is  to  if we adjust to reflect the property insight realignment as if it took place on january   we expect adjusted ebitda growth of  to  and adjusted eps of  to  that represents growth of  to  compared to  additional modeling details underlying our outlook include interest expense of approximately  million depreciation and amortization expense of  million excluding the net incremental depreciation and amortization resulting from purchase accounting we expect a fullydistributed effective tax rate of approximately  diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  million to  million shares and finally capex of approximately  million overall we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and the continued positive momentum at black knight operator please open the line for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from tientsin huang of jpmorgan please go ahead tientsin huang just i guess kirk i was trying to get at organic revenue growth just elynx and whatnot is it fair to say the organic growth in the second quarter was pretty steady to the first on revenue kirk larsen the second quarter tientsin was a little bit different than the first one we had tougher comparison than in the first quarter as it related to license fee and origination technology q of last year and plus the decline in refi was more pronounced in q relative to q which continue to go that direction as we look at the pattern of refinancing originations last year so q was a little bit different from q in those respects and plus the other thing is we lapped the implementation of ditech which went live in the second quarter of last year tientsin huang got it okay but that said i think just thinking about the incremental the calculated incremental ebitda margin was quite high in the second quarter certainly high than the first quarter is that just a function of mix with origination like you said and consulting being called out kirk larsen we did have favorable revenue mix you could see that particularly in data and analytics and as we talked about in the past tientsin we certainly are always proactive on the cost side and so we saw some incremental benefit there also in the second quarter tientsin huang got it okay so yes so its kind of a natural hedge with the mix but just last one and ill get off the line just i guess the share repurchase saw that in the second quarter which was a little new so the share repurchase philosophy from here i know youve called out that youd be proactive in addressing some of the supply any additional comments around share repurchase tom sanzone i think what we are going to be doing is watching the effects of the spinoff and based upon the price activity around the spinoff we might even get very active in terms of repurchasing shares thats why we established the  million share repurchase authorization sometime i guess in the second quarter or the first quarter and we did repurchase  million shares because there was a little disruption when thl sold a part of their position so we are just going to be very well be very proactive and if we can reduce our share count by  million shares we have the cash to do it and that will just be a benefit to our shareholders so there is going to be a disruption were ready for it tientsin huang makes sense good thank you operator the next question is from bill warmington of wells fargo please go ahead bill warmington so a question for you on empower now last call you guys gave us some nice detail on the launch of that product and i just wanted to ask for an update in terms of what kind of traction you are getting how the pipeline looks the market reception tom sanzone we are right now managing an active pipeline for empower now the deals of course take some time to materialize but we are actively managing a number of opportunities for empower now bill warmington okay and then in terms of another thing that you guys had talked about last quarter was that there were some clientspecific implementation delays on the tech services side and i just wanted to circle back on those and see if those have been worked through and whether we are likely to see – whether they are now generating revenue or will generate revenue in the second half kirk larsen so we continue to progress on the implementation chase went live in the second quarter as tom mentioned these are part of loan transplant as we have talked about before so they are ongoing we continue to expect a number of them to go live in q and q last quarter we talked about a  percentage point approximate headwind from implementation delays that now looks more like  but weve got the back half of the year that we will continue to work through and get the clients implemented bill warmington excellent thank you very much operator the next question is from jason deleeuw of piper jaffray please go ahead jason deleeuw a question on guidance range and thinking about the second half of the year can you kind of help us think about the key drivers of the low to the high end on the revenue guidance range and then also on the adjusted ebitda guidance it implies an acceleration in the adjusted ebitda growth for the second half of the year what are the drivers that are expected to be there for the ebitda growth acceleration kirk larsen ill answer the last question first from an ebitda perspective we are expecting the revenue growth from the implementations in the second half to be at very high incremental margins and so really thats going to be what drives that acceleration on the ebitda margin side from where we are in the range its really the typical drivers of where were going to be in that right its the implementation timing which i just talked about there being  percentage point headwind from that pushout its professional services its on the fringes its origination volumes and then there is indiscernible deliver revenue back we go into each year being a part of the plan and certainly as we go through the year there is some element of that as well so that really would be how we end up where we are in the range what drives the second half growth its going to be the implementation i mean that is the only single biggest driver of the absolute result and so its just a matter of as i said before just working through those and getting the clients to go live and then where we end up in the range with that  pushing out that puts pressure on the top end jason deleeuw but the implementations is that just more of a timing aspect its not like youre going to lose the revenues so if we dont get it this year youll get it next year kirk larsen yes exactly as we mentioned last time thats a timing issue for us theyre going to go jason deleeuw got it thanks for that and then the investments in data and mobile that you highlighted just want to get a sense for is that becoming a much more important competitive differentiator and then what does that ultimately mean for the pricing and economics for black knight tom sanzone i mean as we have talked about many times on the calls and talked about black knights strategy we invested proactively in our data hub product and a number of our data products and acquisitions so that product is really core now to developing these enterprise clients so as an example if we have a servicing client nonenterprise so i think we have probably indiscernible in that space that were going to market with and we want to sell them on the ot piece there is the loan origination platform itself which is strong and a competitive advantage for black knight but then when we say hey we got this data product that links both servicing data msp with empower in a powerful and consolidated data product and oh by the way now we have acquired motivity and we are building our own insight you get all these powerful analytics on top of that now you have a product that has pretty much every transaction from the initiation of a loan through closing through servicing and if necessary for bankruptcy and foreclosure and that is a unique product okay so if a competitor of us indiscernible just wanted to go in there and compete and build an interface to msp that would be well and good they would not be able to produce this data product which we have in our architecture so you start to see the data hub being sold more and more youre hearing the motivity solution is being sold more and more you are hearing these things we saw insight being sold more and more so i would say that that investment we are making is just now kind of just starting to getting traction and build momentum operator the next question is from andrew jeffrey of suntrust please go ahead andrew jeffrey it sounds like – kirk a couple of questions on organic revenue growth to follow up on – there are obviously some moving parts here between refi and timing can you just talk a little bit about what you think that a technology sustainable organic revenue growth is in a more normalized refi environment perhaps what the mba might be anticipating next year just so we can think about kind of what you think the growth profile of that business is today and then ill ask a similar question in da particularly as it seems that you are starting to gain some traction there kirk larsen sure as far as in a more normal environment which given all the implementations over the next several years i dont know what a normal environment actually looks like from that perspective but typically we would expect with our servicing technology business thats going to be midsingledigit grower on more of a sustained basis with taking some share on getting more loans on msp organic growth on the first lien side expanding on the home equity side but thats sort of – and the new product from specialty servicing id say thats how that business is going to grow in a normal environment we expect more rapid growth in the normal environment out of our origination technology business there is plenty of whitespace there for us to grow that business and particularly with adding elynx to the mix so we just talked about that being a doubledigit growth business in a more normal environment without the headwinds from refi but of course a lot of that comes down to the timing of implementation which is why we have grown very rapidly in  and then we expect that growth to accelerate with the new implementations from a data and analytics perspective this quarter was certainly a bright spot in the property records data business we had a couple of those longterm deals that have some upfront revenues associated with them that benefited the quarter and is good from a mix perspective but thats the business that we absolutely are gaining traction from a crosssell perspective particularly as we sell into the servicing base and renew msp deals and include effectively a standard equipment from solutions like lien alert and others so we are excited about that business and we think that there is a lot of runway especially with the data hub that tom was speaking of earlier and we talked about before so thats the business that we would expect over time that growth to accelerate from where it has been as well andrew jeffrey okay and with regard to market share especially when you talk about property info and mls are those competitive wins or more crosssell if you had to characterize whats driving the growth there kirk larsen on the property records side in some cases its actually its really with real estate market participants that in some cases its existing business that we are expanding our relationship so it really wasnt taking someone out in other cases its a competitive win in mls it is a competitive win they are going from another platform to ours so that business has been doing really well the last several years and its been growing and in fact improving margins quite a bit as well operator the next question is from john campbell of stephens please go ahead john campbell just back to the origination business and empower now of those  customers you targeted about how many of those customers use msp on the backend kirk larsen its probably  or so its relatively limited because its going down to a space where the smaller originators arent necessarily the servicing client tom sanzone and some of them are using msp through a subservicer as well so thats a little bit different right as they are going through say like a cenlar someone like that they are on msp but they are going through a subservicer as an example so some have the msp platform directly and then there is a number that uses through a subservicer john campbell and you feel like you can save those guys money by allowing them to i guess eliminate the subservicer go straight to you guys and use you guys on the frontend as well tom sanzone they wouldnt have to i mean were very happy to have a client on msp with a subservicer as long as they are on our platform what the benefit is is you could do what i was saying before you could have an empower frontend that seamlessly integrates with msp and also you have the added benefit of putting in a data hub infrastructure with all the analytics and valueadd that i mentioned before so its really about seamlessly because its all our products youve got seamless connectivity plus if you use us front and back you get all your data in the data hub thats all mapped and can drive lots of powerful reporting and analytics john campbell that makes sense and then on i know empower now is a fairly new product you guys probably need a little bit more time with it but what are you thinking is the kind of standard timing of like a normal sales cycle tom sanzone i dont know im guessing six to eight months john campbell okay thats helpful and then last one from me on da margin obviously very good results this quarter i think it was up almost  bps yearoveryear i know some of that is driven by property insight but below the surface im getting to about  bps of margin expansion even excluding that so just i guess if you guys can walk through what drove that big lift and how sustainable that is kirk larsen clearly margins in the second quarter were above trend and a lot of that is there certainly is an ongoing focus to improve efficiency and improve the margins i think we have talked about that in our target of getting to  this quarter there certainly was a benefit from revenue mix and so the upfront benefit from some of those license deals were that came through at virtually  profit benefited us in the quarter so i wouldnt expect in the near term the margins to be right about here but as that business grows it will come on high incremental margins and so to the extent that we can grow the business on an accelerated basis the margins will come john campbell okay so high teens kind of low s from here is that fair kirk larsen i think thats in the right growth and then it will continue to trend up over time as we continue to grow that business operator the next question is from david ridleylane of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead david ridleylane so based on the timing of implementation obviously the technology segment is going to have a sequential increase in revenue in the third quarter should we expect much of a sequential revenue lift in the fourth quarter kirk larsen yes based on the timing of implementations indiscernible q should be stronger than q david ridleylane got it and then can you talk about the organic loan growth that you are seeing on the msp platform is that increasing on the first lien side and is it too early to see perhaps a pickup from here from faster growth in home equity line of credit kirk larsen we continue to see organic growth on the system as we have in the past we talked about  to  loans thats been relatively consistent so we continue to see that type of activity on the first lien side on the home equity side we can see the number of loans in the market growing its now over  million so we are seeing that i think well see it more pronounced as we implement the clients that are going live and start being a broader client base but certainly thats a market that there is an opportunity operator the next question is from jason weaver of wedbush securities please go ahead jason weaver i wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your market penetration on the second lien side and how you are pursuing that especially among the clients on msp with a lot of first lien present tom sanzone its pretty simple we invested in the capability we have now implemented it for a number of clients and then very important accomplishment for us was to do it at the highest level so we take our  core clients on msp we identify every one that does both first and second thats our sales lift based on size and opportunity and we are just going to really hit that market hard and consistently for the foreseeable future so thats how were going to go at it jason weaver okay thank you and on keybank can you just speak to the scope and i imagine its a similar timeline as other enterprise clients something like  months tom sanzone yes i mean its like the guidance we have given you before pretty much on average a year could it move it could but its a little bit more complicated when youre doing both first and second because in many clients they have a different infrastructure and a set of integrations for home equity versus servicing so in essence when we do a home equity and first implementation its not like with msp it was a one kind of implementation often its two so it could have a little bit of an extended timeline because youre retiring in a lot of cases you might be retiring infrastructure and platform in two different areas instead of one so i think its a good benchmark to think about it but it could actually be longer if were taking out two platforms operator the next question is from geoffrey dunn of dowling  partners please go ahead geoffrey dunn i actually have a similar question that was just asked and i want to followup with that as you have tried to approach existing first lien clients did you ever encountered any pushback or reasoning for not converting onto the second lien or was it more really just kind of an inevitable crosssell process tom sanzone its a great question and i think the best way to look at it now is with real hard data and if you look at the deals we have done both lets say new clients on msp and also renewals on msp you are seeing a pretty strong trend that they all or many are both home equity and first so it clearly to us from a business case perspective and many of the clients makes sense on many different points so there is definitely a cost component but there is equally a strong risk management component because remember the base driver is the consumerbased platforms that have home equity on them certainly they didnt put all the reg and compliance work that we did for first loan onto msp and so there is a strong business case component cost benefit and there is also a strong risk component so why wouldnt someone want to do it i mean it could be timing it could be contracts that are in place that have two more years to go it could be a number of different factors hopefully from our perspective its once again timing right its catching them at the right time in the right cycle and presenting them with the business kit operator the next question is from bose george of kbw please go ahead bose george just wanted to ask about the remaining roughly  pro forma of the first lien market thats not on msp is that a market you can continue to chip away at an msp value proposition different for some of the smaller servicers kirk larsen im sorry can you repeat the question bose george just the opportunity that you have in the roughly  of the servicing market thats not on msp how do you think that you can benefit that market and is the value proposition for those smaller servicers different just kind of trying to think about how much more market share you could get in the first lien market kirk larsen we continue to believe that we can win more share in the remaining  that we dont have we think the value proposition is strong for anyone who doesnt use msp so as we get everybody implemented every two in the top  and five total in the top  that arent on msp and we think there is a strong business case from a financial and a risk management perspective that they should be on msp relative to where they are today we will continue to pursue those clients those prospects because we think the value proposition is strong and we continue to sign deals so keybank is an example of one that we signed and we talked about already on the call so the value proposition with a smaller servicer we think is there as well bose george okay great thanks and then just can you remind me of the revenues on the first lien versus second are they pretty similar kirk larsen historically on the second lien side when we were building that business up we had a different pricing structure that was a little more aggressive we try to build that business up the strategy going forward is to have a loan be a loan and regardless whether its a first lien or a second lien thats a fresh loan in business ph operator the next question is from ashish sabadra of deutsche bank please go ahead ashish sabadra i just wanted to quickly ask about the servicing technology that business was growing like   and then it slowed down to  how should we think about that business going forward you have jpmorgan chase come on and a couple of other indiscernible coming on as well but then on the other side the comps get a bit slightly more difficult i just want to better understand on the servicing technology revenue growth going forward kirk larsen that business has been growing at a more elevated level and the reason why was we implemented ditech in april of  and so you saw the growth more in the high single low doubledigit range and then it came in at  this quarter that really was that comparison issue that once we lap that implementation were at the level that we are at i think this level is about where we expected to be in the nearterm well have the implementation come on and then we would expect that would accelerate once we being bank of america on but i think in the nearterm that that sort of high single digit area is where we would expect it to be ashish sabadra thats helpful and just quickly a question on origin nation you anniversaried elynx in the quarter so going forward you wont have the contribution from elynx but then you do have some origination go live coming in the back half just how should we think about the trend there because again there is a really difficult comp especially in the third quarter so any color on that front kirk larsen right the origination technology business if you look through the rest of the year well have some implementations go live in q and q so q is going to have the benefit a greater benefit from implementation than the third quarter will and the other issue is of comparisons which is the biggest decline that well have from a refi perspective that would affect the origination technology business specifically on the exchange in the third quarter so third quarter has a tougher comp from a refi perspective and will have some implementation growth and then the fourth quarter will have a greater benefit from implementations and so the q will be stronger than q so we would expect that q and q will be better than the second quarter because of implementations but you do have some other factors to consider ashish sabadra okay thats helpful and maybe just one quick housekeeping question i believe this year note was replaced with the term a loan which has a lower interest expense or interest rate still you have reiterated a  million of interest expense for the year so i was just wondering is that just conservatism and could there be like could the interest expense come in lower and is there upside to the earnings because of that kirk larsen the  million may end up being conservative we certainly raised and bounced around a bit and we could also make a decision to swap out some of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate which would then in the near term be higher than where the spot rate is and so some of that is contemplated in that  million but theres a possibility that it could come in lower than that if we choose not to swap out a little bit operator the next question is from kevin kaczmarek of zelman  associates please go ahead kevin kaczmarek could you talk about professional services within origination technology you called it out in the presentation i guess can you give us a sense of what percentage of origination technology revenue it is and how we should expect the professional services piece to bounce around as we progress through the year with all the implementations kirk larsen we havent gotten that granular as to revenue streams for a subset of the business kevin but the nuance in professional services within origination technology is that indiscernible talked about during the implementation period of a loan origination system the professional services related to that implementation gets deferred and then once the client goes live you then start to recognize that implementation revenue on a ratable basis and the additional work that you do for the client to help them optimize the system and work on process related matters you start to recognize those revenues in period and so what can ebb and flow a bit in professional services in origination technology really relates to implementations on it and so since where we are in the implementation cycle of the deals that we talked about ie they go live in the second half of the year thats really part of where you see that headwind that we spoke of and the drivers of the performance in the quarter kevin kaczmarek okay and on the keybank win trying to think of the revenue contribution it seems like they have really got back into the mortgage business by buying first niagara and i guess was first niagara a customer of yours i guess how could some revenue go away how should we think about the incremental contribution there kirk larsen this revenue wont go away as a result of it its all net new and certainly what we are thrilled to have as keybank signed up for the multiple products that they are signing up to they actually have a very nice home equity portfolio that were putting on msp so thats part of how we go from  up to  market share there they are a part of it so its a very good win were happy to have another enterprise client but as with other clients we dont size them specifically for reasons that we agreed to with the client but were happy with the win we think its great to keep adding loans on the msp and really through the crosssell success kevin kaczmarek okay great thanks a lot thats all i had operator the next question is from jim schneider of goldman sachs please go ahead james schneider maybe just a macro kind of policy question for a second we have the choice act get passed by the house short time ago and i wonder whats going to happen to the senate but i guess if you assume the house were to get passed do you think there will be any impact in terms of your business longerterm from a regulatory or less regulatory mandate on the part of the banks or do you think we are kind of at the point now where the banks are not so focused on regulatory mandates and its more going to be just a pure tech decision from now on tom sanzone we have talked about this one before as well honestly in the market right now if you look at the last even recent history here theres been some announcements of some pretty hefty fines against a number of players i view it as its kind of bau i do think that the clients are investing more in two areas more than they did in the past which is improving their financial performance in particular lowering costs and as weve talked about before our deals both on ot technology and servicing the pure cost benefit business cases are very strong but they still are focused on risk as well so i havent seen that really change i think its bau and risk they are focusing a little bit more on how do i reduce my cost in this business and improve my profitability and thats driving while we are also going to head up the development of new products and capabilities that we brought to market that we are now starting to get traction on so the answer to your question really is its more balanced but the nature of what black knight brings to the table on those business cases really hit all of those areas for the client james schneider helpful and then maybe as a follow up for kirk going back to the morgan question that was asked earlier good incremental traction on margins in the quarter if you stripped out the impact of mix in terms of revenue mix in terms of looking at the margin picture were there any other onetime impacts from a margin perspective to consider in the quarter and then as we go forward into q and q any onetime or other impacts to think about or should it just be kind of all standard high incremental flow through of margin based on the revenue uplift we see kirk larsen so of the margin expansion a part of that was related to the property insight realignment but then without that its  basis points of margin expansion so still strong the mix was certainly a part of it but with the onetimers we are talking about in the quarter related to the data deals is costing a few million dollar area so not significant moves the needle a bit in data and analytics but not material to the company as far as q and q there could be similar things thats part of the sell and deliver aspect of how we run the business that we look to do and so there could be some of those but they are harder to predict the timing of exactly when they are going to happen but the important point is the incremental margin in this business continues to be very high and so we would expect as the business grows well continue to expand margins at the rates that we have talked about in the past on a sustainable basis of  to  basis points operator our final question is from glenn greene of oppenheimer please go ahead glenn greene just a few questions and clarifications probably all for kirk im just wondering at sort of an update on the timeline of the big implementations on – i was sort of the understanding pmt was i guess mid so is it sort of still sort of imminent or is that a third quarter event and is bofa still on track for  is the citigroup move cenlar still on for  and then just a couple of quick followups after that kirk larsen we arent allowed by our clients to talk specifically about their implementation its sometimes ever but in many cases its once theyll complete theyll let us announce them but suffice to say we have had some delays and talked about that but they continue to progress and they are at risk when they are timing so when we put as far as a client by client analysis its actually not something we can provide glenn greene okay i think earlier in the year you had talked about getting you could probably answer this a  point revenue growth lift into  from the benefit of the  implementations as well as your scheduled  implementations is that still on track or is that sort of somewhat less accurate in the timing at this point tom sanzone the difficulty in answering that question is that that was that little point in time based upon deals we knew and we were implementing at that point so on an ongoing basis now we have implemented some we have signed new deals and so it really isnt – we cant really compare back to that  but suffice to say we had some implementation pushouts which then affected this year but then next year well get more of an effect on a yearoveryear basis and so there still should be a meaningful uptick but whether its exactly that same  you cant go back and compare it glenn greene okay and then just the final one on in terms of your revenue guide you had earlier in the year talked about i think  basis point drag just from the decline in mortgage volumes is that still sort of a reasonable base point we are thinking about kirk larsen yes its exactly in that

the fringes so that headwind is still the right place to be thinking about it glenn greene okay perfect thanks a lot operator thank you we have no further questions i would like to turn the conference

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
