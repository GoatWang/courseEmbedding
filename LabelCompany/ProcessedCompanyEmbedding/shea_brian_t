phdassistant professor of neurology  ken and ruth davee department and pharmacologythe primary aim of our research is to identify the genetic factors and biological mechanisms that cause epilepsy we use a variety of sequencing technologies to identify new genetic causes in both the dna regions that code for proteins genes and those that control the expression of these genes regulatory regions the second mission of our lab is to capitalize on the advances in gene discovery in epilepsy to create neuronal models of this disorder many of these epilepsy genes are involved in the control of expression of other genes in other words they are responsible for switching certain genes on or off during the development andor functioning of the brain this switching is dependent on the d structure of dna  called the epigenome we use stem cell biology to create models of these epigenetic genes to study how mutations affect the structure of the epigenome and the pathways affected identifying these pathways are the first step in finding new targets for therapeuticschristina e boots mdassistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology reproductive endo and infertilityinfertility assisted
