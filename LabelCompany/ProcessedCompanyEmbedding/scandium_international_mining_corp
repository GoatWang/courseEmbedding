international mining corp  news  nyngan scandium project confirming process test results received  fri jul   tsxscy last   more info news jun   nyngan scandium project confirming process test results received reno nevada june    scandium international mining corp tsxscy scandium international or the company is pleased to announce the results of a confirmatory metallurgical test work report from altrius engineering services aes of brisbane qld australia the test work results directly relate a list of recommended programs included in the recently released ni  definitive feasibility study dfs authored by lycopodium brisbane qld australia and filed on sedar aes devised and supervised these test work programs at the sgs laboratory in perth australia and at the nagrom laboratory in brisbane australia in addition to recent test work results the company also reports that the nyngan project environmental impact statement eis has completed its public exhibition and comment period metallurgical test work results the project dfs recommended a number of process flowsheet test work programs be investigated prior to commencing detailed engineering and construction those study areas included pressure leach hpal countercurrent decant circuits ccd solvent extraction sx and oxalate precipitation with specific work steps suggested in each area this latest test work program addresses all of these recommended areas and the results confirm recoveries and efficiencies that either meet or exceed the parameters used in the dfs highlights pressure leach test work achieved  recoveries from larger volume tests settling characteristics of leach discharge slurry show substantial improvement residue neutralization work meets or exceeds all environmental requirements as presented in the dfs and the environmental impact statement eis solvent extraction circuit optimization tests generated improved performance exceeding  recovery in single pass systems and product finish circuits produced  scandium oxide completing the recovery process from nyngan ore to finished scandia product test work specifics a series of   litre hpal tests were conducted at sgs in perth between february and april  the results of these tests augmented earlier leach performance data and also provided leach solution for downstream tests where additional optimization data was also sought the feedstream source of scandium in each case was nyngan limonite resource graded at approximately the head grade assumed in the dfs flowsheet test results were positive in all cases hpal recoveries exceeded  in the majority of options tested vs  in the dfs settling characteristics on hpal discharge slurry were substantially improved with the use of different chemical additions and at the solvent extraction stage test work produced superior loading performance with recovery in this step exceeding  further work was conducted on residue chemistry as well the process for residue neutralization as proposed in the dfs was fully tested and environmental requirements for tailings disposal at the project site were met the process flowsheet for producing final scandium product has also been confirmed by additional test work using the solutions produced at sgs these solutions were delivered to nagrom laboratories in brisbane where we have set up a mini solvent extraction sx pilot plant to test process variants to produce loaded strip liquor and to produce productgrade scandium oxide the results of this work produced  scandium oxide again confirming the process applied in the dfs is capable of generating high purity scandia product in a very simple single stage operationthis time directly from nyngan laterite resource scandium oxide grades of  exceed the requirements of the aluminum industry for use in aluminum alloys other project updates second town hall meeting held the company held a second town hall meeting in nyngan on may   to brief the community on project plans and impacts the meeting was announced in the local nyngan observer newspaper and attended by local members of the community the town council and the mayor discussion was encouraged and issues raised were general in nature environmental impact statement eis status as previously reported may   the eis has been completed and submitted to the nsw department of planning and environment the eis was accepted by the department after an adequacy review and the company met with department staff on may th for detailed discussions on details of the document and development plans after this formal departmental review meeting the eis was subsequently placed on public exhibition on may th for access by the public and other nsw governmental agencies for a period of  days the exhibition period was completed on friday june th the filing received relatively few comments none that represent an issue with development and will now be followed by further internal reviews and discussions between the company and various governmental agencies the final outcome sought from this formal environmental and developmental review is the granting of a ministerial development consent and subsequently a mining lease for project development anticipated as early as yearend  george putnam ceo of scandium international mining corp commented these latest metallurgical test work results further confirm a number of key parameters used in the dfs and they formally complete an important checklist item prior to the start of detailed engineering on the project the product specification achievement of  scandia from nyngan resource is particularly important it validates our earlier product quality work confirms a single pass sx system can deliver product to this standard and fully supports our planned product offering to the aluminum alloy industry this formally and empirically completes the nyngan resourcetoproduct cycle for us we view the efficient and positive eis public exhibition experience our project received as a very positive indicator of both regulatory and community support this helps us progress without delay towards a mining lease and keeps us on our tight timetable to begin

metallic element its atomic number is  making it the lightest of the transition metals scandium is not particularly rare  its occurrence in crustal rocks is  around ppm  this makes scandium generally more abundant than lead mercury and precious metals despite this fairly common occurrence scandium rarely concentrates in nature  it does not selectively combine with the common oreforming anions so time and geologic forces only rarely form scandium concentrations over  ppm there is currently no dedicated single mine source and it estimated that only  tonnes of scandium are produced globally each year   scandium exists in nature in its oxide form  it is very difficult to reduce to its pure elemental state in fact it was not isolated in pure form until  and the first pound of pure elemental scandium metal was not produced until   scandium in oxide form is referred to as scandia or scandium oxide and the chemical formula is sco  processed scandium oxide a white powder is stable at ambient temperature and is the standard scandium form for commerce despite scandium’s scarcity and high cost interest in the metal is high and multiple high value commercial uses have been developed  of particular interest is the alloy of scandium into aluminum metal products  when used in combination with other common aluminum alloys scandium can produce stronger more corrosion resistant heat tolerant weldable aluminum products  aluminum products are being increasingly incorporated into transportation applications aircraft and automobile in order to meet fuel efficiency requirements    aircraft manufacturers are particularly interested in scandium alloyed aluminum materials aircraft designers believe use of alsc alloys can reduce aircraft weights by   in addition the ability to employ weldable structures promises similar cost reduction potential  scandium also exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity and heat stabilization qualities and the largest volume current use is in solid oxide fuel cells “sofcs”  incorporation of scandium in sofcs enables a lower operating temperature resulting in longer lived equipment and less costly materials of construction  bloom energy is the leading sofc manufacturer and currently single largest scandium user alsc alloys may reduce aircraft weights by  numerous other applications have been identified and are under research most notably high intensity lighting “stadium lighting” and high voltage power transmission and additive layer parts manufacturing “d printing” overview opportunities scandium alloy fact sheet scandium faq

market development insider actions – purchase – sale  – number of transactions aeronautics much of the alloy development that took place in the ussr appears to have been intended for aerospace applications one alloy  is used for fuselage stringers of large cargo aircrafts and some parts of the mig  military aircrafts are also made of sccontaining alli based alloys it is also claimed that some parts of the international space station iss are made from alloys with sc aircraft manufacturers have been particularly interested in scandium alloyed aluminum materials aircraft designers believe use of alsc alloys can reduce aircraft weights by  in addition the ability to employ weldable structures promises similar cost reduction potential the three principle effects that can be obtained by adding scandium to aluminium alloys are grain refinement during casting or welding precipitation hardening from alsc particles grain structure control from alsc dispersoids addition of scandium in combination with zirconium is particularly effective which gives us a chance to mention alkane which is in close proximity to both the projects in nsw the table below shows graphically the eight major series of aluminium alloys as can be noted all of them provide aluminium with a strength push when combined with scandium in an alloy the two that show the greatest benefits are with pire aluminium and in alloys with aluminium and magnesium source scandium international a little goes a long way with scandium in alloys small additions of the metal to an alloy can produce a quantum benefit in strength for a relatively low cost in many cases the sc added to the alloy master mixes is a fraction of a percent of the total metal the effect though is massive in lowering the weight of the plane and thus the fuel costs of operating the plane the stronger the aluminium the less than needs to be used the problem the aircraft manufacturers face in adoption of scandium alloys en masse is not one of price or desirability it is of supply with no primary mines and no sizeable supply there could at some point be an absolute absence of scandium supply for either competition reasons or geopolitical considerations boeing going to the storage division and finding no scandium for that day’s production would effectively shut down operations only with a largish stable supply from a politically friendly jurisdiction can a wholesale adoption of scandium in aeronautical applications be considered for the first time since  this possibility can be realistically contemplated solid oxide fuel cells a solid oxide fuel cell or sofc is an electrochemical conversion device that produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel fuel cells are characterized by their electrolyte material the sofc has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte advantages of this class of fuel cells include high efficiency longterm stability fuel flexibility low emissions and relatively low cost scandium’s usefulness for sofcs is that it exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity and heat stabilization qualities and therefore the largest volume current use for the metal is in sofcs scandium is used as the electrolyte component in the fuel cell most commonly as scandia stabilized zirconia scsz below can be seen a conceptualization of how these fuel cells work with the electrolyte containing the scandium being the dark grey layer incorporation of scandium in sofcs enables a lower operating temperature resulting in longer lived equipment and less costly materials of construction bloom energy in the us is the leading sofc manufacturer and currently the single largest scandium user the fuel cells are massed into stacks to match the energy required so the potential is enormous and once again limited only by the reliable supply of scandium rather than any lack of potential end demand conclusion scandium is the example par excellence for our thesis of “build it and they will come” in the aeronautics industry in particular tooling up for a different mode of manufacturing or input can be a massive cost running into the hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions it is clear that the industry wants to apply the benefits that scandium brings but it is not going to go out on the limb and hope that the adage “build it and they will supply us” proves to be true as we all know that train is heading down the track fullspeed towards tesla that has foolishly failed to secure its supply of cobalt and lithium for the future the likes of boeing and airbus are not so naïve thus when a significant supply of scandium is guaranteed then the synergies between aeronautics and scandium mining will come into play and the uptake of product will be potentially enormous that in itself will trigger more realistic and workable pricing and in turn that will feed greater uptake beyond the aeronautical industry into those with more sensitive price points such as lighting and fuel cells scandium international is well positioned to do this as a primary mine and potentially clean teq will be able to follow with its sizeable byproduct credit of scandium from a nickelcobalt production facility it also seems that australia and most specifically new south wales will be the epicentre of scandium activity for the short term and maybe even farther into the future this in some dusty pub in the australian pub in the outback will find that betting on either or both of those flies will pay off note from the assistant publisher george putnam president and ceo of
