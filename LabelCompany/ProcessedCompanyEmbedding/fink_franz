media and telecom conference in new york on may  we hope to see many of you there i would now like to turn the call over to franz franz fink welcome and thank you for joining us this afternoon on todays call we will review our first quarter  financial performance and business outlook recent significant announcements and progress with our strategy starting with a brief comment on financials we came in favorably on all fronts versus our previous guidance coming in at the top end of the range for revenue and gross margin and to bottom end of the range on operating expense dave will provide additional color on the financials later in the call however i want to emphasize that we are on track to achieve our q  financial goals of near  gross margins and breakeven adjusted ebitda let me now provide you an update on progress with our strategy last quarter we laid out the three strategic imperatives that our team has been diligently working to put in place to recap these include first to maintain our leadership position and expand market share with our highvoltage product line which provides foundational cash flow and the opportunity for steady longterm growth second to narrow our ultracapacitor market focus and optimize our portfolio investments to drive diversification achieve scale and transition the business to higher growth opportunities with the nesscap acquisition as a key ingredient of this strategy and third to leverage our revolutionary dry battery electrode technology by establishing partnerships with industry leaders in automotive and energy storage to unlock new applications maxwell which could generate significant future revenues in a massive multibillion dollar market the latest significant step we have taken which we announced last month was a strategic investment of approximately  million in maxwell from chinas sdic fund management company which we expect to close in q  after cfius review and other customary closing conditions are met with significant investments in two leading chinese battery companies sdic is expected to enhance our access to chinas largest automotive battery companies which makes our strategic partnership important to maxwells hybrid capacitor and dry battery electric proliferation strategy this sdic relationship is also anticipated to deepen our existing china localization strategy in one of the largest and fastest growing energy storage markets for transportation and grid we anticipate that investment from sdic will significantly strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capital necessary to make investments in our strategic technology development programs and demonstrate long term sustainability to our customers and large dry battery electrode partners i will discuss this important accomplishment in greater detail later in the call now i will update you on our progress with each imperative starting with our high voltage product line our strategy is to intersect the paradigm shift happening now in the global high voltage market particularly in the united states china and india with the goal to grow revenue and foundational cash flow over the next five years as discussed last quarter we introduced several new products last year which are now showing increasing demand among them are a customized capacitor to support transient events exceeding norms in complex electrical substations which is an innovative design that improves robustness in the highaltitude capacitor for applications higher than  meters which permits the electrical grid to cross higher mountains until now capacity constants have limited our revenue potential for highvoltage products to about  million annually to eliminate this constraint this year we embarked on a factory expansion which will enable by  about  million in revenue annually in the  million addressable market we are on track to complete the factory expansion and be ready for production by the beginning of  our second imperative is to drive diversification achieve scale and transition our business to higher growth opportunities with our ultracapacitor products acquiring the operating business of nesscap has been a critical strategic milestone to this imperative i am happy to report that we closed this transaction on april  as planned the strength of our now combined product portfolio will significantly increase our global market presence and opportunity pipeline particularly in europe and asia the nesscap best in class small cell product portfolio combined with maxwells leadership in large cell solutions will meet the short and long term needs of the automotive grid wind and industrial markets with an increase in rd capability and operational efficiency we hope to better enable our customers in these markets with the most competitive value which we expect will enable their next generation differentiating solutions our top priorities for integration are to further build out our near and longterm pipeline enabled by a comprehensive optimized product portfolio to capture operational and technological synergies and to improve manufacturing efficiency and time to market of our new innovative products we have also made great progress with restructuring we announced in q and combined with nesscap synergies we are no track to achieving the savings we projected now that the acquisition has closed we are charging forward on integration with our larger team including specifically the strengthening of our manufacturing footprint by increasing scale through our new operational capabilities in korea turning to our current business i would like to provide a short update on each of our markets including bus auto grid rail and wind i will start with bus where we are on track with our partner in china crrcsri to localize manufacturing of our ultracapacitor base modules and expect to be ready for production in the fourth quarter as discussed last quarter we are conservative in our revenue assumptions for  with minimal revenue contribution from china bus and an expectation that meaningful growth would resume in  we do think there is an increasing possibility for upside in q of this year as we are seeing new demand in china bus as we can meet very aggressive short term pricing and volume requirements that could lower our overall gross margins but still would improve ebitda we are working with multiple customers and should be able to provide more definitive information in our next earnings call moving next to auto our pipeline of opportunities continues to be driven by applications in startstop eactive suspension electric turbo and backup solutions for a number of functions we continue to work with our customers and partners on an increasing number of opportunities with a total of  confirmed designins at various stages of progress and in several different application our team continues to make tremendous headway and continues to engage deeply with both existing and new automotive customers further validating our premise that increasing demands of vehicle electrification drives an increased need for capacitive energy storage products as evidenced by our growing opportunity pipeline i want to reiterate our belief that inflection point in this market will occur in late  next i would like to discuss grid and rail in grid we continue to gain momentum with several pilot projects including one we have discussed in the past with a lead global oem on a system design where we are making very strong progress on the pilot program that we expect to result in a longterm commercial agreement and first system deployment in  driven by our portfolio of differentiating new products we are seeing increasing interest from new potential customers in our solution we are working on an increasing number of opportunities in our growing pipeline of design opportunities is setting the foundation for revenue rent in late  early  timeframe in rail our lithium capacitor or lcap partnership with crrcsri is progressing nicely with initial pilot scale volume shipments continuing to gradually ramp throughout this year we are collaborating with our partner to establish high volume manufacturing capability as well as working on second generation product and will provide an update on the progress later this year lastly let me update you on wind where we saw q tracking slightly higher than anticipated we expect a typical q with seasonal growth and demand driven by china wind and we expect this strength to carry into q as chinas wind market continues to solidify and slightly grow ongoing curtailment of electricity generation remains a challenge for wind power projects however the china government has indicated that they are working to resolve transmission and associated infrastructure bottlenecks likewise we anticipate slow and steady project development growth in europe and emerging regions for the remainder of the year as the price of wind energy decreases and becomes more cost competitive for both offshore and onshore installations moving to the third strategic imperative which focuses on our dry battery electric technology i would like to discuss more about our new and exciting partnership with sdic first this alliance enables leverage in regards to our ability to control our ip in the future we now have a partner who believes so much in our team and in our technology that they are willing to invest  million in the company the capital from the financing is expected to enable us to make future investments in technology and assets with a reliance solely on funding from partners and to put us in a better position as we move down the path to commercialization of our dry battery electrode technology second based on sdics relationships on the ground in the industry in china this partnership will likely open up opportunities for strategic collaboration as sdic has significant investments in chinas energy storage industry including two of the top battery companies and several major system integrators in the new energy market as well as leading oems in the china auto and grid industries this substantial presence in china should also help deepen our china localization strategy china continues to be very important to maxwell thus having a partner with an extensive network in the region is a very valuable asset further to that point one of the global automotive companies currently working with us on our dry battery electrode technology proof of concept was very positive about sdics relationships with high volume battery manufacturing from a technology advancement perspective our team is steadily making progress with our partners on our dry battery electrode joint development project this quarter we achieved several critical performance criteria capacitance resistance efficiency porosity ph with our dry battery electrode technology and demonstrated our ability to process meters and meters of electrode on rolls of both the battery anode and cathode using our existing pile of scale infrastructure meeting yet another significant milestone towards high volume commercialization this independent accomplishments confirms that high volume production is feasible and that our technology is scalable our team is now preparing to produce larger rolls with our partners to build higher capacitor cells for electric vehicle platform validation as we near completion of the proof of concept and consider future joint developments and commercialization efforts we are seeing continued interest from three additional parties as well as increasing interest from others all of which are large brand name global players in the energy storage and automotive industries given our recent successes with the proof of concept and the growing interest from several global leaders we expect to make more progress both independently as well as through broader collaboration and commercialization agreements towards the end of  and into  before i hand the call over to dave i want to say that i am very proud of our teams accomplishments of the past three years since i started at maxwell we began by shifting our very broad market focus to a more targeted investment approach we restructured the organization to reduce operating expense by about  consolidated our ultracapacitor factories into your state of the art facility in peoria arizona to help protect gross margins sold our nonstrategic microelectronics product line for about  million to bolster the balance sheet and enable us to bridge to our  inflection point we refreshed our high voltage product portfolio and we are in the process of increasing the capacity in our high voltage factory this year to enable maxwell to capitalize on our leadership position in a market paradigm shift impend it facilitate revenue growth and solidify foundational cash flow for ultracapacitor we prioritized our investments created critical development partnerships including signing our china business localization partnership with crrcsri we realigned our cost to match the current forecasted business and with the closing of the nesscap acquisition solidified our ultracapacitor portfolio to achieve scale and enhance mid to long term growth as it has become a priority for our organization we remain determined to leverage and to gradually shift key investments into our breakthrough dry batter electrode technology to capitalize on the significant upside opportunity in the longterm to that end we signed a joint development agreement with the leading global automotive oem and tier one supplier on the proof of concept to validate pilot volume dry battery electrode performance targeting a specific electric vehicle platform in  most recently we initiated a highly strategic partnership with sdic in china which is expected to enable better access to key china battery companies with these strategic imperatives behind us or in process we believe that we now have the necessary pieces of the strategy in place and our focus is on executing next strategy to ultimately drive longterm profitable growth and shareholder value i would now like to turn the call over to dave to discuss our financial results david lyle thanks franz today i will discuss our q results our outlook for q with a little commentary about  as a whole as well as  and recent announcements starting with q our first quarter revenue was  million at the top end of our guidance range of  million to  million driven by higher sequential ultracapacitor revenue mainly in the wind market somewhat offset by lower high voltage revenue ultracapacitor revenue was  million and high voltage capacitor revenue was  million nongaap gross margin in q was  at the high end of our guidance range of  to  driven by a favorable product mix and slightly improved factory utilization q nongaap gross margin excludes  of stock based compensation expense nongaap operating expense for q was  million at the lower end of our guidance range q nongaap operating expense excludes  million of stock based compensation expense  in restructuring costs  in transaction cost associated with the nesscap acquisition and  in costs related to certain legal matters q nongaap net loss was  million resulting in a net loss per share of  gaap net loss was  million for the quarter gaap net loss per share was  based on a basic share count of about  million shares q adjusted ebitda was negative  million and unadjusted ebitda was negative  million q tax expense was approximately  million our q cash balance was about  million slightly above our guidance target of  million dsos for the first quarter were approximately  days and inventory turns were  times now i would like to talk more about nesscap and provide guidance for the second quarter of  we closed the acquisition of nesscaps operating business on april  as planned our team is now executing on our integration strategy there is a lot of work to be done but we feel confident that we have solid plans in place to achieve the anticipated synergies that we identified in diligence which include margin expansion through economies of scale and material cost savings improved revenue growth and diversification through an expanded product portfolio and indiscernible expansion as well as backend operational cost savings in q we expect net cash revenue contribution to be about  million reflecting contribution from twothirds of the quarter with nongaap gross margin from this revenue to be in the range of  to  we expect nesscap to add an additional  to  in nongaap operating expense in q but expect to offset this operating expense with benefits generated from our restructuring efforts executed last quarter as a result we expect nesscap to be accretive in q please note that as a base line for revenue modeling going forward if we close the transaction on april  and received a full quarter benefit from nesscap we would have expected to see contribution of  million to  million in revenue in q we have plans to fully integrate nesscap into our ultracapacitor business and as such we will not present operating metrics specific to nesscap in our earnings releases going forward thus for q results and q guidance nesscap revenue will be included in overall ultracapacitor revenue and gross margin and operating expense will be included in overall maxwell numbers that we report moving to overall q guidance we expect maxwells top line revenue to grow by  at the midpoint of the guidance range of  million to  million driven by significantly stronger organic ultracapacitor revenue primarily in the china wind market and that includes about  million partial quarter revenue from nesscap i q we expect nongaap gross margins to be slightly down sequentially at  plus or minus  basis points we believe that we are able to maintain gross margins around  because higher utilization in our peoria factory is offsetting pressure from higher ultracapacitor revenue despite that pressure we believe we are on track to meet our goal of raising corporate gross margins back to historical levels nearing  in q of this year we anticipate excluding about  in inventory stepup due to the acquisition of nesscap and  in stock based compensation expense from q nongaap gross margin we expect q nongaap operating expense including nesscap to be in the range of  million to  million slightly higher than q which reflects the addition of the nesscap business offset by savings we achieved from our restructuring in q we estimate our q nongaap operating expense will exclude approximately  million in stock based compensation expense  million of transaction related cost associated with the nesscap acquisition and approximately  associated with sdic sec and investor related legal matters we expect our tax expense in q to about  million mostly associated with taxes on income of our swiss subsidiary at the midpoint of guidance we expect q nongaap net loss per share to be  and gaap net loss per share to be  based on a basic share count of about  million shares which includes the weighted average impact of  million shares issued in the acquisition of the nesscap business at the midpoint of guidance q adjusted ebitda is expected to be about negative  million and unadjusted ebitda is expected to be negative  million in regards to cash we expect our cash balance at the end of q to be in the  million to  million range depending on working capital changes and collection from a large customer this guidance includes  million in expected nesscap acquisition cash transaction related costs which offset expected favorable working capital changes now turning to the reminder of  and beyond we are on track with our china bus localization partner crrcsri in building out their factory in china obtaining the applicable localization certification and readying our products for production in the fourth quarter as franz mentioned earlier we have conservatively forecasted minimal revenue from china bus in  however we are working on an upside opportunity that has the potential for increased q revenue and corporate gross profit but that could negatively impact gross margins due to aggressive pricing requirements we hope to be able to provide more clarity next quarter as we move further along with our customers for  in china bus we still expect to see revenue growth that should ramp as the year progresses in  we expect that auto will continue to remain on a solid revenue run rate with growth still expected in the latter half of  at our anticipated inflection point keeping with our prior guidance we also expect nominal growth in  from both grid and rail with the inflection point in those markets to commence in late  going into  also please note that we expect to see additional revenue from the nesscap acquisition in the auto wind and industrial markets for our ultracapacitor products for maxwell as a whole i would like to reiterate that we are on track to meeting our prior guidance and nearing  gross margins breakeven adjusted ebitda in q of this year lastly i would like to provide additional color on our recent announcement of our collaboration with sdic fund management company we signed a stock purchase agreement whereby sdic is anticipated to purchase approximately  million common shares for  per share which equates to an investment of about  million before transaction cost and subject to closing conditions including cfius revenue and necessary approvals from the relevant chinese governmental authority we expect this transaction to close in q and following the closing sdic is expected to own roughly  of maxwells total issued and outstanding shares of common stock and will have the right to appoint representative to the maxwells board of directors additionally sdic will be subject to an  month lockup period in which they will be unable to sell the stock and a  month standstill period in which they will be limited in purchasing additional ownership of maxwell without our approval we intend to use the proceeds from the investments for normal operating activities for the agreement the funds are to be used for strategic development as well as working capital and general corporate purposes with this strengthening of our balance sheet we plan to make incremental investments in select technology development programs including our dry battery electrode technology development program where we see substantial future opportunities now i will turn the call back to franz for closing comments franz fink thanks dave over the last three years the team at maxwell has been working hard to assemble the pieces of a strategy with a fundamental goal to create profitable longterm growth diversify the business and ultimately generate value for our shareholders i feel that the main components of the strategy for high voltage ultracapacitors and dry battery electrode are in place and now we are focused on executing that strategy make no mistake we still have work to do but i feel confident that maxwell is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead of us i am looking forward to updating you in future quarters on the progress we will have made operator we are now ready to open the call up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question is from jeff osborne from cowen jeff osborne congratulations on the strong results and outlook just a couple of questions on my end i wanted to better understand the dynamics that play with the fourth quarter potential kind of mini surge it sounds like of bus is the gating factor the factory that crrc is building or qualification with customers product from that plant i just want to understand what the dynamics are to see that potential happen franz fink yes thanks jeff thanks for the question let me start a little bit more broadly just to reemphasize that what we are seeing here is that the localization strategy and agreement we have been putting in place is working as of this while we are in the midst like dave pointed out bringing up the factory getting through certification bus customers have been coming back to us and asking our help in helping them developing optimized solutions in the short term that certainly would be with the existing products in the midterm what they have been telling us that as subsidies go away in  we believe that the ideal solution is plugin hybrids with ultracapacitors or even electric vehicles protected by ultracapacitors now again that requires more in the mid to long term optimized solutions now as far as your fourth quarter question is concerned certainly there is demand with respect to building buses there is quite some pressure system cost and system cost pressure with respect to that that on the one hand looking at solutions leveraging more costly power batteries versus on the other hand combining cheaper energy batteries with ultracapacitors and in that context of course we are looking into what can we do to help them on the one hand from optimizing the system from an overall cost ultracapacitor system cost standpoint and then of course yes to your point bringing up the factory and getting the certification of course needs to be happening in a timely fashion too and that’s why as of today while this is all happening and we are seeing here some encouraging signals we have some work to do and of course we also are very carefully looking into what conditions should we take on that shortterm business that is based on existing products to get back into those systems to set up really a more healthy and a bigger business in the mid to long term and again at this point in time we remain on the conservative side like we have done in the last quarter but wanted to let you all out there know that there is really encouraging signs that there might be a shortterm upside opportunity but particularly in working in the mid to longterm opportunity as well jeff osborne that’s helpful and just to i guess to make sure i understood what i think you are trying to emphasize on the prepared remarks that the upside in revenue while it may be dilutive to gross margins but still target the breakeven ebitda so there wouldn’t be any risk to that if this were to happen but essentially the  target for gross margins will be the issue franz fink yes right we would be prepared to go as aggressive in view of the mid to long term very healthy business to some of the gross margin but not breakeven ebitda levels yes jeff osborne got it okay that’s helpful and then just as we think about  i know you are not giving formal guidance but with those dynamics at play for buses ahead of the subsidy expiration in  i would imagine that would be quite strong i guess just how would you encourage the investors to think about the margin profile of that business with the crrc plant up and running in  is there going to be like a second generation of products that might be more cost optimized for china which then would improve the margins or would the bus make still be a drag on gross margins but obviously a big boom to top line and ebitda franz fink i would look at this administer ph conservatively only from a standpoint we obviously involve developing with our partners next generation products we are trying to get them out as early as possible however you know on how those things could go not necessarily even on our side new buses with optimized systems need to be developed if they would come into play by end of  would be great but if they move into  that certainly could have meant to in that context i would look as an investor that we would be prepared to take on here business again in the context that it might be impacting gross margins but clearly contributing to cash flow and ebitda as we go through  as far as the significance of said revenue is concerned again we pointed out earlier in the call we have more to share in the next earnings call but as just initial fuel we would like to look at this more on the conservative side and not get too excited yet at this point in time jeff osborne that makes sense maybe just a couple of modeling questions assuming the sdic deal goes through are the mechanics of that that total  million of cash roughly would show up at the end of q and then we should think about a q share count kind of in the  million to  million range i am just trying to understand what the dynamics are as we model that out david lyle yes depending on  this is dave jeff depending on when we close will determine the weighted average share count but you are right i think by the time we enter q if we close this in q we will be in the  million share range in terms of the cash inflow of  million its gross and it also could be subject to some small adjustments depending on where the share price is at that time but generally speaking  million is what we are shooting for and then there is some transaction cost we will have to pay out of that jeff osborne and then shall we assume  assuming the swiss subsidiary runs at this level throughout the year or maybe moderate growth at the tax rate or the tax expense sorry of  million a quarter should that be consistent throughout the year every quarter or is there any ups and downs on that david lyle i think it depends on the quarterly revenue but i think generally speaking in the million dollar range per quarter is kind of a good model jeff osborne got you and then is there any way franz that you can talk about roughly outside the stop start how many vehicles you expect to exit  on the road and the  on the road i fully recognize the  design wins or revenue opportunity late in  and any more in the  but is there any just based on your understanding how many vehicles you will exit this calendar year that have launched and exiting  that have launched franz fink yes i think just at a high level out of course the platforms we have been mentioning there is a few of them in  there is clearly i would say the remainder of those few going towards half of the  towards end of  maybe a little bit more and then the other one into early  and in  that’s how i would look at that at a high level jeff osborne okay that’s helpful and then i assume there is no update on this that’s my last question but you havent mentioned on the past couple of calls corning and the development work there is there any update there assuming no since you didn’t mention it but when should investors expect some type of update or commercialization of a potential product or testing that you could share franz fink yes very good question jeff we are still making good progress there on the technology front and on that front generally so a higher capacitance and a higher temperature is likely as pointed out in the past in development and we will have updates there in the not too distant future it might not be next quarter but its progressing nicely and its still very critical technology for particularly for automotive but not solely for automotive operator operator instructions we have no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to the presenters franz fink all right well again thank you all for joining today dave and i are looking forward talking to all of you here over the next hours and days to come and again we are going to attend the cowen conference at st of may in new york

portion of the call i would now like to turn the call over to franz franz fink welcome and thank you for joining us this afternoon on todays call we will review our third quarter  financial performance and discuss our business outlook starting with our third quarter results we achieved revenue of  million with nongaap growth margin of  the timely completion of all aspects of the worldwide organizational restructuring we announced last year along with our continued focus on increasing operational efficiencies allowed us to make another large improvement in our operating expenses to  million also we met our financial objectives for the quarter revenue and profitability remain a challenge during the transition of our business in the near term is continued on certainty remained in both the china bus and wind markets on our last earnings call we shared with you a number of critical strategic initiatives we prioritized to help us navigate through these nearterm challenges and to transition our business to a very large longterm higher growth market opportunity we have identified manufacturing and supply connections that will further streamline our business and improve our cost structure in the future we are diversifying our bus and wind product lines into other markets and we are working to establish a strategic partnership with a large brand name market leader to better position us in china we are also expanding our portfolios strategic development partnerships to ensure we sufficiently invest in our innovation engine to expand our technology platform to build and expand in sales pipeline and ultimately drive accelerated business growth we also shared more information about our new dry battery electrode technology that we believe has ability to drive further business diversification and if successful has the potential to analog new applications address a significant market opportunity and change the technological landscape for new target markets as we move rapidly forward into a more electrified world we achieved our financial objectives in the third quarter and im very pleased with the great progress we are making with our strategic initiatives to solidify and diversify our business with progress in both design and activity as well as our partnership strategy our confidence is growing that we have significant future growth opportunities here at maxwell to that end let me now update you on the progress we are making on our key strategic initiatives in our key addressable markets i will discuss the following seven markets in order china bus auto truck grid energy rail wind and high voltage ill start first with the china bus market the chinese government has still not formally announced additional changes to its subsidy program for buses however on the positive front we have recently received demand inquiries from several of our china bus customers for both our volt as well as our new volt bus modules based on our new volt technology as we are not highly confident that these will ultimately translate into deliveries in q you will see that we have not reflected this revenue in our q revenue guidance we previously disclosed that we had signed an moi or memorandum of intent with a large chinese partner to enable us to address potential china government localization requirement and to further strengthen our position into china new energy power a storage market we have made significant progress in solidifying that partnership agreement and believe we will sign a definitive agreement by early next year we expect this to reignite our china bus market revenue in  and allow us to generate revenue into seasonally strong second half of the year we are optimistic than an extended partnership combined with our technology leadership and new volt phase modules positions us very well to capitalize on the growing chinese energy storage market for bus great rail and other applications moving to the auto market we still believe this market holds the greatest longterm growth opportunity for our ultracapacitors and we remain confident that the market inflection point is in the  time frame the electrification of functions and internal combustion engine cars such as powering electric turbo chargers eactive suspension and start stop which includes emergency backup systems has increasing power demands many of which we believe cannot be supported reliably by batteries alone our work with oems and q suppliers in developing solutions for multiple platforms is beginning to show promising results we have a total of  car model designs at various stages of progress and for various applications several of those have already launched and others are at a stage where ultracapacitor technology has been proven and platform development is under way we now have four auto design wind shifting in volume and seven additional auto designed winds that are targeting launches between now and  we believe that by  we will have at least  to  car model design winds generating meaningful revenue from maxwell lets review these designs and applications in more detail first is the start stop application we have design winds with psa cadillac ats cadillac cts and cadillac ct those are going well and provide a steady revenue base second we are seeing very good traction with maxwell ultracapacitors and eactive suspension applications for new car model designs as a reminder the eactive suspension application using maxwell ultracapacitors is mainly targeted at active roll control or arc which delivers automatic individual wheel control over bumpy surfaces for riding comfort improve body control and improve chassis response making handling easier on any road condition we are very excited about our existing design winds for eactive suspension as well as recent design activities underway each of these designs begins in the lower volume volt system luxury auto segment of the market we previously announced that we had a design wind launch this year as a standard option in a very small volume high end luxury suv more recently our partners have seen design wind activities which are giving us increasing confidence in the proliferation of the eactive suspension application using maxwell ultracapacitors we have recently won two additional car model designs in low volume  model year luxury sedans as an upgrade option one began shipping last month and one will begin shipping next year in addition to the confirmed design winds i just mentioned we now have strong indications that two additional car models are planned to include this feature as an upgrade option for launch in late  or  furthermore there are three additional design evaluations under way for lower priced higher volume  or  models with the possibility to be a standard feature in one or more of those models as with eactive suspension we are also seeing continued momentum with our designing activities for powerchallenging application that i have shared with you on previous calls – electric turbos or eturbo solutions as the global auto oems are facing significant challenges to meet very stringent future mission regulations they are accelerating their development efforts to increase electrification across their fleets we are very excited about the traction we have with several customer projects aimed at downsizing the internal combustion engine and complementing it with an electrified turbo charger in order to maintain the engine performance while significantly lowering fuel consumption and emissions we have been working very closely with our oem and tier partners to develop a costefficient energy and power delivery solution for this very power demanding application and i am cautiously optimistic that we should be able to share more about the progress we are making with this application as we move to the evaluation and validation phases this broadbased progress and design activity highlights our increasing confidence that maxwell has a strong value proposition for the automotive market and we continue to expect this will drive additional growth beginning late  or early  and in a much larger way by  turning to truck with kenworth peterbilt and the third major oem as our engine start module partners we are seeing a modest uptake in revenue however due to the fragmented and diverse truck market we continue to believe that the revenue contribution from truck will be small until a significant number of fleets have gone through the independent qualifications and the aftermarket is sufficiently penetrated now turning to grid maxwells pilot projects continue to make progress in demonstrating the power capability and longterm reliability of ultracapacitors as a great energy storage solution either alone or as part of a system along this batterybased energy storage in q we anticipate the commissioning of an additional pilot system to form solar output on a commercial micro grid in conjunction with bosh and the california energy commission more importantly we are excited to now see the launch of our first large scale development effort with a major global oem to address transmission level power quality issues and anticipate a growing pipeline of project as a results of the success in the coming years given the typical long deployment cycles we believe  will be the revenue inflection point for this opportunity in multiple project and we expect that a number of commercial projects will gradually increase in  and beyond as our opportunity pipeline grows we are making excellent progress and bringing the technical and financial benefits of ultracapacitor energy storage to commercial reality and believe that our great product lines has the potential to become a significant contributor in the three to fiveyear horizon turning to our rail markets last month we announced that maxwell ultracapacitors are being used for regenerative breaking energy storage in the beijing subway system the first commercial subway wayside project for crrcsri and mexico and china additionally our partnership with crrcsri to codevelop solutions uniquely designed to address a rapidly growing chinese rail market continues to progress in other areas as well earlier today we announced that with our partners crrcsri we have developed the next generation costefficient energy storage solution with the power characteristic of an ultracapacitor combined with enhanced energy storage capacity called an lcap or lithium capacitor crrcsri has won an lcap design for trolleys with one of the worlds largest make of train solutions for an onboard energy storage product the first demonstration trolleys have successfully completed initial test for the changsha subway in changsha hunan and volume shipments are expected to ramp next year although this is not a large volume opportunity by itself it is validation of our product and we expect to proliferate into further commercial opportunities beginning in  we are excited about this new technology as it further broadens our technology platform and we see additional long term growth opportunities in industrial automation moving to the wind market although we have seen nearterm challenges from our largest revenue market in china due to recent government intervention a number of new designs utilizing ultracapacitors have come to markets and we are seeing an increasing trend for large offshore and remote wind turbines that require extended life and reduced maintenance the chinese governments recent initiatives will put pressure on our wind revenue continuing into q and possibly  due to grid capacity constraints and to meet for improved infrastructure to support and deliver power when needed however we continue to expect the wind market to remain one of our most material revenue contributors in  and we are actively pursuing new opportunities and designs with global leaders outside of china to diversify our wind business and to drive additional growth in  and beyond lastly our high voltage revenue has picked up momentum and we saw strong sales throughout the quarter largely driven by the increased infrastructure investment by the chinese government that was announced as part of its new fiveyear plan back in march we expect revenue from our high voltage capacitor products to continue to be a material revenue and cash flow contributor to our business shifting to progress on our dry battery electrode technology development that we shared in our last call we are gaining confidence that this technology can provide a foundation to open up a new market and drive long term growth we are adapting our proprietary dry electrode technology primarily to focus on next generation batteries for electric vehicles and plugin hybrid vehicles by applying our fundamental dry electrode manufacturing technology to lithium ion batteries we can create significant performance and cost benefits for the market with the automotive industry on the verge of a paradigm shift towards electrification global players and automotive and battery industry are seeking differentiators to set them apart as leaders in this new frontier we now have agreements with two major auto market players and several parties continue to evaluate our technology previously we announced that we signed the  months joint development agreement with one of the worlds leading automotive oems to develop a proofofconcept that if successful could lead to the worlds first electric drive train based on our technology targeting  automotive platform launch we are working in this jointlyfunded program with our partner to complete proofofconcept around electric vehicle design and expect to enter into a broader collaboration and commercialization agreement if the concept is proven in  the program is progressing well and together with our partner we reach an important first milestone in accordance with the plan furthermore we are excited to announce that we are expanding to twoparty agreement to include an thirdparty a leading global tier  auto supplier who will join us on this strategic profile this further validates the technology as a potential game changer in the industry and the address is a significant new market opportunities as automotive industry most rapidly forward into a more electrified growth before i turn the call over to dave let me reiterate that are focused efforts to advance our business diversification strategy in the transition to higher growth opportunities is progressing well even as we sustain to income revenue challenges we have made significant progress in solidifying key partnerships some of which we expect to be formally announced early next year which we expect will position us for resumed revenue growth in the second half of  and beyond we believe we have some right new products innovations and partnerships that will deliver significant value for our customers and our shareholders in the years ahead i would now like to turn the call over to dave to discuss our financial results dave david lyle thanks frank third quarter revenue was  million within our guidance range of  million to  million and down sequentially by  million as the chinese government slowdown in wind turbine installations impact in the quarter ultracapacitor revenue was  million and high voltage capacitor revenue was  million nongaap gross margin in q was  within our guidance range at  to  and about flat with q q nongaap gross margin excludes  stock based compensation expense nongaap operating expense for q was  million a  sequential decrease and within our guidance range of  million to  million approximately half of the improvement in operating expenses was due to the absence in q of operating expenses associated with our microelectronics product line which was sold in q and about half was due to continue belt tightening measures internally and rd funding for dry battery electrode partners q nongaap operating expense excludes  of stock based compensation expense and approximately  in legal fees associated with the ongoing secscpa investigations other expenses about  for the quarter and q adjusted ebitd was  million negative and unadjusted ebitda was  million negative q tax expense was  q nongaap net loss was  million resulting in a net loss per share of  based on a basic share count of approximately  million shares gaap net loss was  million for the quarter gaap net loss per share was  our q cash balance was about  million and we expect the cash balance to be back in the  million range in q as working capital changes normalize csos for the third quarter were  days an inventory terms were  times now id like to provide guidance for the fourth quarter of  q we expect maxwells top line revenue to again be in the range of  million to  million this guidance range assumes no revenue contribution from china bus in q as our customers are still waiting to receive formal guidance from the chinese government in the case where a positive statement is issued in q we could see up to a  million upside to our guidance range from china bus revenue however we are taking a conservative stance and have not included any china bus revenue in the guidance range we expect our high voltage revenue to increase by approximately  million sequentially into offset sequential declines from old capacitors and the china when market as we enter a seasonally soft quarter we expect nongaap gross margin for q be down slightly versus q in the range of  to  as we expect sequentially lower utilization in our ultracapacitor factory to be somewhat offset in a more favorable next shift toward our high voltage product line we anticipate excluding from q nongaap gross margin  in stock based compensation expense we expect q nongaap operating expense to be in the range of  million to  million we estimate our q nongaap operating expense would exclude approximately  million in stock based compensation expense and  of legal costs associated with the sec and scpa matters we expect our tax expense in q to be about  mostly associated with taxes on income from our swiss subsidiary at the midpoint of guidance q adjusted ebitda is expected to be about  million negative and unadjusted ebitda expected to be  million negative at the midpoint of guidance we expect a cue for nongaap net loss per share of  based on a basic share count of about  million shares gaap net loss per share at the midpoint of guidance is expected to be  with regard to our cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter we expect cash to be up from q at about  million depending on working capital changes taking a high level look at  we believe that we will continue to feel pressure through the first half of  mainly because a typical seasonal softness in both the china bus and win market we expect that our agreement with a large local partner coupled with customer adoption of our new products well drive revenue growth in the china bus market in the second half of  wind market revenue should seasonally resume in the second quarter of  however we expect that annual revenue maybe down overall additionally auto will continue to remain a solid and meaningful revenue contributor as we prepare for additional growth in  and beyond we expect grid and rails to both grow nominally in  and begin an inflection point in  in summary we continue to work through near term challenges in china but believe we are successfully executing on our strategy to navigate those challenges while maintaining the longterm prospects for the company now turn the call back to frank for closing comments franz fink thanks dave the maxwell team did a tremendous job in the third quarter executing on our mission critical initiatives that will build longterm value for our shareholders we are excited with the progress we made in our china localization effort when announcement is expected soon our automotive design and activities across various applications which are gaining momentum the first commercial development is a great market moving towards commercial ramp in  the expansion of our technology platform was our first commercial real deployment using jointly developed ultraproducts with our strategic partner crrcsri and our dry battery through technology development with a global tier  joining a proof of concept agreement in further validating the game changing performance potential of our technology we have a focused and motivated team in place here at maxwell and i remain very excited about the opportunities ahead i look forward to working with the team as we execute our strategy with the ultimate goal of maximizing value for our shareholders operator we are now ready to open the call up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well take our first question from noah kaye with oppenheimer please go ahead your line is open noah kaye thank you and good afternoon just wanted to just want to make sure to sort of that we understood the implications of your comments on the revenues cadence so are you basically seeing under this first half of  really a drop of revenue in the business should we start to see revenue growth in adjusted  into  and how confident are you that some of these auto designs programs are going to be the key driver there or are you assuming a significant recovery  interesting then demand for china bus as we look into  franz fink yes i know i thanks for the question let me clarify and start with  all what we are saying is said as you know seasonally in first quarter with this chinese new year and even in second quarter a china bus is always very low ended seasonally strong and in third and fourth quarter and we need is obviously seasonally soft in fourth quarter and first quarter and stops to ramp into second quarter and third quarter so thats all what we try to say with our comment that obviously wed be moving in first and second quarter into those quarters with some of our key businesses are seasonally softer the other businesses of course automotive like dave pointed out rail and grit remain very solid throughout and now coming to  sorry  like i pointed out in the call today there is multiple things that are coming into play certainly excellent traction we have in automotive market so first large scale development project is a global industrial yam ph on a grit firming capability that combines batteries with ultracapacitors that will start to roll out in  and going to its first commercial deployment these obviously several opportunities in  and then gradually so opportunities will in increase from there similarly with our programs youre making in rail we will see here an initial ramp with our new technology in  and that will gradually continue to increase in  as far as to wind market is concerned i would like to emphasize said we have been focusing outside of china we have been here securing design wins in us as well as in europe which key players not just for new wind terms turbines but we also stopping to see some interesting momentum this retrofits we operators in order to lower and maintenance costs are stopping to look into replacing batteries with ultracapacitor solutions and this obviously provide an additional growth opportunity for us as far as china bus is concerned just to also compliment here the markets we are moving ahead with the localization despite the fact that the chinese government has not announced a new subsidy this is going extremely well again as you pointed out we expect to hear an announcement early next year and in parallel we have started with our partners to put everything in place from the new products we have developed qualifying those new products establishing infrastructure from manufacturing to customer facing activities subset as subsidies communicated we are prepared with or without localization requirements to rolled out our new products in  to make sure that as the market obviously stops to grow into seasonally strong quarters q and q we are designed in with our products and to most of our bus customers we had designed in a today are we going to past noah kaye okay thank you very much that color next may be a question on the announcement that you made today looking that in tandem with your previous announcement about the jda with the other partner can you help with understand to what extent you are retaining of protecting your ip as we now look at taking the proprietary dry electrode from process into a new application involved neither looking my on electrode portion in there or some combination therere kind of traditional architecture how are you protecting  and are you comfortable that you can position the platform to protect that thank you franz fink yes very good an important question a lot so let me just maybe first just a little bit draw for summarize on how those partners come here into play i have shared on previous calls that key oems and tier  suppliers and even selfsuppliers look at the electric drive train including energy storage solution as core of as a future electric vehicle just looked like an internal combustion engine into power train in the car is today in that context our globally impact now brings all a system knowledge including obviously building electric vehicle here had to the party helping us like pointed out to validate our technology in the context of an electric drive train system thats where its a global tier  comes in that has been obviously looking at developing electrical motors electrical drive trains and combining it with energy storage capability to really have differentiated capability for electric wheel vehicles and plug in hybrid electric vehicles forcing years   and beyond we are in that project here with our technology and we have structured that where maxwell is set pretty much focused on underlying technology the underlying materials and a dry battery electrode technology as well as volume manufacturing aspect of it and in the context of we have made sure that some agreement is structured such said that pip also underlying dry electrode battery a technology and manufacturing capability and associated ip remains with maxwell david lyle yes i like just add to that and now we have terms of ip protection we have over  patent applications worldwide on the dry electric process itself we feel like were well protected there and before we announced we and started talk public more publicly about dry electrode more specifically we spent  making sure that we shore up our patent portfolio as well as tested so we feel pretty good that were protected here noah kaye great thank you i will jump back in queue operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from craig irwin with roth capital partners please go ahead your line is open craig irwin good evening and thank you for taking my questions first of all thank you very much for the broaden discussion of this success with indiscernible and a little bit more visibility on the programs that are you working on for the next few years and where you feel youre ready had the wins so congratulations on porsche even though i know you wont say that name im and some of the other very high profile programs that are coming down the pipe doctor fink my question is about lithium ultracapacitors my understanding is that the announcement you made today is not the only active program where you are testing product in the field i understand there could be a couple or few so i was hoping that you might be able to give us a little bit of color on that and then one of the things that ive been discussing with my clients is how lithium ultracapacitors already use materials that are commoditized very similar to whats out  whats been commoditizing that battery industry so we wont have the same issues of very expensive carbon on the frontend and like we did a number of years ago on the introduction of ultracapacitors can you maybe talk through the cost structure of lithium ultracapacitors and what that means for potential market adoption rates as we are as we look at this product potentially being commercially launch in the next couple quarters franz fink yes thanks for the question craig with respect to the lithium capacitors in general in your market questions and additional projects i will say in this call that much as we already referred to in our call its clearly with our partner has one aspect of being uniquely designed and optimized for on border electrocution to hire energies efficiently enough powered by light weight obviously is important but certainly thats not the only application that we are looking at so in that context you could guess that we are involved in various stages with the technology without the applications i referred to some in industrial automation you also could think about a backup power capability but at this point in time i would not like to go a year in more details now as far as cost structure is concerned in synergy with ultracapacitor is when with battery dry electrode program that we are embarked on with our jda ph partners you can look at lithium capacitor technology as follows as you look at one extreme its ultracapacitor was higher  highest power but you know energy overtly density is limited our lithium capacitor technology basically doubles or triples the energy in the capacitor with pretty much keeping the power not at the same level but it significant levels more than half of the power now as you look at particularly here the inner side of things and what you could do to make sure that you dont have just like in like in lithium ion batteries not the first a cycle of energy and looking to a litigation  prelitigation capability and i dont want to going to more details for obvious reasons not to give a too much of a with the right process you can imagine that could be fairly easily established as we do that we believe because we can take the lithium capacitor and ultracapacitor capability into what you would call it generally a hybrid capacitor that could hopefully over time as we continue to advance and innovate keeps the power as close to an ultracapacitor but takes the energy in such a capacitor four to five times further up on what our lithium capacitor has today if you would succeed to do so we believe that would be a capacitor that would be in the sweet spot powering  of applications we see in any market you could look at and as you know cost is obviously important so we are coming there from a dry process and the cost structure that we from a building a capacitor or building a cell if you will from an ultracapacitor manufacturing standpoint but as energy goes up you need less cells for the whole energy storage solution and in doing so obviously you could significantly lower the system cost for any of source energy storage systems of for any applications you target does that kind of answers your question craig irwin yes that does thats very good so then as a followup many investors would love to see maxwell profitable and making money but your advanced technology programs like this are obviously a medium term and longer term investment can you maybe share with us the  million plus in rd that youre spending this fiscal year can you share with us approximately what portion of that is going to support existing ultracapacitor products and the engineering and development of new generation on existing products versus some of the more advanced technology advanced applications where we havent sold the products in volume yet franz fink craig for obvious reasons i hope everyone on the call understands i dont want to go into too much details but let me offer up the following our rd investment is structured such if we have a very significant portion on of course our next generation ultracapacitor technology like the volt i can mention heres a corning ph program helping us of with some of the next generation material science higher performance lower  higher capacitance a lower cost high a temperature very important for automotive programs with more to come like i shared in the last call of the next   months we are looking into leveraging ultracapacitor and for this matter hybrid composite of technology for all the great programs developing here complementary energy storage capability to complement batteries just like the large scale program with a big globally as i mentioned today and of course the lithium capacitor and advancement of this with our partner were working on with our chinese partner to further advance this and then of course to mention and not to forget but to mention the battery dry electrodes program so i think that what i would say is that lots of our investment is still to a significant extent on advancing ultracapacitor technology as we have significant traction here automotive wind and grit on the other hand we also are making sure that we with battery dry electrodes the lithium capacitor and advancement of the hybrid capability we are spending sufficiently enough with the help of partners but keeping the key ip at maxwell to advance sad ph so if your question then really is how much are we spending on just maintaining normal type of product yes as always of course some age but i would say we have been shifting with the focus we have put the last two years of investment on developing so now what you started to see come out this year with this we wont know with the lithium capacitor and more to come in  but really focus on so now and the future with lots of different innovative capability coming out over the next  to  month craig irwin thank you for that and then last question along this line maxwell has some recent experience and commissioning new manufacturing your arizona facility was obviously a very successful launch and a nice impact on the companys operating cost structure as far as being able to produce high volumes at the right price can you discuss whether or not they would be similar or different timelines for maxwell to start putting production online of lithium capacitors not just low rate production but medium or high volume production and whether or not there are any complexities around the capital needs of the capital requirements to launch full scale production versus your experience in the arizona facility franz fink yes craig we have gone into too much detail of the partnership that we announced here and basically a year ago we are working here with a partner that helps us to optimize the technology particularly in this case for on border real applications and in that partnership we are also making sure that we in line with affordability will bring up the first volume production line and as we expand into new and additional markets beyond real and this initial lines is basically fully utilized we would look into in building lines that are maybe you know solely owned ultimately further down the road by maxwell so again were taking here an approach with the help of a partner have the volume capability the right cost available can leverage that manufacturing capability and would expand beyond this as we are going into for the market beyond real craig irwin great thanks again for taking my question operator thank you and well go on and take our next question from jeff osborne with cowen  company please go ahead your line is open jeff osborne just a couple of quick ones for me one on the dry electrode process that youre working out with the auto oem is that exclusive to the oem or if you choose to proceed is there an opportunity to sell that to others franz fink at this point of time the agreement is structured offset that there is no exclusivity and the ip as i pointed out stays with maxwell and in that context we can pursue other opportunities jeff osborne got it and then you mentioned that i think that the nru ph funding helped the expenses this quarter you have  how do we think about what the funding cadences for  and is there a significant amount of opex thats being defrayed by this that we should be thinking about as we model you gave some context about how we should think about the cadence of the revenue ramp through the year but any commentary on opex if you think this kind of you know loader to mid twelves ranges sustainable or as revenue picks up what the pace of opex increase would be helpful also franz fink yes so maybe jeff i make a broader  i give a broader runs on opex in the context said first of all i command team for the job they have done to get us to the level theyre this today as we are moving in to  we are always continuously looking into what else we can optimize having this said we are looking at the right partnerships that help us invest in our innovative products and solutions and in doing so even though lets say more work would need to be done we would basically keep operating expenses at lets say pretty much at current levels what i dont want you to read into it yet again is that with the help of some of that funding that its just going to go right significantly down because with some of those programs additional work will come having this said we are very much focused to make sure our operating expenses are in the remaining control and will do so as were moving forward in context with those partnerships just an additional comment we are very much focused here to invest in innovation engine and protective value of our products of our technology platform and to value for our shareholders jeff osborne very good that makes a lot of sense and the last question i have is just around the new partnership and localization in china so just hypothetically speaking at the bus market were to come back how do we think about the margin profile of that business with your new strategy relative to past cycles in the china bus market franz fink i think you should look at that such said you should see somehow in at improved marching profile just from a standpoint that as you take an approach where you have less one in between product being manufactured and then ultimately bought back and resold was margins on top to have a competitive product you could easily see and how that puts us somehow higher margin pressure we think we will see what the new strategies some relief offset additional marchings stacking an ends ph we saying it will see somehow improved margins jeff osborne make sense and maybe just one point clarification on that what i may have missed  theres a tremendous amount of detail on this call but what exactly is being localized in china i assume youre still making electrode yourself in arizona and then package shipped within just a final assembly thats in china franz fink at this point in time whats localized is a bus module manufacturing that at this point in time electrode remains in peoria arizona cell manufacturing is under maxwell was a partner in the maxwell leadership bus module manufacturing we are localizing here in initial step with a partner working very closely with them again more to be disclosed as we would obviously share so definitive agreement that we believe of we will be able to sign early next year jeff osborne and its just so clear lucshane ph i think was your partner in the past for cells who was making that the module in the past franz fink well we have  we really havent on the various partners but system module nhlap cells ph where with our partner about in china jeff osborne okay thank you very much i appreciate it operator thank you and well go ahead and take our next question from john ph question cannacord please go ahead your line is open unidentified analyst hi good evening thanks for taking my question first on the ultracapacitor revenue i guess declines on the winter by market in china that whatever was  million yearonyear change or excuse me for a quarteronquarter change q q can you size the amount of the market that you feel is being delayed for you is that  million run rate per quarter how do we think about the amount of business potentially delayed in china with us franz fink no john again thanks for the question no you cannot quite look at this because remember we had a very  electrode ever quarter in china wind in that the second quarter because with that fic a plan back in march they announced significant additional funding and gigawatt hours coming on over the next five years in the five year plan pins our customers were stopping to accelerate building wind turbines just that figuring out in the middle of the second quarter that they didnt have the infrastructure to bring them all online and of course then so co  also had some impact additionally to slow that down in some of solution so in that context our revenue was significantly higher by millions and millions in second quarter versus a normal even stronger seasonally  seasonal strong a second quarter so you need to really look at this said releases delta from a normalized second quarter into a third quarter the decline is actually significantly less than that  million in fact it its actually below  million i dont want to go into more detail but that could still your flavor that its over compounded by the fact that happens here was to flush announcement in march overbuilding and then basically slowing it down unidentified analyst okay thank you thats helpful and then moving to my followup question in terms of the rd spend i think someone touched on earlier this  million run rate if you will is that static were going to be around  million across the different applications you have or how should we think about this moving forward is this a leverage potently safe if need be in  thank you franz fink yes again thought i hoped that i can see here some conviction that team has shown that we have a focus on trading expense and we do what needs to be done to protect the evaluation and value for shareholders in that context i think at this point in time yes that how you should look at it we will make sure that we put the company in a stronger context of partnerships like we have done we are making progress the same we will continue to focus on it now again having this said in case we would have to look at this as we are moving forward we certainly would look at this and look at alternatives to make sure to protect the value of our technology platform and of our business and in that context the value of our shareholders operator thank you and that does conclude todays program wed like to thank you for your participation have a wonderful day you may disconnect at any time franz fink okay again thanks for joining today looking forward to talking to
