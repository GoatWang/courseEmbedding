patient info referrals careers newsevents home what is manual therapy what is manual therapy share this  many patients friends and family all ask the same question when they hear the term “manual therapy” what is it who does it what is it good for why doesn’t everyone do it we hope shed some light and answer these frequently asked questions right here manual therapy is often defined slightly differently depending on the medical professional’s scope of practice whether an osteopathic doctor do a chiropractor or a physical therapist in the physical therapy field manual therapy is utilizing skilled handson techniques including but not limited to manipulationmobilization used by the physical therapist to diagnose and treat soft tissue and joints to reduce pain increase range of motion decrease myofascial restrictions to improve muscle length decrease swelling or inflammation assist the body in muscle or soft tissue repair extensibility andor stability and facilitate movement to improve function whew thanks to wikipedia for some assistance with that definition that’s a whole lot of words but manual therapy is really a large umbrella under which many specific handson techniques reside here’s a list of the manual therapy techniques we could come up with we still may have missed a few soft tissue techniques massage manual lymph drainage soft tissue mobilization functional mobilization scar mobilization myofascial release strain counterstrain craniosacral therapy active release technique art feldenkrais graston joint techniques joint mobilization joint manipulationthrust muscle energy techniques mulligan techniques traction while some of these techniques are not as wellknown or common as others most of us have experienced some type of manual therapy in our lifetime getting a massage is one of the best selfrewarding treats you can give to most individuals anyone who has seen a chiropractor most certainly has experienced one of these types of manual therapy and who hasn’t given someone a chair massage to reduce stress and headaches if you think about it frequently humans will unknowingly rub their skin or fidget some other way to selfsoothe during a stressful moment during the day just ask a body language specialist why is the sense of touch so soothing we know that massaging premature babies improves their health just like rubbing a fussy baby’s back can reduce the pain felt from gas injury or teething when a toddler trips and falls he gets up immediately and finds his mom for the allimportant hug and kiss to make the booboo feel better the benefits of touch are many from soothing a hypersensitive nervous system improving sleep patterns and boosting the immune system when manual therapy is used in a physical therapy setting we know that scars become painfree soft tissue restrictions melt away and joint motion improves a physical therapist can help reduce edema perform techniques to control lymphedema and unload joints to reduce pain even during the most ordinary orthopedic treatment of stretching a joint to improve motion for what type of injuries or problems is manual therapy helpful  heres a partial

importance in physical therapy treatment rather it is more like the spoon you need to eat your ice cream you could try other ways to eat a sundae from a dish but none of them would be as easy smooth enjoyable or as effective as using a spoon the same can be said for manual therapy you can certainly find physical therapists who do not use this approach but you will never know if you could have overcome your injury faster or reached a higher level without the assistance of a manual physical therapist it’s kind of like trying to change the oil in your car without that all critical oil filter wrench to loosen the old and tighten the new filter you’ll still have fresh oil but it sure is a lot harder takes a lot longer and without a new filter why just change the oil it’s leaving the job incomplete so is physical therapy without any handson techniques so why doesn’t every physical therapist do manual therapy techniques i would venture to say that just about every physical therapist does some sort of manual therapy technique at one time or another but why not use it whenever it could be of assistance in the rehabilitation process it takes a lot of time handson learning and skill to become adept at performing the most complex manual therapy techniques to be able to assess the problems with soft tissues and joints with your hands alone without the assistance of imaging soft tissue and joint restrictions are not typically visible in most imaging anyway other than the new and rare tool of musculoskeletal imaging takes a special ability to feel these difference in tissue consistency this is both a gift and a combined motor and sensory skill that takes time and patience to master that perhaps not every practitioner can or chooses to pursue this is one of the reasons why we tell patients to give motionworks physical therapy a try even if you have not had success with physical therapy in the past we do things quite a bit differently here combining the best of handson manual therapy techniques with functional strength and stability critical for not only reducing pain but restoring your body to healthy and efficient movement patterns every physical therapist here is skilled and knowledgeable in this approach to physical therapy and every patient receives best in class care by people who really care experience the difference that a handson approach to

story patient info referrals careers newsevents home the motionworks story the motionworks story dr jill murphy was very happy with the first decade of her career having had an opportunity to practice as a physical therapist licensed athletic trainer and strength and conditioning specialist and then retire to practicing as just a physical therapist in a friendly hospital outpatient department when the first baby came along  however practicing part time without the ability to have a direct impact on changing and improving the care her patients received on a daily basis became a limitation  faced with the decision to continue with the status quo or move up into middle management and no longer treat patients handson dr murphy had to find another option that allowed for continuous improvement of the patient experience while still treating patients on a daily basiswhile treating for ten years in several hospital systems outpatient physical therapy departments dr murphy recognized that physical therapists could offer so much more to patients if not restrained by bureaucratic red tape that serves as a barrier to change in larger insitutions  things like being open early to treat patients at a time that wont make them late to work or force patients to use vacation time or lunch time to attend physical therapy  private treatment rooms and comforts like dimmer switches in rooms where patients are lying on their back staring into bright lights when being treated for things like migraines and chronic pain  care provided by one physical therapist for the whole visit and throughout the continuum of care without pressure to hand off patients to other providers with less training and experience  and what if a patient couldnt make it to the clinic on a weekday but needed to be seen  what if the patient experience could be enhanced with spalike surroundings relaxing music selected by the patient and a play area too keep kids occupied if needed during mom or dads visitbetter yet what if the general public could learn more about what physical therapists have to offer  what if moms knew that physical therapy could help eradicate daily headaches they have been suffering with for years what if the general public knew that physical therapists provide a complete treatment plan for low back pain and neck pain providing symptomatic relief and longterm solutions with manual therapy and stabilization exercises and prescriptive exercises designed to correct movement dysfunction to get rid of pain and keep it from coming back  what if people knew that physical therapits can treat tmj dysfunction balance issues and vertigo offering quick symptom relief and long term solutions  what if a physical therapy clinic could offer an urgent headache care clinic to give patients with headaches and migraines a valid alternative to the administer drugs and get patients out before the headache returns approach of emergency roomsso many little things little changes that could make physical therapy more available accessible and comfortable for patients  changes that just could not get done in larger physical therapy institutions  are what drove dr murphy to create a new pardigm for physical therapy  in a small physical therapist owned private outpatient physical therapy practice dr murphy was able to improve access to care with initial appointments in  hours enable marketing of unique services direct to consumers and provide physical therapy in a comfortable environment specifically designed to promote healing all while ensuring that every patient received the highest quality physical therapy services available in the fox valley  at the same time she also made many job shadowing and physical therapy student internships available for students wishing to learn more about the sports medicine and physical therapy profession  dr murphys philosophy in business is to ask why not or why cant we instead of finding excuses for not improving patient care recognizing that pursuing excellence in care is an ongoing endeavor motionworks physical therapy is open to change and making continuous improvements to continue meeting our patients highest expectations for their physical therapy carefive years later the fox valley community has discovered the unique patientcentered physical therapy services that motionworks has to offer recommending motionworks to friends and family neighbors and coworkers making motionworks physical therapy a resounding success motionworks physical therapy patients love their physical therapy care and look forward to physical therapy visits knowing they are trusting their care to the right hands and being treated in the right place  our physical therapists work every day to live up to these high expectations of individualized patient care and tailored treatments that go well beyond a simple protocol making dr murphys idealistic dream of what physical therapy could be a workable reality right here in neenah  thank you to our patients for entrusting us with the physical therapy needs for themselves and their families and to the physicians who have discovered our high quality personalized approach to patient care and
