you free updates as they’re published you’ll receive free email news updates each time a new story is published you’re all set sign up invalid email address got it got it by william h jones by william h jones february   back in the late s stock broker and investment adviser w b hibbs was giving his colleagues fits in talking to local investors and business people hibbs told them not to buy stocks any more stock trading had become just like gambling and something was wrong with the economy he advised partners in the hibbs firm talked of ways to silence the man who came to washington in the s and once sold newspapers on th street nw where a building bearing his name later was built hibbs founded a major stock brokerage and commodity trading firm in  and w b hibbs  co later became the first washingtonarea member of the new york stock exchange after the stock market crash in october  many customers of the hibbs firm never forgot the advice they got and their loyalty to the brokerage could never be broken internal criticism disappeared rather quickly things are not so bad today although the stock market continued on a very weak footing last week and ominous comparisons can be made with economic developments in the past year and those of  years ago indeed the  successors to leadership of the areas oldest major investment house are quite cautious about the current climate they are bullish about longterm equity markets and they are not out of the stock market completely but they are not investing much of their customers funds in stocks at the moment when shortterm interest rates are so attractive that it doesnt make sense to take risk in the stock market the company today is called folger nolan fleming douglas inc which has a family tree with two significant rootsthe hibbs company and a separate investment firm founded in  by john clifford folger and james parker nolan folger nolan combined with hibbs in  and offices were consolidated in the old hibbs building at  th st nw built in  in a coincidence both mr folger and mr nolan died last year exactly  years after they had founded their business each man had been in his th street office four days before he died the deaths of the board chairman and president of any business in such a short span of time normally would present major problems of corporate restructuring and invite questions about new goals for a different era but folger nolan has faced no such difficulties indeed a new management team at folger nolan has taken over and only emphasized anew the companys hallmark as a conservative investment house in a time of economic turmoil most of our customers have longterm accounts and they are on the conservative side mainly interested in longterm purchasing power plus a small percentage of investments in highgrowth areas said year old lee m folger son of john folger and new board chairman lee folger has been in the investment business since  and his family is the dominant owner of stock in the washington firm we have a conservative investment philosophy and are not interested in highlyspeculative gogo stocks    the markets will be increasingly volatile with big changes in a day or two and there is a need for constant attention to each customers portfolio he emphasized in an interview last week because of these constant changes folger said his firm is looking at new investment products for customers to help them maintain the value of their assets and to work on the more illusive goal of increasing purchasing power the political scene and climate has the potential for being very positive for business but the deficits are frightening    i hope there will be substantive discussions by congress and the reagan administration to reduce the deficits but until that develops we need to be cautious in investment of customers funds he added moreover metropolitan washington offers a special challenge to investment advisers in folgers view this is a fabulous town for this business because of the large number of twoearner families and one of the main problems people here face is converting income to assets to some extent this has led to a change in folger nolans emphasis the investment firm still thinks of itself as aimed at the top of the market in washington but top of the market used to be measured in the size of assets a customer had today top of the market also is measured by income since many investors or potential investors have large family incomes but not yet the overall assets to compete for the business of these washingtonians and to maintain existing specialties in retail stock brokerage municipal finance and corporate finance lee folger is joined by two longterm colleagues in a senior management group robert w fleming known throughout the local community as bus fleming has been named president to succeed the late mr nolan fleming joined the firm in  and became a general partner in  he was added to the firms name in  when it became known as folger nolan flemingw b hibbs  co the douglas in the current name of the firm is that of w leslie douglas a new senior vice president a brokerdealer since  douglas had been a vice president of the company for more than  years and his name was added to that of the firm in  other top officers named include john p rodler senior vice president secretary and treasurer and thomas roddy robert leahy h montgomery snyder lillian blucher and james mersereau senior vice presidents in terms of capital folger nolan ranks first among washington area investment firms total stockholders equity as of last sept  was  million the firm has about  customer accounts  employes including  registered sales representatives and just one small branch office in northern virginia virtually all operations are done under one roof in the old hibbs building which is being renovated inside other area investment firms have more customer accounts but folger and fleming emphasized they are not seeking to be all things to all people for example the firm does not put its clients into commodities at one time folger nolan had a membership in the chicago board of trade and it was a big commodities trader in earlier decades but no more fleming emphasized that his firms investment philosophy does not in any way mean that only wealthy persons can be served to the contrary where some investment firms discourage persons with only small amounts of money folger nolan emphasizes retail activity and seeks all customers i have a feeling that for a person with  to invest its more important to him than for a person with  to invest said fleming a theme for many many years has been personalized service no matter how big the initial account he added for individuals couples and institutions with substantial assets and income folger nolan established a capital management division in  to conduct research and to manage a broad range of investments there is a minimum annual fee of  for this service and the company says that the benefits of investment management can best be realized where portfolio values approach or exceed  folger nolan is an active participant in stock underwritings and periodically a major investment banker in this area when opportuntities open up two of the largest deals in washington business history took place in the past decade and folger nolan was investment banker for both joe l allbrittons purchase of the now defunct washington star and his surprising but successful bid for control of riggs national bank with more such takeovers and financial institution consolidations taking place in the next few years folger said everything is possible when asked if his firm would move into other business lines or find itself a target for acquisition but he emphasized we feel very strongly that theres an important place for locallybased locallycontrolled investment firms in the nations capital    major banks and investment firms should not be just branches of firms elsewhere with decisions made elsewhere his firm has a capital position among the strongest in the industry and since folgers family controls ownership his goal of continued independence is assured business get  olympics updates by email our best news and analysis from rio delivered to your inbox postnewsletter magnetolympics false afterth false please provide a

regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the
