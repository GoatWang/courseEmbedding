the name wikicities which invited comparisons to geocities but changed its name to wikia on march   in the month before the move wikia announced a us million venture capital investment from bessemer venture partners and first round capital nine months later amazoncom invested us millioncitation needed in series b funding by july  it had more than  wikis in more than  languages over time wikia has incorporated formerly independent wikis that joined wikia such as lyricwiki nukapedia uncyclopedia and wowwiki gil penchina described wikia early on as the rest of the library and magazine rack to wikipedias encyclopedia the material has also been described as informal and often bordering on entertainment allowing the importing of maps youtube videos and other nontraditional wiki material by  wikias were able to be created in  different languages in october  wikia announced that craig palmer the former ceo of gracenote would replace penchina as ceo on february   cofounder beesley starling announced she was leaving wikia to launch a startup called chalkdropcom at the end of november  it was announced that wikia had raised another us million in series c funding from institutional venture

system to the new position of chief operating officer in december  wikia launched the fan contributor program on january   wikia launched a new entertainment news site named fandom on september   wikia announced that wikiacom would be renamed fandom powered by wikia on october   to better associate themselves with the fandom website wikia inc would remain under its current name wikiacom is now redirected to fandomwikiacom services and featuresedit wikisedit wikia communities consist of online encyclopedias each one specialized in a particular subject or theme although wikia allows almost anything to be the main focus of a wiki the most common interest of wikia internauts is in popular fiction franchises of books films games and other media due to the considerable limitation of such detailed information by wikipedias notability policies the main purpose of articles in a wikia community is to cover information and discussion on a particular topic in a much greater and more comprehensive detail level than can be found on wikipedia articles for example spiteful crow an enemy character in earthbound may have its own article on the earthbound wikia whereas the character may not be considered notable enough for a wikipedia page also the writing style is mostly directed to those familiar with specific vocabulary and terminology rather than to the lay and general public of wikipedia other examples of content that is generally considered beyond the scope of information of wikipedia articles includes wikia information about video games and related video game topics detailed instructions gameplay details plot details and so forth gameplay concepts can also have their own articles wikia also allows wikis to have a point of view rather than the neutral pov that is required by wikipedia although npov is a local policy on many wikia communities wikia requires all user text content to be published under a free license most use the creative commons attributionsharealike license although memory alpha and uncyclopedia use a noncommercial variant and some use the gnu free documentation licensenb  wikias terms of use forbid hate speech libel pornography or copyright infringement material is allowed as long as the added material does not duplicate wikimedia foundation projects wikis are not owned by their founders nor does the founders opinion carry more weight in disagreements than any other users opinion consensus and cooperation should be the primary means for organizing a community however wikia may take decisions affecting the community even if theres no consensus at all technologyedit the wikia file store as of june  includes over  million files stored on ssd as of august  wikia uses a heavily modified version of mediawiki software based on the version  of mediawiki which was officially marked as obsolete in may  it has more than  extensions installed most of them created by their staff of developers to add social features like blogs chat badges forums and multimedia but also remove features like advanced user options or skins other than their default custom skin and monobook available only for personal use in august  wikia announced it would switch to a service oriented architecture it has also removed many custom extensions and functionality for specific wiki has created certain features to fill those needs entertainment news magazineedit in  wikia launched fandom an online entertainment news magazine the program utilizes volunteer contributors called fan contributors to produce newsstyle articles working alongside an editorial team employed by wikia in contrast to the blogging feature of individual wiki communities fandom focuses on pop culture and fan topics such as video games movies and television shows the project features fan opinion interviews with property creators reviews and howto guides fandom also includes videos and specific news coverage sponsored or paid for by a property creator to promote their property in september  it was announced that the entire wikia platform would be rebranded under the fandom name on october   private marketingedit wikia currently runs the wikia fan studio a private platform that allows property creators to give early exposure to their product to a select group of wikia users all participants remain anonymous and are required to sign a nondisclosure agreement to keep early access information confidential fan studio features properties such as testing for games early releases of television episodes a chapter of a book etc the purpose is to create an environment to market a property to a demographic who immensely enjoys pop culture topics collect feedback and gauge interest of the topic on the internet wiki partnershipsedit wikia has created several official partnerships to create wikis vetted by the corporation as being the official encyclopedia or wiki of a property in  wikia partnered with roddenberry enterprises to create the trek initiative a wikia hosted wiki community site that features video interviews promotions and other material about star trek to celebrate its th anniversary in  wikia partnered with soe now called daybreak games to create official wikis for several of their games such as free realms planetside  and the everquest franchise wikia made similar partnerships with k games during the launch of civilization beyond earth and warner bros interactive for shadow of mordor wikia also has partnerships with lionsgate media to promote starz and film franchises through wiki content fandom articles and advertisements controversyedit wikia communities have complained of inappropriate advertisements or advertising in the body text area there is no easy way for individual communities to switch to conventional paid hosting as wikia usually owns the relevant domain names if a community leaves wikia for new hosting the company typically continues to operate the abandoned wiki using its original name and content adversely affecting the new wikis search rankings for advertising revenue domain and skin assimilationedit wikia has sometimes expanded by acquiring an existing wikis domain name user lists and databases from a founder or cofounder in return for money and stock options the original wiki is then shut down without consulting its editors or wider community and the domain redirected to wikias version of the project in the case of the acquisitions of uncyclopediaorg from jonathan huang in july  gamewikisorg from phil nelson in october  and memoryalphaorg from harry doddema and dan carlson in january  the content was under a noncommercial license in june  wikia adopted a new skin monaco intending to implement it as the default on almost all hosted wikis many wiki users felt the choice of skin default should remain their own the switch went ahead but some wikis retained monobook as their default in september  the transformers wiki moved content to their own server citing the formataltering ads and mandatory changes as reasons for their departure wikifur moved likewise in august  the nethack wiki moved in november  and the doom wiki in september  in may  wikia removed the ability of individual users to choose a skin other than monaco or monobook claiming a testing burden and relative lack of features soon after wikia removed the option to set the default skin to monobook with the exception of certain large wikis namely uncyclopedia relationship with wikipediaedit wikia has been accused of unduly profiting from a perceived association with wikipedia although wikia has been referred to in the media as the commercial counterpart to the nonprofit wikipedia wikimedia and wikia staff call this description inaccurate in  the wikimedia foundation shared hosting and bandwidth costs with wikia and received some donated office space from wikia during the fiscal year ending june   at the end of fiscal year  wikia owed the foundation us in june  two members of the foundations board of directors also served as employees officers or directors of wikia in january  wikia subleased two conference rooms to the wikimedia foundation for the wikipedia usability initiative according to a  email by erik möller deputy director of the wikimedia foundation we obtained about a dozen bidswe used averaging as a way to arrive at a fair market rate to neither advantage nor disadvantage wikia when suggesting a rate the averaging also resulted in a rate that was roughly equivalent to the most comparable space in the running relationship with wiki communitiesedit wikia often implements new features or branding choices which individual wiki communities disagree with and giving little or no customization options while there is usually mutual respect amongst communities and wikia sometimes forced implementation of features or branding has resulted in conflict wikia incedit wikia and wired building location wikia inc is based in san francisco california the company was incorporated in florida in december  and reincorporated in delaware as wikia inc on january  citation needed wikia has technical staff in the us but also has an office in poznań poland where the primary engineering functions are performed wikia derives income from advertising the company initially used google adsense but moved on to federated media before bringing ad management inhouse alongside wikias inhouse advertising they continue to use adsense as well as amazon ads and several other third party advertising services wikia additionally gains income from various partnerships oriented around various sweepstake sponsorships on related wikis wikia has several other offices international operations are based in germany and asian operations and

invited comparisons to geocities but changed its name to wikia on march   in the month before the move wikia announced a us million venture capital investment from bessemer venture partners and first round capital nine months later amazoncom invested us millioncitation needed in series b funding by july  it had more than  wikis in more than  languages over time wikia has incorporated formerly independent wikis that joined wikia such as lyricwiki nukapedia uncyclopedia and wowwiki gil penchina described wikia early on as the rest of the library and magazine rack to wikipedias encyclopedia the material has also been described as informal and often bordering on entertainment allowing the importing of maps youtube videos and other nontraditional wiki material by  wikias were able to be created in  different languages in october  wikia announced that craig palmer the former ceo of gracenote would replace penchina as ceo on february   cofounder beesley starling announced she was leaving wikia to launch a startup called chalkdropcom at the end of november  it was announced that wikia had raised another us million in series c funding from institutional venture partners and previous investors bessemer ventures partners and amazoncom another  million was raised in august  for series d funding with investors digital garage amazon bessemer venture partners and institutional venture partners the total raised at this point was  million on march   wikia announced its appointment of walker jacobs who was the former executive vicepresident of turner broadcasting system to the new position of chief operating officer in december  wikia launched the fan contributor program on january   wikia launched a new entertainment news site named fandom on september   wikia announced that wikiacom would be renamed fandom powered by wikia on october   to better associate themselves with the fandom website wikia inc would remain under its current name wikiacom is now redirected to fandomwikiacom services and featuresedit wikisedit wikia communities consist of online encyclopedias each one specialized in a particular subject or theme although wikia allows almost anything to be the main focus of a wiki the most common interest of wikia internauts is in popular fiction franchises of books films games and other media due to the considerable limitation of such detailed information by wikipedias notability policies the main purpose of articles in a wikia community is to cover information and discussion on a particular topic in a much greater and more comprehensive detail level than can be found on wikipedia articles for example spiteful crow an enemy character in earthbound may have its own article on the earthbound wikia whereas the character may not be considered notable enough for a wikipedia page also the writing style is mostly directed to those familiar with specific vocabulary and terminology rather than to the lay and general public of wikipedia other examples of content that is generally considered beyond the scope of information of wikipedia articles includes wikia information about video games and related video game topics detailed instructions gameplay details plot details and so forth gameplay concepts can also have their own articles wikia also allows wikis to have a point of view rather than the neutral pov that is required by wikipedia although npov is a local policy on many wikia communities wikia requires all user text content to be published under a free license most use the creative commons attributionsharealike license although memory alpha and uncyclopedia use a noncommercial variant and some use the gnu free documentation licensenb  wikias terms of use forbid hate speech libel pornography or copyright infringement material is allowed as long as the added material does not duplicate wikimedia foundation projects wikis are not owned by their founders nor does the founders opinion carry more weight in disagreements than any other users opinion consensus and cooperation should be the primary means for organizing a community however wikia may take decisions affecting the community even if theres no consensus at all technologyedit the wikia file store as of june  includes over  million files stored on ssd as of august  wikia uses a heavily modified version of mediawiki software based on the version  of mediawiki which was officially marked as obsolete in may  it has more than  extensions installed most of them created by their staff of developers to add social features like blogs chat badges forums and multimedia but also remove features like advanced user options or skins other than their default custom skin and monobook available only for personal use in august  wikia announced it would switch to a service oriented architecture it has also removed many custom extensions and functionality for specific wiki has created certain features to fill those needs entertainment news magazineedit in  wikia launched fandom an online entertainment news magazine the program utilizes volunteer contributors called fan contributors to produce newsstyle articles working alongside an editorial team employed by wikia in contrast to the blogging feature of individual wiki communities fandom focuses on pop culture and fan topics such as video games movies and television shows the project features fan opinion interviews with property creators reviews and howto guides fandom also includes videos and specific news coverage sponsored or paid for by a property creator to promote their property in september  it was announced that the entire wikia platform would be rebranded under the fandom name on october   private marketingedit wikia currently runs the wikia fan studio a private platform that allows property creators to give early exposure to their product to a select group of wikia users all participants remain anonymous and are required to sign a nondisclosure agreement to keep early access information confidential fan studio features properties such as testing for games early releases of television episodes a chapter of a book etc the purpose is to create an environment to market a property to a demographic who immensely enjoys pop culture topics collect feedback and gauge interest of the topic on the internet wiki partnershipsedit wikia has created several official partnerships to create wikis vetted by the corporation as being the official encyclopedia or wiki of a property in  wikia partnered with roddenberry enterprises to create the trek initiative a wikia hosted wiki community site that features video interviews promotions and other material about star trek to celebrate its th anniversary in  wikia partnered with soe now called daybreak games to create official wikis for several of their games such as free realms planetside  and the everquest franchise wikia made similar partnerships with k games during the launch of civilization beyond earth and warner bros interactive for shadow of mordor wikia also has partnerships with lionsgate media to promote starz and film franchises through wiki content fandom articles and advertisements controversyedit wikia communities have complained of inappropriate advertisements or advertising in the body text area there is no easy way for individual communities to switch to conventional paid hosting as wikia usually owns the relevant domain names if a community leaves wikia for new hosting the company typically continues to operate the abandoned wiki using its original name and content adversely affecting the new wikis search rankings for advertising revenue domain and skin assimilationedit wikia has sometimes expanded by acquiring an existing wikis domain name user lists and databases from a founder or cofounder in return for money and stock options the original wiki is then shut down without consulting its editors or wider community and the domain redirected to wikias version of the project in the case of the acquisitions of uncyclopediaorg from jonathan huang in july  gamewikisorg from phil nelson in october  and memoryalphaorg from harry doddema and dan carlson in january  the content was under a noncommercial license in june  wikia adopted a new skin monaco intending to implement it as the default on almost all hosted wikis many wiki users felt the choice of skin default should remain their own the switch went ahead but some wikis retained monobook as their default in september  the transformers wiki moved content to their own server citing the formataltering ads and mandatory changes as reasons for their departure wikifur moved likewise in august  the nethack wiki moved in november  and the doom wiki in september  in may  wikia removed the ability of individual users to choose a skin other than monaco or monobook claiming a testing burden and relative lack of features soon after wikia removed the option to set the default skin to monobook with the exception of certain large wikis namely uncyclopedia relationship with wikipediaedit wikia has been accused of unduly profiting from a perceived association with wikipedia although wikia has been referred to in the media as the commercial counterpart to the nonprofit wikipedia wikimedia and wikia staff call this description inaccurate in  the wikimedia foundation shared hosting and bandwidth costs with wikia and received some donated office space from wikia during the fiscal year ending june   at the end of fiscal year  wikia owed the foundation us in june  two members of the foundations board of directors also served as employees officers or directors of wikia in january  wikia subleased two conference rooms to the wikimedia foundation for the wikipedia usability initiative according to a  email by erik möller deputy director of the wikimedia foundation we obtained about a dozen bidswe used averaging as a way to arrive at a fair market rate to neither advantage nor disadvantage wikia when suggesting a rate the averaging also resulted in a rate that was roughly equivalent to the most comparable space in the running relationship with wiki communitiesedit wikia often implements new features or branding choices which individual wiki communities disagree with and giving little or no customization options while there is usually mutual respect amongst communities and wikia sometimes forced implementation of features or branding has resulted in conflict wikia incedit wikia and wired building location wikia inc is based in san francisco california the company was incorporated in florida in december  and reincorporated in delaware as wikia inc on january  citation needed wikia has technical staff in the us but also has an office in poznań poland where the primary engineering functions are performed wikia derives income from advertising the company initially used google adsense but moved on to federated media before bringing ad management inhouse alongside wikias inhouse advertising they continue to use adsense as well as amazon ads and several other third party advertising services wikia additionally gains income from various partnerships oriented around various sweepstake sponsorships on related wikis wikia has several other offices international operations are based in germany and asian operations and sales are conducted in tokyo other sales offices are located in chicago latin america los angeles marketing programming and content new york and london see alsoedit comparison of wiki hosting services

invited comparisons to geocities but changed its name to wikia on march   in the month before the move wikia announced a us million venture capital investment from bessemer venture partners and first round capital nine months later amazoncom invested us millioncitation needed in series b funding by july  it had more than  wikis in more than  languages over time wikia has incorporated formerly independent wikis that joined wikia such as lyricwiki nukapedia uncyclopedia and wowwiki gil penchina described wikia early on as the rest of the library and magazine rack to wikipedias encyclopedia the material has also been described as informal and often bordering on entertainment allowing the importing of maps youtube videos and other nontraditional wiki material by  wikias were able to be created in  different languages in october  wikia announced that craig palmer the former ceo of gracenote would replace penchina as ceo on february   cofounder beesley starling announced she was leaving wikia to launch a startup called chalkdropcom at the end of november  it was announced that wikia had raised another us million in series c funding from institutional venture partners and previous investors bessemer ventures partners and amazoncom another  million was raised in august  for series d funding with investors digital garage amazon bessemer venture partners and institutional venture partners the total raised at this point was  million on march   wikia announced its appointment of walker jacobs who was the former executive vicepresident of turner broadcasting system to the new position of chief operating officer in december  wikia launched the fan contributor program on january   wikia launched a new entertainment news site named fandom on september   wikia announced that wikiacom would be renamed fandom powered by wikia on october   to better associate themselves with the fandom website wikia inc would remain under its current name wikiacom is now redirected to fandomwikiacom services and featuresedit wikisedit wikia communities consist of online encyclopedias each one specialized in a particular subject or theme although wikia allows almost anything to be the main focus of a wiki the most common interest of wikia internauts is in popular fiction franchises of books films games and other media due to the considerable limitation of such detailed information by wikipedias notability policies the main purpose of articles in a wikia community is to cover information and discussion on a particular topic in a much greater and more comprehensive detail level than can be found on wikipedia articles for example spiteful crow an enemy character in earthbound may have its own article on the earthbound wikia whereas the character may not be considered notable enough for a wikipedia page also the writing style is mostly directed to those familiar with specific vocabulary and terminology rather than to the lay and general public of wikipedia other examples of content that is generally considered beyond the scope of information of wikipedia articles includes wikia information about video games and related video game topics detailed instructions gameplay details plot details and so forth gameplay concepts can also have their own articles wikia also allows wikis to have a point of view rather than the neutral pov that is required by wikipedia although npov is a local policy on many wikia communities wikia requires all user text content to be published under a free license most use the creative commons attributionsharealike license although memory alpha and uncyclopedia use a noncommercial variant and some use the gnu free documentation licensenb  wikias terms of use forbid hate speech libel pornography or copyright infringement material is allowed as long as the added material does not duplicate wikimedia foundation projects wikis are not owned by their founders nor does the founders opinion carry more weight in disagreements than any other users opinion consensus and cooperation should be the primary means for organizing a community however wikia may take decisions affecting the community even if theres no consensus at all technologyedit the wikia file store as of june  includes over  million files stored on ssd as of august  wikia uses a heavily modified version of mediawiki software based on the version  of mediawiki which was officially marked as obsolete in may  it has more than  extensions installed most of them created by their staff of developers to add social features like blogs chat badges forums and multimedia but also remove features like advanced user options or skins other than their default custom skin and monobook available only for personal use in august  wikia announced it would switch to a service oriented architecture it has also removed many custom extensions and functionality for specific wiki has created certain features to fill those needs entertainment news magazineedit in  wikia launched fandom an online entertainment news magazine the program utilizes volunteer contributors called fan contributors to produce newsstyle articles working alongside an editorial team employed by wikia in contrast to the blogging feature of individual wiki communities fandom focuses on pop culture and fan topics such as video games movies and television shows the project features fan opinion interviews with property creators reviews and howto guides fandom also includes videos and specific news coverage sponsored or paid for by a property creator to promote their property in september  it was announced that the entire wikia platform would be rebranded under the fandom name on october   private marketingedit wikia currently runs the wikia fan studio a private platform that allows property creators to give early exposure to their product to a select group of wikia users all participants remain anonymous and are required to sign a nondisclosure agreement to keep early access information confidential fan studio features properties such as testing for games early releases of television episodes a chapter of a book etc the purpose is to create an environment to market a property to a demographic who immensely enjoys pop culture topics collect feedback and gauge interest of the topic on the internet wiki partnershipsedit wikia has created several official partnerships to create wikis vetted by the corporation as being the official encyclopedia or wiki of a property in  wikia partnered with roddenberry enterprises to create the trek initiative a wikia hosted wiki community site that features video interviews promotions and other material about star trek to celebrate its th anniversary in  wikia partnered with soe now called daybreak games to create official wikis for several of their games such as free realms planetside  and the everquest franchise wikia made similar partnerships with k games during the launch of civilization beyond earth and warner bros interactive for shadow of mordor wikia also has partnerships with lionsgate media to promote starz and film franchises through wiki content fandom articles and advertisements controversyedit wikia communities have complained of inappropriate advertisements or advertising in the body text area there is no easy way for individual communities to switch to conventional paid hosting as wikia usually owns the relevant domain names if a community leaves wikia for new hosting the company typically continues to operate the abandoned wiki using its original name and content adversely affecting the new wikis search rankings for advertising revenue domain and skin assimilationedit wikia has sometimes expanded by acquiring an existing wikis domain name user lists and databases from a founder or cofounder in return for money and stock options the original wiki is then shut down without consulting its editors or wider community and the domain redirected to wikias version of the project in the case of the acquisitions of uncyclopediaorg from jonathan huang in july  gamewikisorg from phil nelson in october  and memoryalphaorg from harry doddema and dan carlson in january  the content was under a noncommercial license in june  wikia adopted a new skin monaco intending to implement it as the default on almost all hosted wikis many wiki users felt the
