the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of nexpoint credit strategies fund carefully before investing a prospectus with this and other information about nexpoint credit strategies fund may be found on our websites fund documents tab you may also obtain a prospectus by calling  please read the prospectus carefully before investing nonpayment risk senior loans like other corporate debt obligations are subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled interest andor principal nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to the fund a reduction in the value of the senior loan experiencing nonpayment and a potential decrease in the nav of the fund credit risk the fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in senior loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated senior loans deemed by highland to be of comparable quality securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “high yield securities” or “junk securities” they are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company’s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments investments in high yield senior loans and other securities may result in greater nav fluctuation than if the fund did not make such investments interest rate risk the fund’s nav will usually change in response to interest rate fluctuations when interest rates decline the value of fixed rate securities already held by the fund can be expected to rise conversely when interest rates rise the value of existing fixed rate securities can be expected to decline senior loans risk the risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities although senior loans are typically senior and secured in contrast to other below investment grade securities which are often subordinated and unsecured risk of restrictions on resale senior loans may not be readily marketable and may be subject to restrictions on resale as a result the ability of the fund to dispose of its investments in a timely fashion and at an advantageous price may be restricted ongoing monitoring risk on behalf of the several lenders the agent generally will be required to administer and manage the senior loans and with respect to collateralized senior loans to service or monitor the collateral closedend fund risk the fund is a closedend investment company designed primarily for longterm investors and not as a trading vehicle the fund does not intend to list its shares for trading on any national securities there is not expected to be any secondary trading market in the shares and the shares should be considered illiquid leverage risk leverage may increase the risk of loss cause fluctuations in the market value of the fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the net asset value “nav” of the fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise in the news
