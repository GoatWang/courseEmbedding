what will i do next how does retiring help me fulfill god’s purpose in my life how will i determine what my next chapter is the bible is virtually silent on the concept of retirement and makes no

proper planning and wise stewardship you may become financially free to use your talents and abilities to fulfill god’s next purposes for your life even after your primary career is completed in a robust economy many investors mistakenly believe that strong investment returns will continue and that there is no need to plan or save for a leaner future on the other hand some investors are so aggressive when it comes to retirement savings that they rob themselves – and their families – of opportunities to enjoy life and be generous toward others neither extreme is healthy – and neither

comprehensive and strategic financial plan is to be able to give generously helping clients with their plans for giving has been a central tenet of ronald blue  co since our inception – in fact because we have always considered it a focus of our services we’ve attracted many likeminded clients who have given hundreds of millions of dollars to philanthropic causes they give in the true spirit of sharing and experience the message of wisdom found in the biblical principle that guides us giving is key to becoming free from the power of money over our lives generous giving needs a strategic plan not just knowledge of the tax laws that govern “deductions” with wise philanthropic counsel your giving plan can help you  realize a deeper personal satisfaction from making a difference  gain a thorough understanding of the financial implications of giving  understand the strategies for giving assets in addition to giving cash  coordinate a giving strategy with your financial plan  feel confident that you are giving in a tax efficient manner  prioritize your passions and goals for philanthropy  most importantly we can help you benefit from the freedom and personal joy that giving generously brings to bear on the giver perspective “generosity and financial freedom are inextricably linked if you want to replace fear guilt and frustration with freedom confidence and joy you have

generous watch video it’s not what you earn that counts but what you keep after taxes with all of the tax laws and legislative changes how do you successfully navigate the complex always changing and confusing tax system more importantly how do you best take advantage of these changing laws in order to improve your financial stewardship and accomplish your goals benjamin franklin once said that “nothing is certain but death and taxes” despite yearly tax bills most individuals think about taxes only when they are filing their return “afterthefact” tax planning is often too late to take advantage of certain tax deductions credits and other tax planning strategies unlike tax preparation tax planning is a yearround process tax planning should be an important part of your financial plan but simply lowering or avoiding taxes should never drive or be the centerpiece of your financial plan instead consider tax reduction efforts in light of your overall goals for investing debt reduction

reasoning timebased portfolios team the primary investment benchmark we focus on your goals we believe the primary objective for investors is achieving the goals in their financial plans – because a financial plan is about so much more than just numbers at ronald blue  co managing investments is more about increasing the probability of your meeting your goals rather than competing against random benchmarks as part of your overall financial plan we start with understanding your personal needs and timeframe what are the resources with which you’ve been entrusted how do you want to steward them where do you want to go at what points in the future will you need those resources for where you’re going these are important questions because when you arrive at those points in the future you want to be sure the resources are available to fund those goals  we use a disciplined process for making investment decisions our philosophy is reflected in our proprietary principled reasoning® approach and our strategy is reflected in our timebased portfolios – all to help you reach the desired end result your vision for the future  we are also a firm committed to transparency and finding an investment plan designed to help you meet your goals within the constraints of available resources income potential risk tolerance and other factors our “open architecture plus” approach to selecting investment solutions takes advantage of both “off the shelf” solutions in the investment marketplace and customized solutions designed for our clients and although we exclusively recommend external investment solutions ronald blue  co has never accepted commissions from these investment product companies – and never will we believe that investing plays an important role in the overall stewardship process to help you provide for your family do good works and be generous watch video for nearly  years ronald blue  co has helped thousands of clients who are seeking to achieve financial peace of mind and meet their financial goals by applying technical expertise and biblical principles after the  financial crisis concerns over slow economic growth fiscal deficits and unprecedented central bank monetary policy highlighted the need for an investment decisionmaking process that helps to create financial peace of mind and assists in meeting clients’ financial goals in this new economic environment as a result we saw an opportunity to integrate our principles more systematically into our investment process with the goal of building more resilient investment portfolios this pioneering effort resulted in an investment decisionmaking framework known as principled reasoning® principled reasoning combines a deep understanding of timeless biblical truths sound knowledge of economies and investments rigorous global research and an indepth evaluation of risk dynamics rooted in six timetested principles this framework evaluates the investment landscape based on the economic environment growth and valuation factors environment the principles of uncertainty and instability inform us how to manage risk in various economic environments and reinforce the value of saving growth the principles of human productivity and leadership  governance help us answer the questions of how and where growth will more likely occur valuation the principle of inherent value helps us analyze the price of various asset types to build a more disciplined approach to portfolio allocation principled reasoning creates a more confident decisionmaking environment for investing as we rely on a set of core principles and an unwavering process with a focus on one primary goal helping to increase the probability of achieving your goals read the full whitepaper of principled reasoning here watch our series of videos on the six principles of principled reasoning the most important question we ask you when considering investment management as part of your financial plan is what is the purpose for your wealth and when will you need it we believe appropriate investment allocations are best derived from a clear understanding of when the assets will be needed matching investments to capital needs – how much money is needed and when – is key to achieving your goals for example it is generally not in your best interest to invest in highly volatile assets when you have a shortterm need for funds but it may be appropriate for longer term investing goals depending on the time frame of your cash flow needs we selectively recommend the following building blocks in constructing investment portfolios stocks to provide growth because it is the only asset class proven to outpace inflation over time bonds to preserve assets and protect against volatility hedge assets to provide protection from inflation and currency destabilization we realize your assets will be used in a variety of ways over time so we not only think about how to increase returns but also focus on managing the risks that may hinder you from achieving a minimum acceptable return read our most recent economic review  outlook   ronald blue  co’s investment policy committee ipc chaired by
