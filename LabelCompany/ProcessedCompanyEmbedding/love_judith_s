rating helpfulness see    displaying items  of  page  of   next last debbie from christfocus harrison ar age  gender female  stars out of  nice brickmaking details but the writing had some problems february   debbie from christfocus harrison ar age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  the brickmakers bride is a historical novel set in  the author described many details about how bricks were made and she worked in historical details like how the recent civil war affected the number of skilled laborers that were available for ewan to hire i found the main characters interesting but i felt like the story started in one direction and then headed in another it seemed like a story about ewan not having the highclass social skills need to get contracts for the brickyard and feeling not worthy of the laura meanwhile laura thinks he wont want to marry her if he knew her secret ewans situation didnt really change but the storys focus changed to the troubles that ewan has at the brickyard i was exasperated that ewan was so selfrighteous about his not pursuing laura while someone else was courting her and then hes suddenly kissing her in the open at a work site and then kisses her again before they start courting and again before she agrees to marry him but hes not very understanding toward a relative who is tempted by a handsome man ewan also started out with a strong faith in god yet he ended up more anxious about things than his unbelieving uncle finally i was disappointed that the author often skipped scenes that shed built up to for example ewan is worried how his uncle will take some news and laura promises to support him during the confrontation andwe skip that whole confrontation there was no sex or bad language overall id recommend this book to fans of historical novels was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate wfnren st cloud fl age  gender female  stars out of  another great book by judith january   wfnren st

female  stars out of  god gives us the desires of our heart april   caroljo farmington mo age over  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  the brickmakers bride by judith miller is an

miller doesnt fail to impress me with her masterful way of telling a story and teaching our history at the same time i throughly enjoyed this book and the characters i recommend this to anyone who loves historical fiction was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate nica age  gender female  stars out of  not what i was hoping for march   nica age  gender female i really wanted to like this book but sadly it was not my favorite however the historical content was interesting as was learning about the brickmaking business the main character laura and her mother sell their brickmaking business to ewan and his uncle who have a tenuous relationship they dont agree on how to run the business which creates conflict ewan wants to run the company in the best and wisest way possible so laura agrees to help as she grew up in the business and is very knowledgeable there are other characters in the book but they cause a lot of conflict and drama i found that annoyed me which is one of the reasons i did not like this book i give this book  out of  stars as it was well written but not an enjoyable read as i would have liked i received a free copy of this book from

nice brickmaking details but the writing had some problems february   debbie from christfocus harrison ar age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for the brickmakers bride refined by love series  the brickmakers bride is a historical novel set in  the author described many details about how bricks were made and she worked in historical details like how the recent civil war affected the number of skilled laborers that were available for ewan to hire i found the main characters interesting but i felt like the story started in one direction and then headed in another it seemed like a story about ewan not having the highclass social skills need to get contracts for the brickyard and feeling not worthy of the laura meanwhile laura thinks he wont want to marry her if he knew her secret ewans situation didnt really change but the storys focus changed to the troubles that ewan has at the brickyard i was exasperated that ewan was so selfrighteous about his not pursuing laura while someone else was courting her and then hes suddenly kissing her in the open at a work site and then kisses her again before they start courting and again before she agrees to marry him but hes not very understanding toward a relative who is tempted by a handsome man ewan also started out with a strong faith in god yet he ended up more anxious about things than his unbelieving uncle finally i was disappointed that the author often skipped scenes that shed built up to for example ewan is worried how his uncle will take some news and laura promises to support him during the confrontation andwe skip that whole confrontation there was no sex or bad language overall id recommend this book to fans of historical novels was this review helpful helpful votes yes

female this review was written for the brickmakers bride refined by love series  i really wanted to like this book but sadly it was not my favorite however the historical content was interesting as was learning about the brickmaking business the main character laura and her mother sell their brickmaking business to ewan and his uncle who have a tenuous relationship they dont agree on how to run the business which creates conflict ewan wants to run the company in the best and wisest way possible so laura agrees to help as she grew up in the business and is very knowledgeable there are other characters in the book but they cause a lot of conflict and drama i found that annoyed me which is one of the reasons i did not like this book i give this book  out of  stars as it was well written but not an enjoyable read as i would have liked i received a free copy of this book from bethany house in exchange for an honest review was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as

judith ripka sterling diamonique heart  bracelet is rated  out of  by  rated  out of  by sita from understated elegance this judith ripka bracelet is truly an everyday piece the bracelet feels substantial on your wrist i love that there is a hidden clasp on it its one of the most understated but elegant bracelets i own i too ordered the  bracelet after reading that the bracelet ran small it fits perfectly the hearts are beautiful but they also remind me of paw prints so you can think of it that way as well date published  rated  out of  by sammycat from elegance made just right ive been a collector of judiths jewelry for decades and sometimes im not in the mood for her larger pieces  but i still love her design aesthetic i was attracted to this piece because it contains many of her design trademarks the panther with berge carving her diamoniquekissed hearts and the solid clasp for a smaller more everyday look this bracelet still has a decent amount of heft and subtle sparkle  an elegant look on a more diminutive scale a winner date published  rated  out of  by candyagain from well  i love this bracelet i am very pleased with this bracelet it is more appropriate for every day wear than some of my more ornate jr bracelets it is flat so it doesnt catch on things the clasp is sturdy and i think it has a nice weight to it im very pleased with this item i wear more of a   inch bracelet and find the  and  length better for the workday the dq hearts are a nice touch and the lower setting is again better for practical wearing date published  rated  out of  by carole w from nothing special i love judith ripka and have a ton of her items which i love however i was unimpressed with this bracelet i purchased as a weareverydaywitheverythng bracelet similar to a tennis bracelet but was disappointed that it barely shows up on the wrist it is small and very lightweight and the hearts have no bling and just arent there in fact i could not feel it on my wrist and was so afraid id lose it without knowing i would like this style better without the hearts with the same design links only broader and heavier the fastener was difficult for me as well i ordered the  which fit more like a   which made it difficult to open and close i believe this bracelet is more for someone with a very small wrist though my wrist is average   it is not for me sorry judith i love most of your items this one just isnt for me date published  rated  out of  by llf from worst purchase from jr the host was raving on and on about how this was the best bracelet judith has ever done i am shocked because this was my absolute worst purchase from judith ripkas line the bracelet is so light weight it is unbelievable the links kink and are difficult to straighten it looks like a bracelet that i would purchase for my  year old niece i own a lot of judiths pieces and love her line but lately everything ive received from her is horrible and ive had to pay to return it bring us the

judith ripka verona  heart  key charm bracelet g sterling is rated  out of  by  rated  out of  by mehndi from i keep trying to like judiththis bracelet seemed a lot nicer on line and tvbought at a reduced price and cant imagine it at the regular price not even worth the sale price it looks cheap i bought the colored version and didnt realize its almost striped looking and the heart is thin and key tiny date published  rated  out of  by chrisq from love love love these i love this bracelet so much more than i expected to i thought it would be like the smaller verona bracelet and therefore waaay overpriced instead i found this bracelet has large chunky links with great texture these links have deeper grooves which i love and for me the colors are fantastic i bought the rose the sterling and then the yellow i got them all as is and am thrilled with each one i love the look of the frosty silver color the yellow is a little tight on me because i had to get the   because there was no  in yellow as is the yellow one is particularly gorgeous because of its rich buttery color i think i missed out on the black but hopefully itll show up as is in the  or the   my wrist measures   so i can use either size i prefer the larger size but either will do if you have the same size wrist as me id love to have a necklace in this link but im sure it would cost a fortune thanks for as is qvc no way could i have these without it i really appreciate the low prices and sometimes even ep on as is items date published  rated  out of  by starshine from love my heart bracelet i love my chocolate heart bracelet yes it is difficult to clasp and yes it could use a few more links for a drapier fit but it is gorgeous the diamonique heart and key are so sparkly and sweet i love the chocolate brown color and the shimmer of the links i wear my bracelet often love those judith ripka hearts date published  rated  out of  by vll from beautiful but not long enough loved it but because it is so chunky needs to be longer in length to work for my wrist always a problem with me perhaps judith you could devise a textured link to extend like they do on the watches i tried my trustee magnets but due to the thickness of the links which are beautiful it doesnt work ill keep trying as when it does work its a keeper date published  rated  out of  by fata from beautiful but i love the design of this bracelet the heart and key and the overall design i ordered the sterling silver version and ultimately decided to keep the bracelet but i am taking it to a jeweler to have extra links added i ordered the  inch version and it is extremely difficult to clasp without assistance from another person this is why the low review it is not an inexpensive bracelet so i would think it should actually be longer than  inches so that it would fit like an  inch bracelet date published  rated  out of  by half angel from nice bracelet too hard to put on i have to return this item i ordered the cheapie  jr bracelet and had to return that no clasp end you were just supposed to clasp to a link now this bracelet actually has a clasp end its just too darn small and the bracelet too tight to clasp properly i have a  wrist and this  bracelet just did not have enough chain for me to clasp it unless you want a bracelet that is hard to put on dont bother tired of returning jr items date published  rated  out of  by nanajoyce from beautiful but not well made i was absolutely thrilled to receive the bracelet it was gorgeous and it immediately attracted a number of compliments however after wearing it daily for  week the charms suddenly just disconnected and fell to the ground while i was simply walking in my apartmentdefinitely not up to judith ripkas usual standards so i am returning the bracelet sadly

the following story was inspired by data documented on an animal rescue website they should have called her angel but instead she was given a name more reflective of her masters’ despicable character abusive behaviour and unconscionable betrayal i don’t possess any information about judith’s life before she mistakenly arrived at this house of horrors but i know indisputably that her story holds true for innumerable dogs at this very moment i never met judith but her tragic beginning implores me to give her a voice while her heart wrenching image propels me to continue advocating on behalf of innocent animals awaiting justice   try if you can to imagine where you were ten years ago remember your surroundings daily activities ongoing interactions and aspirations consider how many days and hours you have passed in this decade filled with countless experiences and unforgettable memories now envision yourself restrained by a cold steel chain bound to your neck condemning you to an uninhabitable wooden dog house for ten torturous years this was the life of judith    and for many others like her   i internalize the mixed feelings of anxiety and excitement of a vulnerable animal going to a new home ready to start a lifelong commitment of providing fierce loyalty unconditional love and everlasting companionship to a worthy family without any background knowledge i can presume that these were the emotions experienced by judith as she arrived at her new home maybe this was not the case perhaps she was violently taken and shown cruelty from the moment they set their sinful eyes on her like all dogs her only desire was to feel loved in return for her consistent devotion what she received was the most vicious torment one could ever endure for one hundred twenty months judith suffered in silence her cries were noticed but perpetually ignored instead of preparing for the joy of a new pet her owners contemplated the many ways in which they could inflict punishment   with the name “judas” crudely spraypainted on her makeshift dog house judith began her life of agony all the while she would wonder what she had done to cause such hatred this illfated dog spent ten years waiting for freedom but until that day would arrive the rest of the world existed around her as she politely stared at the same surroundings to the point of madness   the same chains dog house dirt and fear would envelope her unspeakable life to further her sentence judith was never given any toys with which to play and occupy the excruciating monotony of every passing minute while people went about their busy lives judith waited   as the seasons changed from hellish heat to unbearable cold judith suffered the oppressive sun without anyone to care about her intense thirst and exhaustion when the acute deep freeze sustained the long winter months nobody brought her inside or offered her a blanket   overtime her coat became thick and matted her legs deformed and crippled from exposure her health deteriorated from malnutrition and eventually her vibrant brown fur turned a deeper shade of grey but still she waited judith waited for someone to cut her chains which left her sitting in her own bodily waste and that of her masters   in addition to denying judith any proper food water and cleanliness her owners committed a revolting act of indecency in order to strip away any shred of remaining dignity bordered by her excrement and with nowhere to run she awaited further maltreatment judith’s “human” owners never came outside to lovingly feed or play fetch but rather to stand over and defile her neighbours witnessed this atrocity but could do little to help since bylaw enforcers permitted judith’s “family” to disgrace her with indignant acts of violence   how this magnificent beauty managed to stay alive is a testament to her undying spirit through the grace of god the day finally materialized when judith’s wait was over human heroes had come to rescue her she even barked with her innate duty to protect her family from intruders – a family who forced her to sleep on frozen ground covered in snow rescue workers took photographs of her horrid living conditions physical malformations and other devastating effects of neglect judith was given a hair cut to remove the infested matting and received healthy nourishment to fill her empty stomach judith experienced a lifetime of love in the seconds it took rescuers to bond with her after her rehabilitation judith found her way into a home she deserved from the onset this family loved her tremendously and spent their time expressing their fond adoration   with all the questions i would like to pose about the reasons for which judith had to wait ten years to be rescued i can currently answer one with certainty  i truly believe judith was an angel sent to incarnate a visual representation of societal indifference   although she was given a name indicative of brutality she was not the beast through all her unequivocal suffering judith never lost her trusting disposition and ability to adapt to a new environment her previous life makes me wonder how we can refer to ourselves as a society when such ruthlessness inflicted upon animals is permissible by way of apathy when did we become so complacent in our ability to stand up for the rights and freedoms of animals how can individual communities knowingly allow animals to be chained outside for a decade under the worst conceivable conditions without consideration for their welfare   sadly judith’s life in her new home wasn’t eternal after a year of peace the rainbow gate opened its arms to welcome her home after her mission on earth had been completed she had been sent down to show the world that animals are beloved creatures to be respected and admired judith’s life touched so many hearts in a manner that will hopefully lead society to question its own beliefs while encouraging the public to seek legislative change to animal welfare bylaws by ignoring her pleas and those of other animals we become just as guilty as judith’s heinous keepers who demonstrated such disregard for her life   let us use our conscience to form moral decisions in favour of unchaining animals by having the strength in our conviction that as a society we cannot in good faith consent to this form of callousness by cherine
