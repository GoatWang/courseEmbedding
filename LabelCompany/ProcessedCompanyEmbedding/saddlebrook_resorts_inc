experienced it i can officially say how awful you lay back on a massage table and on dry hair your scalp masseuse drips about a bottle worth of aromatherapy all over your head i never noticed how annoying the sound of dry hair being rubbed sounded the scalp masseuse then told me to sit in the steam room for a bit so the oils could titillate my scalp it took three shampoos to get the oil of my hair and the steam room didnt help matters at all normally you come home from the spa looking relaxed and renewed all i can say was that it was pretty embarrassing walking through the resort and

june   via mobile i reviewed saddlebrook resort last summer and was told that the dining experience in particular would be vastly improved after my review in march  i came with my school team for a training trip we arrived at pm ish that evening and were brought to a white tent when we went inside we were told by the bored staff that all the food was gone and there was none left after a long  hour flight we were annoyed to say the least we were forced to wait for  hours at tds to be served and we had to pay extra after this experience they kept us in the tent with food that was subpar compared even to the inside dining which was noted in my review was not very good again the tennis program was amazing but the treatment of junior players must be improved at the resort once again i felt less than the regular guests very disappointed prob will not return stayed march  traveled on business helpful  thank c d report ask c d about saddlebrook resort tampa this review is the
