of support from the product engineers and customer serviceconsthe company still thinks that they are in the s and some reps still think that they are independent agents making it hard for the company to grow there can be several reps in a single geographical area making it a challenge to get new business let alone to compete against other mro suppliers closing down a distribution center minimizing the product lines and the corporate downsizing only says one thing business for salelosing strategic accounts hurts the reps abilities to land the large accounts and the competitive edge to the big

adopted accounting standards update  “compensationstock compensation topic ” “asu ” prior to january   the company recognized excess tax benefits or deficiencies of stockbased compensation expense to the extent that there were sufficient recognized excess tax benefits previously recognized as a component of additional paidin capital asu  requires the company to account for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur the adoption was applied on a modified retrospective basis all deferred tax assets related to stockbased compensation are fully reserved and therefore there is no net effect on the companys balance sheet for the first quarter of  as a result of including the income tax effects from excess tax benefits in income tax expense the effects of the excess tax benefits are no longer included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding resulting in an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding the company adopted this change in the method of calculating diluted shares outstanding on a prospective basis asu  also permits entities to make an accounting policy election related to how forfeitures will impact the recognition of compensation cost for stockbased compensation to either estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered as currently required or to account for forfeitures as they occur upon adoption of asu  the company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur the change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by   as of january   additionally asu  addressed the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows the company is now required to present the cost of shares withheld from the employee to satisfy the employees’ income tax liability as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows rather

insufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income therefore substantially all deferred tax assets are currently subject to a tax valuation allowance however sufficient evidence may become available in future periods regarding the utilization of deferred tax assets that would lead to the

valuation allowance position a tax benefit of  thousand and an expense of  million was recorded for the three months ended march   and  respectively primarily due to reserves for uncertain tax

injections to reduce the degradation time the estimated expenditures over a  year period under the three scenarios ranged from  million to  million  of which up to  million may be capitalized as the company has determined that a loss was probable and no scenario was more likely than the other at that time a liability in the amount of  million was established in  during  after further evidence had been collected and analyzed the company concluded that it was probable that future remediation would be required and accordingly accrued an additional  million for the estimated costs this estimate is based on the information developed to date and as the remediation efforts proceed additional information may impact the final cost as of march    agreement with alabama’s voluntary cleanup program on viable treatment of the property has not yet been reached and the company continues to evaluate potential remediation alternatives that could impact the ultimate cost of remediation as of march

as well as a large number of regional and local distributors the mro business is significantly impacted by the overall strength of the manufacturing sector of the us economy one measure used to evaluate the strength of the industrial products market is the pmi index published by the institute for supply management which is considered by many economists to be a reliable nearterm economic barometer of the manufacturing sector a measure above  generally indicates expansion of the manufacturing sector while a measure below  generally represents contraction the average monthly pmi was  in the first quarter of  and  in the first quarter of   indicating an increase in the growth of the us manufacturing economy our sales are also affected by the number of sales representatives and the

of  over the prior year quarter we have moderated the rate of hiring incremental sales representatives in the first quarter and we anticipate that the pace of rep growth growth will be slower in the

representatives and related expenses to support our sales efforts selling expenses increased to  million in the first quarter of  from  million in the prior year quarter and as a percent of sales

the past year and higher health insurance expenses general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to operate our distribution network and overhead expenses to manage the business general and administrative expenses increased to  million in the first quarter of  from  million in the prior year quarter due primarily to a lower benefit from stockbased
