sustainable investing investing strategies climate change impact investing by cary krosinsky updated august   founded in  and now headquartered in bethesda md calvert investments had more than  billion in assets under management as of july   making it one of the largest sustainable and responsible sri fund managers in the us today calvert serves individual investors financial advisors and their clients retirement plans and insurance carriers as well as institutional investors through a variety of equity bond and assetallocation strategies using environmental social and governance esg research and corporate engagement strategies are available via mutual funds subadvisory services and separate account managementcalvert is one of the longest standing players in sri since its inception more than  years agoshortly after the launch of its first mutual fund calvert investments made headlines for being the first mutual fund advisor to take a stand against apartheid four years later calvert investments became the first mutual fund advisor to file a shareholder resolution tied to a social issue on labormanagement relations  they have been involved in many such resolutions since as can be seen at their website herelegacy of firstscalvert has long maintained a strong conviction that evaluating the environmental social and governance esg profiles of companies – in addition to traditional financial metrics – gives calvert broader and deeper insight helping the company best generate attractive returns and avoid risks in the s calvert investments won a landmark victory for the sri community calvert asked the department of labor dol for an advisory opinion on the suitability of socially screened funds as investment options for defined contribution plans such as ks until then managers of such plans had been concerned that including sri funds in their offerings would violate their legal obligation to maximize returns based on a mistaken belief that sri funds yielded inferior returns the dol advised that an sri fund in fact can be used as an investment option in k plans provided its expected return is equal to other investments with similar risk this expanded access to sri funds for individual investorsin  calvert launched the first global code of corporate conduct – the calvert women’s principles® – to focus exclusively on empowering advancing and investing in women worldwide the un subsequently adopted these principles in  calvert marks the tenth anniversary of the principles and celebrates the fact that more than  global companies have signed on from pioneer to established institutioncalvert has been on the frontlines of taking the sri movement from being something of a radical idea to what is now more of an established force now calvert is in transition seeking to redefine itself as a recognized leading competitor in a somewhat developed sri marketcalvert embraces the fact that sustainable investing is a big tent it is no longer a onesizefitsall strategy nor has it been for some time which is why calvert offers multiple approaches across  equity and fixedincome the company distinguishes itself from much of its competition by meeting a wide range of investor needs and continues to expand its offerings calvert is actively building its retirement specialist team and is enhancing its offerings for institutional investors by recruiting more specialists and broadening its product base across asset classesunder the bigtent calvert’s investment strategies both equity and fixed income can be categorized by one of the following three sustainable investment approachesapplying sustainable and responsible criteria to help clients invest in ways consistent with their values creating portfolios that focus on  investment themes with positive impactor by using the integration of environmental social and governance data in the security analysis process to drive better investment outcomesin all cases calvert excludes companies from its portfolios that are involved in certain particularly harmful activities such as tobacco and weapons production thereafter calvert actively seeks out companies that effectively manage their impactshuman rights protection in the supply chain reporting on environmental practices transparency and accountability at the board level – these are the hallmarks of the best run companies when properly analyzed according to this model calvert believes that these considerations can contribute to better outcomes for investorscalvert’s approach to sustainable investing is evident in some of its developments in recent yearsat a time when water issues are among the top global environmental risks the firm serves as investment advisor to the calvert global water fund which invests in companies whose main business is in the water sector or that are significantly involved in waterrelated services or technologies calvert is also pioneering in the fixedincome space where it recently developed a “green” fixed income strategy and now manages the calvert green bond fund the fund is one of the first products to use an approach that looks for corporate leaders in addition to investing in “green” project bonds the firm also recently launched a resource efficiency strategy focused on seeking out the companies in each sector that are making the most efficient use of resources in their areas of business such as water energy and waste the strategy which is the result of calvert’s alliance with osmosis investment management emerged in response to the recent trend of global capital allocation to new products processes technologies and services designed to confront global economic challenges such as overpopulation and natural resource depletion it is currently available through merrill lynchmaking an impact on corporate behaviorcalvert also has stood out in its use of strategic engagement and shareholder advocacy to encourage positive change in
