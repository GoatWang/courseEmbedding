special discount getting proper nutrition including all of your daily recommended fruits and vegetables and vitamins can take a lot of work this is especially important as we get older… the problem is – lets face it unless you keep your house stocked with organic vegetables it can be tricky getting all your daily recommended servings and all those vitamins and antioxidants everybody keeps talking about all the time the solution visit the official website to claim your special lowest price discount on patriot power greens now a texan doctor named dr lane sebring md and patriot health alliance have teamed up to make a new greensuperfood drink called “patriot power greens” that offers an easy way to get a ton of nutritional value in one small serving of juice the product is unique in that it contains only organic nongmo ingredients and because it has been formulated by a doctor who is highly regarded as a leading antiaging expert what exactly is this “patriot power greens” drink all about patriot power greens creator dr lane sebring patriot power greens is an all natural blend of  organic fruits and vegetables  probiotic strains and  digestive enzymes that comes as a greendrink powder that you mix with water juice or even into a smoothie… dr sebring who formulated the juice is a medical doctor antiaging specialist and board examiner for the american academy of antiaging medicine he created the drink to help neutralize the excess acid and inflammation that he asserts can trigger an assortment of common age related maladies what are the ingredients in patriot power greens patriot power greens contains organic apple organic kale organic broccoli organic spinach organic carrot organic parsley organic beet organic green cabbage organic blueberry organic raspberry organic strawberry organic tomato organic spirulina organic blue agave inulin beet juice powder acai goji amia fruit extract spirulina kombu seaweed nori seaweed wakame seaweed the  probiotic strains the  digestive enzymes and more see image at right patriot power greens benefits  – health benefits galore – numerous studies indicate that the ingredients in patriot power greens can have numerous highly positive effects on the human body  – superior taste one thing those who have tried power greens seem to agree on is that the taste is superior to other green health drinks which commonly have strong grassy earthy tones i’m drinking a glass right now as i write this to make sure that i describe it accurately basically it is just very light lightly sweet with a mild berry flavor and just the slightest hint of greensyness overall i find the immediate experience of drinking it refreshing  – organic nongmo no soy etc… one of the best things about this product is what it doesn’t have in it no pesticides no heavy metals none of that scary stuff it’s even suitable for vegetarians here’s a list of some of the icky things that patriot power greens makes sure to keep out of it’s product – no gluten – no wheat – no dairy – no eggs – no soy – no shellfish – no egg – no fish – no tree nuts – no peanuts – no artificial sweeteners – no caffeine – no gmo ingredients  – drinking patriot power greens floods your body with powerful nutrients micronutrients phytochemicals probiotics and digestive enzymes patriot power greens compared when compared to the other leading greendrinks on the market patriot power greens differnetiates itself in a number of ways one key difference is that many greens powders use cheaper and less nutritious ingredients like wheatgrass barley and soy to bulk up even though these ingredients can according to dr sebring actuallycause the same kind of inflammation we are looling to avoid patriot power greens on the other hand has a far greater nutritional density which means a more powerful dose of nutrients phytochemicals and probiotics product safety the patriot health alliance guarantees all of their ingredients are processed in an fda registered facility certified in good manufacturing practices gmp and that they go through  levels of inspection before being shipped out you may likely be reassured to know that such care is put into ensuring the purity of patriot greens especially when many supplement companies are known to take “shortcuts” in this area indeed while patriot health sources their ingredients from established and tightly monitored organic farms many other companies get their ingredients from polluted foreign regions where they are available at rock bottom prices i for one think it makes a lot more sense to go with the higher quality ingredients even if it ends up costing a few more pennies per serving after all the whole point of a drink like power greens is to give your body what it wants and needs for optimal function take a gander at how the patriot health greens compare with other greens powders on the market… is there a “satisfaction guarantee” for patriot power greens patriot health alliance guarantees

probiotics and digestive enzymes patriot power greens compared when compared to the other leading greendrinks on the market patriot power greens differnetiates itself in a number of ways one key difference is that many greens powders use cheaper and less nutritious ingredients like wheatgrass barley and soy to bulk up even though these ingredients can according to dr sebring actuallycause the same kind of inflammation we are looling to avoid patriot power greens on the other hand has a far greater nutritional density which means a more powerful dose of nutrients phytochemicals and probiotics product safety the patriot health alliance guarantees all of their ingredients are processed in an fda registered facility certified in good manufacturing practices gmp and that they go through  levels of inspection before being shipped out you may likely be reassured to know that such care is put into ensuring the purity of patriot greens especially when many supplement companies are known to take “shortcuts” in this area indeed while patriot health sources their ingredients from established and tightly monitored organic farms many other companies get their ingredients from polluted foreign regions where they are available at rock bottom prices i for one think it makes a lot more sense to go with the higher quality ingredients even if it ends up costing a few more pennies per serving after all the whole point of a drink like power greens is to give your body what it wants and needs for optimal function take a gander at how the patriot health greens compare with
