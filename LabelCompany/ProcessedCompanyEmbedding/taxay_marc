patent battle cisco says arista’s redesign moves not good enough cisco calls on arista to stop selling products in us after agency reverses video what is softwaredefined networking sdn the legal pingpong battle between cisco and arista thursday found cisco on the winning side as in the international trade commission ruled that arista switches infringe on two core cisco patents that the company says are key technologies in its network switching pantheonmore on network world arista gets important win over cisco in patent battlemark chandler senior vice president general counsel and secretary of cisco wrote in a blog post of the commission’s specific ruling that arista was in violation of us patent  “access control list processing in hardware” in violation of us patent  “control plane security and traffic flow management” “both of these patents cover core cisco networking technology the ‘ patent a named inventor of which is arista chairman and founder andy bechtolsheim who presumably was aware of his own invention when designing arista products is a fundamental cisco invention that improves processing in network devices” chandler said “the ‘ patent covers a core cisco invention for improving network device security and helps among other things prevent denial of service attacks like our other patents that arista was found to infringe these inventions were developed by cisco employees and remain critical to the cuttingedge products that we sell” chandler wrote that “by confirming administrative law judge mcnamara’s initial determination the commission brings the total confirmed arista patent violations to five today’s ruling in the “ investigation” concludes commission review of the two cases brought by cisco in december ” chandler stated “the commission’s decision is the latest of several findings that arista has intentionally and unlawfully copied cisco’s proprietary technology  as the commission put it in its lessredacted version of the‘ ruling which was made public only two weeks ago “arista’s behavior evinces a corporate culture of copying” and finding that at best arista was “willfully blind” to cisco’s intellectual property it is this culture of copying that cisco has aimed at in its legal action”more on network world extreme offers glimpse of integrated avaya brocade technology futuretoday’s itc ruling also included a recommended remedy which consists of an import ban and a cease and desist order and that arista pay a  bond on covered products sold or imported during a prescribed presidential review period these affect all arista switches the burden is on arista to demonstrate that any changes it makes to its products will be sufficient to avoid further infringement chandler stated   “now begins the day presidential review period for this case which expires on july   at that time barring a very unlikely intervention from the us trade representative on behalf of the president the new itc orders will go into effect – banning the import sale and distribution of arista products in the us”firing back marc taxay arista vice president and general counsel said in a statement to network worldwe believe that ciscos litigation is part of a broader effort to preserve its market position at the expense of competition and innovation ciscos motives are revealed through its assertion of the  patent against a year old technology that is embedded in standard chips we buy off the shelf from vendors like many others in our industry including cisco cisco has never asserted these patents against any other network switch vendor or third party chip supplier and given that it filed its patent application for this technology in  and the patent expires in june  cisco has had ample years to do so” the ruling was referred to during arista’s q  earnings announcementin response to an analyst’s question about the findings taxay stated “there are two iprs inter partes review  a procedure for challenging the validity of a united states patent before the united states patent and trademark office  that have been instituted on the  and the  patents which were the patents that were found to have been infringed in the  there were hearings that were held at the ptab patent trial and appeal board in march and the final decisions by the ptab will be issued by june  so from a timing standpoint as you probably know theres a day review period – presidential review period following the issuance of the final determination of the itc so that should come out to july  so the ptab decisions will come out several weeks before that” taxay stated a full transcript of the arista call is available on the seeking alpha site here“at this stage obviously weve been evaluating our designaround strategy we are obviously preparing that strategy in the event that we were to lose the iprs and as i said we just received the final determination so we have to go through the actual written opinion to see how that flows through but certainly our plan would be based upon our review of that we have several different options that were evaluating and well have something together before the end of presidential review period” taxay statedthe current ruling adds yet another twist to the ongoing patent and copyright infringement case between cisco and arista in april arista landed a significant win that let it once again import redesigned products to the us that have been under import embargo since january the socalled ‘ casespecifically according to a post on arista’s site on “april   us customs and border protection “cbp” completed its review and once again ruled that arista’s redesigned products do not infringe the ’ ’ or ’ patents that were the subject of a limited exclusion order and cease and desist order issued by the united states international trade commission itc in investigation no ta and that arista may resume importing its redesigned products into the united states”the action surrounds a claim that arista made that the software that runs its switching products extensible operating system  and later had been sufficiently redesigned to work around cisco’s infringement claimsthe april  ruling follows the january   decision by cbp to revoke its november   ruling that our redesigned products do not infringe the ’ ’ and’ patents that revocation lead to those products being held back from import into the us that ruling said current products which contain its redesigned eos are not within the scope of the limited exclusion order and it could begin selling its product in the us again join the network world communities on facebook and linkedin to comment on topics that are top of mind related cisco networking data center cisco cooney is an online news editor
