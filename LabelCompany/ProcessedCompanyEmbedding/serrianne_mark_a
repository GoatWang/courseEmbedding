sells cincinnati shop to coo selker by jack neff published on january   batavia ohio adagecom  mark serrianne owner and ceo for the past decade of cincinnatis northlich is stepping down and selling

an integrated shop whose services include traditional agency media digital public relations and brand and newproduct consulting terms of the transaction werent disclosed northlich handles accounts for national players such as procter  gamble co including its professional products business trade advertising newproduct consulting and corporate communications yum brands including the long john silvers advertising account won earlier this year and pr assignments for other brands birds eye foods and brownforman including finlandia vodka for which northlich led a brand restaging in  the agency also won renewal late last year of its longrunning ohio tobacco prevention foundation account following a review and it handles advertising for the kentucky lottery kathy selker ms selker in an interview with adagecom said she sees potential for northlich to continue to grow through acquisitions such as the purchase last year of interactive ink a columbus ohio digital shop and through continuing to advance the fivepart integratedmarketing communications model advanced by mr serrianne the ownership change is the fourth in northlichs history with a senior agency executive taking control each time diehard integrationists mr serrianne said he wanted to keep northlich as one of the midwests larger independent agencies  and one of the diehard practitioners of integrated marketing communications which the shop embraced when it was first popular in the early s and stuck with as the concepts popularity waned and then more recently waxed once more northlich runs all five of its disciplines off a single profitandloss statement an approach recently adopted by publicis groupes leo burnett co in configuring its insight group unit ironically leo burnett under prior bcom ownership tried to buy northlich several years ago according to people familiar with the matter enticed largely by northlichs brandstorm consulting unit the consulting unit has been an entry point for several national accounts northlich won for general advertising or pr duties over the years ms selker said including long john silvers and finlandia mr serrianne declined to comment on any specific offers from global holding companies but said that weve always had overtures northlich at one point in  announced but later backed off a deal to merge with digital and relationshipmarketing shop bridge worldwide before the latter was acquired by wpp group in  always been independent weve always been independent and my desire was to continue in that strategy mr serrianne said this is the perfect time weve got the right leadership in place the right kind of momentum going so why not do it northlich long has been cincinnatis largest advertising agency though it may have been surpassed last year by bridge which
