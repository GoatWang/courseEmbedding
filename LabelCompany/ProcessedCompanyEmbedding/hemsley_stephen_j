thank you for joining us today as we reach the halfway point of  unitedhealth group optum and unitedhealthcare continued to grow and perform strongly and we expect our performance momentum to carry forward through the balance of this year into  and beyond unitedhealthcare has been a distinctive organic growth leader over the last seven years during that same time optum has emerged as the leading force for broadly enabling the healthcare industry with market leading data analytics and practical and innovative approaches to longstanding market challenges these businesses are strong stable and exceptionally complementary to each other growing and operating effectively while continuing to diversify naturally into adjacent healthcare markets with a socially sensitive global healthcare market constantly challenged and changing we see unitedhealth group optum and unitedhealthcare built for that environment adaptable and creative focused on the people and customers we serve working with others and playing our role in leading and supporting progressive change across health systems one important constant is our commitment to mission and the quality of our work the positive experience and value we drive on behalf of consumers and customers and their cultural bonds of integrity compassion relationships innovation and accountable performance we seek to bring to everything we do we

knowing the next  years hold more opportunity than the last  those who are committed to keep evolving perform consistently and deliver value to guide our progress we have a strong deep and restless leadership team in place which will continue to positively evolve and change as well ill turn to three of those leaders dave wichmann larry renfro and john rex to take us through our second quarter earnings report dave david s wichmann thank you steve we enter the second half of  in a strong position unitedhealth group is serving more people more consistently with greater levels of measurable satisfaction than ever we are reaching helping and staying connected to the people we are privileged to serve in more ways and through more channels both digitally and physically in the communities where we work we are caring for more people closing more gaps in care and producing more savings and value for consumers and sponsors we are partnering more deeply and impactfully with care providers in part because our nearly  optumcare doctors are dedicated to serving patients affiliated with more than  payers across the nation including unitedhealthcare that experience helps us to think more broadly than most about topics like the application of technology to enhance the consumer experience the use of data analytics and data exchange effective management of healthcare resources and evidence based protocols and healthcare quality consistency and payment models that better serve people and plan sponsors today we serve  million people globally including  million people in the united states and we see unitedhealth groups us and global market potential as with all practical limit at this early stage in the evolution of our company second quarter results followed things from our first quarter performance in the second quarter the company produced strong and balanced revenue growth pacing to exceed the  billion mark this year medical costs were in line with expectations operating costs continued to be well contained the company generated strong cash flows up  yearoveryear as adjusted net earnings grew  over last years second quarter to  per share for the first half of  adjusted net earnings grew  yearoveryear to  per share unitedhealthcare continued to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter excluding the individual market unitedhealthcare grew to serve  million more people yearoveryear including  million more in the first half of  this continues our consistent multiyear organic growth performance across all three major businesses this growth has been fueled by a long history of restless products and service innovation responding to and even sometimes driving market evolution this focus towards innovation has advanced the data information and tools to support both individual efforts to achieve better health and system wide efforts to deliver better healthcare a business model increasingly centered on serving the unique healthcare needs of consumers we are performing in serving new populations such as group medicare advantage people with complex conditions served by medicaid programs in emerging markets like brazil as well as in longstanding well established markets healthcare is essential to everyone individually and to the quality and productivity of societies and we aim to serve it all in one way or another one person at a time to the best of our abilities a dedicated compassionate workforce of  people serving in local communities built on unitedhealth group values and singularly aimed at helping people live healthier lives and helping make our health system work better for everyone they are led by a deep and stable unitedhealthcare leadership team that has worked together for more than a decade and finally our commitment to quality in everything we do in advancing net promoter scores both strengthening customer and consumer retention and care provider relationships across all of our businesses in many ways we are still just getting started but you can see the momentum in our results in the employer market our local group commercial business continues to grow organically month in and month out virtually every month for almost three years in the past  months we have grown to serve nearly  more people through full risk products in the employer group market we are growing by consistently serving the health needs of this population at more affordable levels and with greater consistency in the quality of their experiences and the cost of their coverages across medicare advantage and supplement unitedhealthcare has grown to serve  more people in the past year with balanced growth in the individual senior market and the corporate retiree market our medicare advantage business continues to benefit from strong consumer retention reflecting seniors positive experience and the clear economic value of our offerings in  our distinctive product value and consumer experience should allow us to continue to grow as we expect to increase our overall medicare advantage market share in a growing medicare advantage market again next year states continued to turn to the private sector to strengthen and modernize their medicaid programs we are implementing four new state awards this year in california missouri nebraska and virginia we discussed dual special needs plans with you in our first quarter call and our revenues serving people through these plans grew  yearoveryear in the second quarter in total our community and state business served over  more people at june  taken as a whole the unitedhealthcare businesses grew revenues this quarter by  billion or nearly  to  billion despite forgoing over  billion in revenues from the aca individual insurance market withdrawals and the health insurance tax moratorium earnings from operations exceeded  billion in the quarter growing  consistent with our top line growth rate in the quarter after considering the aca items let me now turn it to larry for his perspective on unitedhealth groups enterprise growth and an update on optum larry larry c renfro thank you dave yesterday evening unitedhealth group was honored to announce the early renewal and extension of our distinctive and longstanding relationship serving seniors together with aarp our two organizations have a  year history of working together to serve seniors greatest needs and to advance health and healthcare in practical ways each of us believes there is no better collaborator for the work we do on behalf of those we serve we expect the value of this relationship to grow further in the years ahead as we continue to implement shared ideas and innovations to better serve americans over age  as the growth of that population accelerates meaningfully the aarp relationship is a good example of our leaders working at the enterprise level to develop broader deeper relationships strengthen customer experience through nps disciplines and drive strong sustained multiyear growth other examples abound receiving new awards as well as contract renewals and expansions serving state medicaid programs corporate medicare advantage awards new and renewing pharmacy care services awards and the department of defense engaging us to provide nurseline and digital clinical support services to military health system beneficiaries or the work we are now doing for merck and others in the life sciences domain to help understand the impact of their medicines in a value based contracting world the breadth of that list should give you a sense of why this team shows a high level of optimism as we look ahead to the next decade we serve deep end markets with significant unmet needs and we are working to better serve these customers by improving the economic value of our services consistently raising quality and innovating in ways that solve problems these efforts are steadily driving net promoter scores higher turning specifically to optum second quarter revenues increased by  billion or  to  billion driven by strong organic growth even as optumrx revenue growth rate was affected by its delivery of significant channel savings to customers and consumers optum’s earnings from operations grew  to  billion as operating margins expanded  basis points over last year to  all segments grew earnings by doubledigit percentage rates in the second quarter at optumhealth we grew to serve  million more people in the past  months with per capita revenues growing about  this is an important metric as we look towards future deepening our relationships with the consumer growth continues to be led by optumcare business which grew revenues by more than  through the combination of strong organic growth and strategic business expansion at optumcare our goal is to create and operate the leading high value ambulatory care delivery system in the nation offering high quality cost effective care to a full spectrum of payers and patients we do this by empowering clinicians with data insight and workflow protocols that bring the best of optum analytics to bare in settings where strong analytics directly impact peoples lives for the better by improving patient value and satisfaction at the best sites of service for care delivery helping people access care that is convenient high quality and affordable and by serving physician employees and partners giving them the tools and support they need to be great medical practitioners focused on the clinical needs of their patients and on growing their practices to serve more health plans and people the second quarter was our first full quarter with surgical care affiliates included in optumcares results scas performance is slightly ahead of our expectations at this point the sca team continues to expand their business establishing six surgical outpatient facilities so far this year we are working and accelerating pipeline of opportunities on aligning future development priorities with our overall optumcare geographic market strategy and the needs of consumers in our health plan customers like sca the medexpress portion of optumcare continues to grow steadily medexpress opened  new neighborhood care centers in the first half of  and is on pace to produce record growth while experimenting with alternative formats and approaches that could deliver even greater convenience and value to consumers in the local market primary care business we were privileged this past quarter to expand with two exceptional market leading group practices in indianapolis and denver we continue to align with the leading local medical groups who are committed to the idea that patients benefit significantly from deeper investment in proactive primary care services our doctors help patients achieve a healthier state and to do so with a favorable cost profile we are more than five years into the optumcare build out but we are still in the early stages we remain focused on its steady development and see this business as a significant source of growth for the next  years and more at optumrx the revenue growth rate of  was well in line with expectations for  revenue yield per script was flat as we effectively passed supply chain improvements on to our customers we continued to experience strong customer retention as large sophisticated buyers who value transparency are attracted to our data driven clinically integrated approach these organizations are represented in a strong pipeline stemming from our healthcare transformation alliance relationship discussed in our last earnings call and our recent award to provide pharmacy care services to the state of new jersey beginning next year optumrx fulfilled  million adjusted scripts in the second quarter an increase of  over the last year in  we again expect to grow our adjusted script volume above the industry growth rate optuminsight continues its strong growth pace particularly in the payer and care provider markets with recent awards or late stage rfps in the areas of data analytics payment integrity business services revenue management and clinical best practices optuminsights revenue backlog grew  or  billion in the past  months with  million added in the first half of  included  million in the second quarter stepping back optum is positioned on the front edge of the major growth trends in the market helping the health system perform better for everyone we use advanced technology market leading health analytics modern care delivery data driven population health approaches and distinctive pharmacy care services as a portfolio of capabilities that help our clients reduce cost and solve complex operational challenges on behalf of the people they serve this unique position gives optum a long runway for continued growth and we are further focusing our growth efforts to take advantage of the opportunities now let me turn it over to john rex john rex thank you larry the strength of our two business platforms drove strong consistent well balanced results in the quarter five of the seven reporting businesses had revenue growth rates above  as consolidated revenues grew  surpassing  billion in a single quarter for the first time our consolidated earnings from operations exceeded  billion and our net earnings to shareholders grew  yearoveryear to  billion in the quarter second quarter adjusted eps rose  to  per share the second quarter medical care ratio of  brought our yeartodate care ratios to  putting us on track to be at or below the midpoint of our full year  outlook of  plus or minus  basis points medical costs have been well managed and continue within our established outlook and market pricing across segments and products remains disciplined and rational the operating cost ratio was  in the second quarter and  through the first six months for the full year we expect to be at or slightly above the midpoint of our  full year outlook of  plus or minus  basis points due to the mixed impact of care provider expansions which carry disproportionately higher operating costs and which added about  basis points yearoveryear to our consolidated operating cost ratio in the quarter these mix changes signaled the continuing diversification of our revenues touching on capital for a moment our board increased our dividend payment rate by  to  per share annually at our june board meet and we expect to achieve a debt to total capital ratio of approximately  by the end of this current quarter three months sooner than our previous outlook cash flows from operations through the first half of  are solidly in line with our outlook and we continue to expect approximately  billion for the full year an increase of  over last year this morning weve increased our outlook for  adjusted net earnings to a more narrow and higher range of  to  per share prudently recognizing the strength in this quarter we remain comfortable with the existing street consensus view of third quarter adjusted net earnings per share with full year  adjusted eps now expected to grow in the area of  of the midpoint we feel this is an appropriate stance at this point of the year steve stephen j hemsley thank you john we recognize at this point in the year thoughts begin to shift to the year ahead consistent with our past practices we are not going to discuss  in any depth this morning its simply too soon and there is too much unknown at this point but we can offer directionally suggests the fundamentals of our businesses remain strong and we feel positively about our ability to perform and grow in  like any year  will have its share of headwinds and tailwinds the tailwinds are largely organic and company specific among them we would include continuing growth momentum and performance particularly with customer retention as our focus on nps improves increasingly effective capabilities to manage and contain medical costs the improving leverage of our operating infrastructure and our continuing efforts to optimizing capital management investment income tax cost and other areas the headwinds are largely around externalities national and state healthcare policies funding trends and taxes which we and you are all following closely we respect the complexity of the social economic and political matters that are intertwined here and certainly at this stage in the national conversation speculation about any outcome here would just be that so we approach each year determined to overcome headwinds and grow to our best potential given the diverse and complementary portfolio of businesses and capabilities we can deploy for  and beyond themes for us will center around continued broad based and diverse organic growth across our portfolio steady substantive advances in quality and nps that will gain further momentum in  and position us well for the future but first focus on costs to drive better product price points continued evolution of our products and services toward more consumer centric and market response of designs particularly in healthcare delivery and pharmacy care services deeper larger relationships market alliances and other channel partnerships advancements in the application of next generation technologies to drive better health outcomes value and consumer experience at lower cost and with capital capacities at full strength continued focus on thoughtful deployment of capital including expansion and diversification both domestically and globally and return of capital to shareholders through market rate dividends and measured levels of share repurchase we will give you some initial direction on  in our third quarter earnings call and the full review at our november th investor conference we remain positive and constructive with respect to our organizations potential to better serve the health and well being of individuals and improve the health system overall as we respond to these needs we will realize the remarkable growth potential of this enterprise and we thank you today for your interest our executive team is here in the room with us to answer your questions and please only one question per person thank you questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well take our first question from justin lake with wolfe research please go ahead justin lake thanks good morning i wanted to ask about the optumcare business but first let me congratulate andrew on the new role and then given the optimism on future growth here that was discussed hoping you could put some numbers around the opportunity maybe share with us the current revenue profile for  that’s expected here and then where do you see the ultimate business opportunity in terms of the tam as you continue to roll out your  target msas and then maybe share where you think is the sustainable growth rate for this segment of the business going forward thanks stephen j hemsley justin you seem to have captured all the appropriate themes maybe well have larry start and then andrew pick that up larry c renfro sure justin thats a good question and it’s an appropriate question but i thought i might since were going to talk about growth and maybe give you kind of a general view of growth across optum for a second and then we’ll get to andrew but im going to ask some other people to talk about growth as well im probably going to bring in tim wicks from a financial standpoint and john prince from a pbm standpoint and eric from optum but we’ll lead off with andrew in a second theres really just some three areas of what id call metrics that we pay attention to when we are looking at our growth across optum number one is are our sales pipeline and i think you hit that and again im talking about optum in general and our pipeline today is greater than  billion and its a strong strong pipeline and thats not including what i would call mega deals this is excluding them but we have a very robust pipeline of about  billion our sales yeartodate is around  billion and that  billion would compare to last years sales in  in total of about  billion the year before at about  billion so you can see the growth thats taken place from an overall sales perspective the third area on the metrics would be how we look at our backlog and eric murphy will talk about that in a second but its up and i think i mentioned it in the script  and yearoveryear about  billion so as we have really kicked this year off and what weve done through the first six months has been very robust in all three of those areas so let me switch over to andrew and let andrew talk specifically about what the question that you asked and then were going to walk through some of the other growth areas as well andrew andrew hayek thanks larry good morning justin so as you know we have a belief that theres a significant opportunity to improve the quality the experience and the cost of healthcare on a national basis creating value for patients and the marketplace and the experience over the past several years has been that physicians can achieve outstanding results when empowered with the right analytics tools and support and the market is asking for these kinds of models to improve the cost quality of care so our approach is to tailor our market presence based on the local factors in each market that we serve leveraging primary care urgent care surgery centers and house calls leveraging technology and tools from across optum to create value for our patients and for our care providers we are building this in a multi payer manner serving all payers in the markets that we serve and we believe your question that the market potential is very significant the depth of the issues resolving the value we can create for patients into the marketplace is very significant and we look forward to creating a business multiples of our current size tim wicks justin it is tim wicks let me jump in as well and talk about overall optum revenues so overall total revenue and unaffiliated revenue growth were both in line with our expectations on the quarter optumhealth and optuminsight together had doubledigit unaffiliated revenue growth for the quarter as well i would point also then to optumrx and just want to clarify this work in the supply chain that weve been doing is translating into lower drug costs for consumers and customers and that really would translate then into lower external revenue for this quarter even though external scripts were up yearoveryear as you know we never apologized uhcs growth and uhc grew faster in the quarter which is obviously a positive impact to our revenue as well so as we look at the quarter our revenue and product mix are on plan for yield total revenue and external revenue both in line with our expectations john prince justin this is john prince ceo of optumrx i just wanted to talk a little about optumrx and how we are doing were halfway through the year we are hitting our new business targets and we remain very confident about hitting our full year target our retention is very strong we have renewal rates in the high s as larry mentioned in the script were very honored about the award from the state of new jersey that deal actually brings us more than  new members we see a broad trend that large sophisticated buyers are very attracted to our pharmacy care services model it is very differentiated in the market weve had some other normal wins and we have a health plan wins and also we have renewed our health plan clients who are out too this year we have several new wins through the healthcare transformation alliance which we announced last quarter i would say overall we are very optimistic about optumrxs compelling buyer proposition in the market it is resonating well and we are seeing very good results eric murphy thanks john justin eric murphy with optuminsight to larrys point around regarding optum as well as our backlog regarding optum we are in late stage assessments with four major delivery systems our qualified pipeline for optum is up  yearoveryear the sales cycles in this side of the market as weve shared in the past are elongated and were working diligently right now to improve the assessments that we do with our clients and prospects in this area to be able to get to value proposition discovery in the shorter period of time to generate results for these delivery systems and then finally i would share we’re bullish on where we land for the year regarding backlog of between  billion and  billion for  stephen j hemsley so that was more than you asked for justin but a very fulsome answer so the next question please operator well go next to david windley with jefferies please go ahead david windley hi thanks for taking my question i will switch over to optumrx some recent comments that you made quantified the channel savings that youre making reference to this morning at savings i think on a pmp wide basis of about  i also quantified  of medical what i might call mock on savings or what i believe to be your evidence of the value of synchronization and i wondered if you could maybe elaborate on that and talk about where you think that  can go stephen j hemsley sure john do you want to respond to that john prince sure david this is john prince i am not sure i followed all the math that youre doing but let me take it at a high level i think you know i see at the high level happening and if you just look at our external client market is that our number of clients we serve is up our number of scripts is up but actually the revenue is sort of flat on a per script basis and i think that is really what you see is that the value that were doing really looking at net best cost for clients as we are delivering that and i think that is also why our story is resonating in the market in terms of the value that we bring to our clients what were also seeing is that even though were delivering that value our external product gross margin actually is up yearoveryear so actually were getting the margin online business was driven by that more volume so were actually getting greater margin on it but were actually delivering that value back to the client when were going out into the market were actually talking about not just the pharmacy cost but were talking about total cost of care so what you are seeing in the revenue here that’s our story of the market around pharmacy cost but our real value story as you go to market is people looking at total cost of care and so we actually have a story in the market which were talking to that actually talks about how we save a client  to  per month as they talk about our full synchronized solution and that is what our clients are receiving in our uhc book about  of the clients have that synchronized value we also do that on a direct basis and also with other partners in terms of other health plans that we served in the market so clearly we are seeing a very differentiated value that our clients are seeing in their trend david windley so if i could just clarify so the point to the question was where can the  to  per member per month go john prince well the  to  goes back in terms of their total cost of healthcare so it actually went forward to our number actually the client would see that and the return it would give to them stephen j hemsley it was to the benefit of the client our benefit is the retention of customers and the growth that we get david windley thank you stephen j hemsley next question please operator we’ll go next to kevin fischbeck with bank of america merrill lynch kevin fischbeck hey great thanks i wanted to ask a question on ma actually maybe a two part question first given all the growth that you have there just want to make sure that the performance from margin across expectation is coming in line with how you had expected it this year and i guess secondly you mentioned that you expect to gain share again next year wanted to get a little more color on the purpose behind that because group ma went so far is there anything you dont have that your competitors bids up for next year so i just want to know what gave you confidence in saying that you are going to gain share this early in the process stephen j hemsley why don’t we ask steve nelson kind of give you the broader themes and then brian thompson will fill in the rest steve nelson thanks steve hey kevin this is steve nelson let me just talk a little bit about how were thinking about growth and the positioning of unitedhealthcare overall and because i think the themes are pretty consistent as we move to a specific medicare advantage conversation but weve been very focused on a specific agenda trying to drive value improve our quality very focused on costs both medical and administrative that are really driving an agenda of what we call distinction trying to innovate around our both our clinical experience and our service experience driving improved nps we see that actually across our businesses but particularly in our mapd business as well driving more attention which i think is significantly contributing to the growth and also the inline performance weve seen this year on that growth but also you just heard the optum team talk about their robust capabilities as we bring those things into unitedhealthcare we continue to see that really resonating in the market across all of our businesses and so were really bringing this agenda of distinction to new populations whether we are talking about bringing populations into more populations with complex care complex conditions into managed medicaid or some of the emerging populations that we continue to see grow whether its a dsnp or group medicare advantages as you referenced so really well positioned across all of these businesses but ma is a tremendous story so with that maybe just have brian give some color about what we are seeing there early in this year brian thompson steve thank you kevin good morning this is brian thompson for  we are off to a very strong first half of the year on both service and support as well as our engagement with our new seniors that have chosen unitedhealthcare what we are seeing is aligning to our expectations so we are not only pleased with what were seeing in  yeartodate but also our positioning as we look forward to  and we have a very positive longterm outlook for the industry and for us specifically we expect as you heard to continue to outperform the market in  overall on ma balanced both in group and individual just as we did this year and the two years prior the return of the insurance fee will be the single largest headwind in  its return was assumed that our  bid submissions but despite the return of the tax and program funding pressure there we do intend to keep our benefit offerings as stable as possible and we intend to compliment our  growth and product stability with advances in both quality and satisfaction so our products will again be designed for high levels of retention so on balance we are very optimistic we are optimistic about our positioning both group and individual against the backdrop of an advancing very positive industry growth outlook for  stephen j hemsley thank you next question operator the next question is from chris rigg with deutsche bank please go ahead chris rigg good morning i just wanted to ask or get a little more color on the operating cost ratio and just to better understand the mix dynamics there and i guess most importantly im trying to determine whether is there an incremental investment spending in the number related to the provider side or is that all just mix at this point thanks stephen j hemsley john john rex yes thanks john rex here so when i talked about the  basis points of impact that was truly just the mix impact a higher proportion of really care delivery businesses in our revenue base and thats the impact that were seeing in the business so that is straight up the care delivery business expanding and growing and care delivery business somewhere now in kind of two thirds of the range of all of optumhealth there are always investments were making across the businesses and certainly within our ocr this quarter there were plenty but our commitment to you is to always balance those and as we deliver our results by that point of segment the  basis points does not include investments that we make stephen j hemsley excellent next question please operator we will go next to peter costa with wells fargo peter costa hi thanks you mentioned the impact of the health insurance will be coming back next year if it does come back next year that turns into quite a price increase for the commercial planned staff to pay more than most businesses are growing these days so can you talk about what youre seeing employers do right now that counteract that rising cost in terms of what cost cutting measures are they putting in place and what cost cutting measures are you putting in place to help ameliorate the rate increase stephen j hemsley so maybe jeff alter and dan schumacher can you kind of combine on that jeff alter sure thanks peter its jeff alter you know a few years ago we put forth a very purposeful initiative to expand our portfolio of fully insured products which included broadening that portfolio to reach many different price points and then connecting those products with varying network structures so we have a very robust product portfolio that allows our clients to adjust to increasing medical costs whether that’s driven by pharmacy or driven by medical costs or driven by legislative and regulatory actions so our clients have the ability to create five down opportunities or to change in complimenting their benefit strategies without having to change their carrier because of the proactive work weve done in our product portfolio particularly in our fully insured product portfolio dan schumacher so i think variety of products and offerings and really focus on broad range of price points peter costa is there anything in particular thats being picked up more than not jeff alter you know i would say that theres far more interest in varying network constructs one of the more popular choice has been the leveraging of our more than a decade old premium designation program where we use lot of the optuminsight in analytics to determine the best providers those that practice both first and foremost always quality but then efficiency and so weve created network and product structures that drive people to those top tier doctors using either copay or coinsurance variations it has become very popular because it helps our clients achieve the price points that are affordable for them but also given the comfort that people are getting better outcomes at a lower cost and i think thats a real story of the integration of the unitedhealthcare and in optum to deliver meaningful value to a marketplace that first and foremost drives people to the best performing physicians but overall achieves a price point for their sponsors peter costa thanks that’s helpful thank you stephen j hemsley next question please operator we’ll go next to scott fidel with credit suisse please go ahead scott fidel thanks just had a question just on the tax rate i know theres been a few discrete items this year so first just if you have just an updated guidance for the tax rate this year and then what you would view as sort of a good sort of run rate tax rate looking out that we should be modeling for next year excluding obviously the return of the industry stephen j hemsley were so were going to not actually get into  too much but john do you want to respond john rex thanks scott john rex here i will speak to this year so were not updating our tax rate outlook for the year here let me just talk a little bit about within the quarter because we did speak about it last quarter also so there is nothing unusual that i would spike out in the q effective tax rate beyond normal exercise activity so typically with the share purchase  with stock based compensation accounting were going to see more impact in the first half and the second half in terms of lowering that tax rate so we’d expect that to increase in the second half in the first quarter we had really talked about half of the impact that we expected to be nonrecurring and that was really due to just an unusually large amount of stock option exercises it was related in part to an older acquisition and so that was the piece we spiked out there but i wouldnt spike out anything as unusual in this quarters rate and wed be at the still in that  zone we’d always try to do a little bit better than we can and that would be my aspiration but that’s what it would be scott fidel okay thanks stephen j hemsley next question please operator next to aj rice with ubs please go ahead aj rice hello everybody i just maybe ask about capital deployment john i think in your prepared remarks youre saying that you guys will hit your yearend target by the end of the third quarter for where you were hoping debt to cap would be theres been a lot of discussion in the press about your potentially being involved in various ma type of transactions supporting optum reliant advisory board etc i guess conceptually as you guys get to your debt to cap target do you  is the ma environment just so robust what youre seeing out there that your capital is going to continue to be mainly focus there do you see an opportunity to maybe reestablish more actively the buyback program give us some flavor for where you guys are thinking on capital deployment stephen j hemsley i think maybe dave wichmann would respond david s wichmann sure aj thank you for the question very thoughtful so youre right that our ambitions are to achieve our  leverage ratio by the end of the third quarter and we think we stand a really good shot at getting there which should be one quarter early john has done a very nice job in managing our capital structure and getting us into that position along with our team as you know we dont discuss rumors and speculation about our ma activity and were certainly not going to start today but i think as you know aj that ma has been a critical part of the way in which this organization has identified new opportunities to serve more people and more market broadly and those ambitions continue as steve lined out in his concluding remarks in the opening remarks around those ambitions being both domestic as well as global and really focused in the services category really continuing to support optums growth and diversification establishing platforms like you saw with optumcare which we believe will be strong growth performers for us for the next decade and i could go on and list many more but i think you get the idea so it is a core part of our emphasis as relates to share repurchase we continue with a consistent policy at this time whereby we are just trying to keep our share count level and as i believe you saw in june we increased our dividend again to a rate of  per share which is a  increase in continuing with our ambitions of advancing our dividend to a market rate level thank you stephen j hemsley next question please operator we will go next to josh raskin with barclays please go ahead joshua raskin hi thanks and good morning i wanted to ask about potential changes in tax rate and i understand its very premature we dont even have necessarily a real proposal from the republicans but to the extent that you guys have thought about it im curious what the impact on your tax rate is from the nondeductibility of the excess compensation how you would think about the introduction add back and then as i look about your tax rate sort of before the aca your tax rate today is running  to  basis points below where you were so just trying to sort of level set the opportunity were there to be changes and maybe specifically on those two items that we know have the potential to change stephen j hemsley you know josh we are really not going to try to get into themes that could affect  outlook but we would really prefer to do that not in a peaceful way but in a more fulsome way when we can really talk about all the elements the insurance tax is clearly if it has sustained a headwind influencing  and its progress of data really effects the cost for consumers in both  across the commercial medicare and medicaid markets etc and its a factor in terms of market  it is stabilizing factor in the marketplace both in its cost so the return of the tax making would further destabilize the market which is already fragile and make that market less affordable so we are we would clearly think that either repealing or deferring that would be a positive thing but as it relates to our actual workings with our  outlook or tax rate and so forth were just going to save those so that we can actually go through them with you in a more thoughtful way in a more complete way maybe to some extent in the third quarter but for sure at our investor conference joshua raskin do i get a mulligan then steve stephen j hemsley you do alright do you want a another joshua raskin i will pretend that didn’t happen so my next question would just be were talking about optumhealth and optumcare specifically were seeing a lot of discussion among competitors around growth in urgent care in ascs how would you describe the competitive landscape are you seeing more and more supply of like services in the market and is that impacting optumcare at all stephen j hemsley you know i think we are but i think others are better qualified to respond to that so maybe larry to begin and then andrew larry c renfro okay josh the  as you know when we put our program together when we started optumcare it was probably about  when we brought the optum business plan and so i would say we got out early in terms of how we were going to approach the market and how we were going to look at it from an investing standpoint or we would partner we would contract buy build so we had a lot of different strategies in terms of how we were going to really attack and put together our optumcare program so urgent care care delivery the surgery care house calls behavioral we have all of those programs in place and they are actually functioning extremely well and im going to let andrew talk about it but the one thing i would say is we are early but we have an established platform we didnt miss any boat here we are out and we understand the marketplace and we are in the process of a evaluating many different organizations on how we say that they fit with us and we have a very robust opportunity that we are seeing in the marketplace so with that i will turn it over to andrew andrew hayek thanks larry and good morning josh so i would say the local markets remain competitive in different ways in unique ways depending on the market structure but as we look across our optumcare platforms in physician groups the sca medexpress house calls the distinctive capabilities that we have really created demand for what we have to offer in improving the quality the cost the experience the care and improving the provider experience and so id say is the market force has continued to push towards higher quality at more cost effective price points the demand for a distinctive platform that can enable physicians and care providers to achieve better results leveraging tools and insight and other components of our platform the need for what we have to offer is growing and we remain very bullish and optimistic around the opportunity to expand across the  markets to deepen our presence in the markets we currently serve as larry referenced we believe we’re in the very early stages of this opportunity and again in many respects the increasing competition increases the demand for a distinctive platform which we have stephen j hemsley so maybe we could then give it to dan because that really kind of the voice of demand in there dan schumacher sure so josh one thing i would just highlight is obviously when you look at our spend and the composition of it and how much of it orients to the acute setting weve got so many surgical procedures and so forth that are happening in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings and the reality is weve seen for a long time an opportunity to really focus on the side of service get them into places where we can drive better quality frankly a better patient experience at a lower cost as andrew has been talking about and we do it in a couple of ways certainly we do it in terms of our approach to medical management so looking at prior authorization and making sure that were getting it into the right side of service on the front end before procedures are happening we are also building it into the product designs as well so that were putting incentives in there to make some of the transition from acute to ambulatory to really drive the kind of outcomes that were looking for and more recently with the acquisition of sca and our partnership there we are really leaning into that and investing in quality incentives for surgeons so that we can drive greater volumes into these less intensive settings and were able to do frankly more acute procedures and more complicated procedures in that setting as well so we see a lot of opportunity in it weve got it in place in select markets today and we will be looking to expand that meaningfully over the course of this year and into next so those are some of the things that were doing around both the plan design the medical management as well as the incentives to put those three things together in alignment to drive those transitions from acute settings to ambulatory settings to drive better cost value and experience larry larry c renfro i’d just like to add one other aspect of the optum business and that would be optum sometimes we forget that on the primary care side the urgent care and now what were doing with surgery care across the board we have strategic relationships with a lot of the optum clients that are actually involved with us in using those programs and so we get caught up in terms of talking about how were looking at our different programs in optumcare mainly from a health plan standpoint when the optum organizations are actively engaged with how we tie into them as well so thats a whole other avenue of our business there stephen j hemsley thank you next question please operator we’ll go next to ralph giacobbe with citigroup please go ahead ralph giacobbe thanks good morning you know there has been headlines around states potentially tying medicaid contracts to exchange participation so just want to get your thoughts on that and then with procurements coming up how concerned are you that states consider exchange participation even if not explicitly and how could that influence your views around reentering the exchange thanks stephen j hemsley maybe well have austin begin to comment with respect to safe base to dead end austin pittman so i guess first and foremost these are really state by state discussions and not something that were really going to comment broadly here and not going to speculate about that i would say with regard to your second question we are constantly in conversations with our states on how to expand coverage for more people particularly those with complex needs a lot of the activity that we see both in renewal activity as well as new business certainly surrounds that which as we talked about before is a real area of distinction for the combination of optum and unitedhealthcare so were very positive we look forward to continue to serve our states and find solutions particularly get around these populations with very complex needs stephen j hemsley so well continue to work with state and so forth but i dont see anything that establishes what might be a trend with respect to tying these kinds of programs together states have been i think very thoughtful about this to date so i think thats the best response we can offer at the moment next question operator our next question is from sarah james with piper jaffrey please go ahead sarah james thank you stephen what we know now about medicare market indiscernible could the market see a continuation of the  and then penetration increase that we saw in  and longterm given the inherent value proposition at medicare advantage where do you think penetration is heading with the potential market that is  ma stephen j hemsley maybe i will have steve respond to that but i think weve been pretty consistent in the past that we do expect that penetration to go forward and we do expect the ma market to mature and grow steve nelson good morning sarah steve nelson i agree with steves high level comments there i have seen clearly in our experience we have seen tremendous growth in our medicare advantage and while that clearly we think is driven by some of the things that we uniquely bring to the market whether its the stability or benefits the product designs the service and the clinical models but also in addition to that theres just a real strong overall value proposition with medicare advantage and were seeing that not only just with the folks that we serve but as we talk to policy makers too theres really strong support for it so you see a population that needs it it serves them well it drives down cost the satisfaction is up its definitely growing and so we think thats going to continue and so we do think theres an opportunity to further advance the penetration of the medicare advantage where it can go hard to tell but i dont think its unreasonable to think about something north of  considerably north of where we are about  approaching  it doesnt seem like a unreasonable idea to us no i would think that we would think that it could go  or better stephen j hemsley next question please operator we go next to matthew borsch with bmo capital markets matthew borsch yes thank you and im going to ask a question that sort of asked before but just as you know had started with your comment but youve added  group commercial risk lives yearoveryear i just wanted to understand i mean youre obviously doing better than almost all your competitors most of whom are seeing attrition on the group commercial risks and i guess the question you described your pricing i think john did as disciplined and rational which im not disputing my question is is this really just that you are producing a better medical cost outcome and so you can price lower than the market because a lot of this business you can correct me if i am wrong it moves unpriced sorry for the long question stephen j hemsley so i think that we started to get into this a little bit before when jeff alter was commenting it is i think a function of many things of which cost structure is clearly part of it but its spectrum of products the design etc so jeff do you want to respond jeff alter sure hey matt i guess i would try in my response to kind of a discussion of whats here so i would say the market moves on value it doesnt necessarily move on price and we have been very purposeful across our product our services the focus on nps has i think brought a much stronger value proposition to particularly the fully insured small growth market longterm disciplined pricing is a good thing and i think youre seeing the discipline that we had in the early stages of the aca now coming back to us as a value play couple that with a very purposeful decision a number of years ago to broaden our product portfolio and to offer a much broader spectrum of network opportunities or choice for particularly our fully insured small group clients we also have undertaken a different view with our distribution community our brokers and consultants a more disciplined approach with them narrowing some of that distribution network to more favorite partners and giving them some added services so one of the things that weve learned over the years that our brokers and our consultants in that marketplace seek to do business with those that make it easier for them to do business with weve created again with the assistance of rally and our optum partners a much easier way for our small business brokers to onboard clients with us to make plan changes to recommend using some of the optuminsight analytics the next logical moves for buy down so you really have to look at the value we bring as opposed to the price of our product i think it maps the answer to why our particularly our small group fully insured business has done well over the last few years matthew borsch thank you stephen j hemsley thank you next question please operator we go next to ana gupte with leerink partners please go ahead ana gupte yes thanks good morning on optum you saw some really nice margin expansion on optumhealth and optumrx despite the mix shifting pressures you talked about on providers i was just wondering if this is an area of focus for the organization or this is one off and where could the margins shake out by business line and overall stephen j hemsley larry maybe you want to respond to that clearly an area of focus right larry c renfro it is an area of focus and ana we’re obviously youre looking at both from a financial perspective as well from a margin perspective and all that is in line with our expectations i am going to ask tim to tim wicks to comment on this tim wicks sure thanks ana first as we think about the margin growth that were seeing since we had  we’re pleased to start a very strong start to the year  the earnings are in line with our expectations june yeartodate and comprise about  of the full year expectations and so right in line with both our prior several years of experience in the first half of the year as well as our  guidance i think its also important to understand that theres seasonality in our businesses and maybe ill just point two examples where theres some seasonality one is in optuminsight as you know the second half of the year is typically pretty strong and in terms of the relative distribution of earnings growth in the year and its really driven by several other businesses in optuminsight quality and the risk businesses the optum content sales as well as technology data and software sales the second example i would use is in optumhealth as well is when we look at optumhealth sca volume is characteristically also stronger in the second half of the year and then typically we expect fourth quarter overall for optum to be stronger than the third quarter as well as we go through the year stephen j hemsley thank you we’ll do two more questions and then well have to close it so we will do two more questions first operator well go to sheryl skolnick with mizuho please go ahead sheryl skolnick thank you very much for keeping me in so ill just observe that if this is early stage growth for  billion revenue run rate company to produce what youre producing id like to see what late stage looks like so thank you for that but the real question i have here is that ive learned overtime to pay close attention to what is said on this call and one of the things that you mentioned steve early on in your remarks was that words to the effect of it is now time to turn our attention to cost in the past when youve turned the organizations attention to something its resulted in significant advances for the business enterprise as a whole and im wondering if this is one of those things that we should be paying attention to and if so if you can quantify it in any way or qualify it in any way to give us a sense of where the opportunities are i know weve discussed it from the optumcare perspective but more broadly across the enterprise would be helpful thank you stephen j hemsley im not sure i can offer you too much specifics but that was intentional i think that in general if you take a look at our organization we have grown well over the last couple of years weve been able to add some and introduce some strong companies into our portfolio and i think that if you see the growth and in essence the net productivity out of that you’d sit back and say theres an opportunity to strengthen the enterprise continue to lead the enterprise focused on the things that are most important and if you recognize the value equation as its played out in the marketplace many of todays themes were around retention of customers value to customers and so forth as one of the questioners pointed out the price point is a very important part of this we have to challenge ourselves to deliver value all the time were in a very strong position this is a great time to be taking that challenge up and that is what were focused on we think we can deliver more value we think we can drive more innovation fresh approaches and i think this enterprises folks who are ready to do that the alignment of new technologies to that effort use of more advanced data analytics produce a lot of opportunity for us particularly just given the set up of our businesses so those are the themes around that and we are focused on our marketplace thats going to be looking for value and think that we can anticipate that i think nps is a big part of that effort as well thank you for the question next last question please operator and well go to zack sopcak with morgan stanley please go ahead zack sopcak hey good morning thank you i wanted to ask about cms’s proposal to remove knee arthroplasty from the inpatient only list was that something that you considered happening in the near term when you are in the stages of acquiring sca and how do you think about the impact of that business over a longer term is it meaningful and does that have any impact on your ma strategy going forward andrew hayek it’s andrew id offer a couple comments here from an sca perspective the team there has been focusing on higher acuity procedures for several years in orthopedics in spine in cardiovascular and that includes total joint replacements which the sca team has been performing on a commercial basis for a number of years with outstanding results very consistent with the aaa in terms of the quality outcomes the patient experience and of course material cost savings so weve been applying that in the commercial environment and theres been discussion for a number of years at the cms level around the potential to allow total joint replacement in the surgery center setting which we of course would embrace allowing us to extend the benefits of that platform in terms of quality experience and obviously reducing total cost and extend that to the medicare population so in many ways we have been anticipating this this is something on a commercial basis weve been doing we can obviously speculate as to how  what the outcome will be but this is a positive and consistent with the strategy weve been pursuing stephen j hemsley so thank you thank you once again for your interest in our progress today kind of midway through the year our performance and momentum remain strong we expect to continue to deliver higher quality and value in healthcare and sustainable growth throughout   and the years to come our thanks to our people who through their commitment to our mission and culture are helping to drive our enterprise to reach its full potential thank you and that concludes our

youve never heard of but health care for america now hcan hopes to change that hemsley is the ceo of unitedhealth group the nations largest insurance company in terms of revenue last year it made  billion in revenues and  billion in profits it ranked no  on fortunes list of largest corporations about  million americans get their health insurance from unitedhealth headquartered in a minneapolis suburb in  the company paid hemsley  million in  last year he had to get by on only  million fortunately for hemsley he has his own rainyday fund he owns  million in unexercised stock options despite the pay cut hemsleys job comes with quite a few perks he travels on unitedhealths corporate jet a gulfstream aerospace which cost  million and he lives in a lakeside mansion in suburban wayzata minnesota valued at  million by the hennepin county assessor last thursday fifty protesters holding umbrellas and candles stood outside helmsleys mansion in the rain and screened a video that contrasted his exorbitant income and lifestyle and unitedhealths huge profits with the millions of americans who go without insurance or bankrupt themselves with medical bills hcan has tried to buy time to broadcast the video on cnn but the network refuses to air it and no reporters or tv cameras showed up thursday at the vigil outside hemsleys house so yesterday hcan  a coalition of community organizations religious groups consumer advocates senior citizen groups unions and medical professionals  tried again around  am about  people in two yellow school buses pulled up in front of unitedhealths headquarters in suburban minnetonka the protesters held up signs with the names of victims of insurance industry neglect and described how the industrys profitsoverpeople priorities caused emotional financial and physical havoc on their families we know that if the insurance companies win we lose said rev grant stevenson of st matthews lutheran church in st paul and president of isaiah an activist group affiliated with hcan theres a choice to be made and congress needs to be on our side congress needs to stand with you and with me and with the people that we care about the insurance companies cannot continue to direct the way that health care is delivered and paid for in this country its wrong six of the protesters locked arms sat down on the sidewalk  and blocked the entrance to the building the police soon arrived handcuffed them and took them to the hennepin county jail they did not resist arrest and were cited for trespassing see a video of the protest the protest is one of about  demonstrations sponsored by hcan at insurance company offices around the country this week were here today at unitedhealth group to stop business as usual said tee mcclenty an emergency room technician at st johns hospital in maplewood business as usual for hemsley and unitedhealth is a chronic pattern of abuse and neglect of its policyholders along with a powerful political influencepeddling operation that involves costly campaign contributions and lobbying expenses designed to protect its profits and thwart congress from passing reform legislation unitedhealth group is one of the insurance industry giants leading the charge against president barack obamas plan to create a public option  essentially an expansion of medicare for working families  to create more competition and give consumers more choices ironically unitedhealth group is one of a handful of insurance companies that have a virtual iron grip on the insurance market in almost every state the american medical association reports that  percent of insurance markets in more than  metropolitan areas are now highly concentrated unitedhealth group is one of the two largest insurers in  states including maryland north carolina missouri louisiana george nebraska arizona colordo iowa arkansas wyoming and rhole island where one or two companies dominate the market insurance corporations like unitedhealth can drive up premiums restrict coverage and take advantage of consumers nationwide health insurance premiums have been rising much faster than family incomes no wonder unitedhealth wants to quash potential competition from a public option to thwart such competition and to limit government regulation of its practices unitedhealth has utilized its warchest  dollars it gets from the families and businesses paying skyhigh premiums  to wield political influence according to the nonpartisan public campaign unitedhealth group employees and associates have contributed over  million to federal political campaigns over the past two and a half years the corporation has spent  million lobbying washington over the same time period just during the first half of this year according to business week united health spent more than  million on inhouse and outside lobbying not surprisingly these legal bribes arent given out randomly they include donations to key members of the senate and house with influence over health care policy in  united health hired judah sommer who had run goldman sachs lobbying operation to head its influencepeddling effort one of his first hires was cory alexander former chief of staff for house majority leader steny hoyer dmd a moderate sommer oversees a staff of about  people in unitedhealths washington dc office on pennsylvania avenue equidistant between the capitol and white house observed business week in a recent article on the industrys political clout sommer also retained tom daschle the former democratic senate leader and now a lobbyist who has advised unitedhealth  off and on since   tom strickland recently shifted jobs from unitedhealths executive vice president and chief legal officer to chief of staff for obamas secretary of the interior ken salazar according to business week unitedhealths relationship with democratic senator mark r warner of virginia illustrates the industrys subtle role elected last fall warner a former governor of his state and a wealthy exbusinessman received a choice assignment as the senate democrats liaison to business the rookie senator landed in the center of a highvisibility political dramaand in a position to earn the gratitude of a health insurance industry that has donated more than  million to federal candidates since   of which has gone to democrats unitedhealth has periodically served as a valuable extension of warners office providing research and analysis to support his initiatives corporations and trade groups play this role in all kinds of contexts but few do it with the effectiveness of the insurers in june warner introduced legislation expanding governmentbacked medicare and medicaid coverage for hospice stays for the terminally ill and other treatment in lifes final stages the issue isnt a top unitedhealth priority but the corporation wanted to help warner with his argument that in the long run better hospice coverage would save money unitedhealth prepared a report for lawmakers finding that  of medicares budget is now spent during the last year of older patients lives often on questionable hospital tests and procedures expanded hospice coverage and other services could save  billion over  years unitedhealth asserted when warner went to the senate floor on june  to offer his bill he cited those exact figures he thanked the company for its support and put a letter from unitedhealth applauding him in the congressional record unitedhealth is dead set against congress passing a public option to help make its case unitedhealth owns a consulting firm called the lewin group based in falls church virginia many senators including republicans orin hatch and charles grassley and representatives including house republican whip eric cantor of virginia frequently cite a statistic provided by john sheils claiming that  million people or  of those with employerprovided coverage would desert private insurance for a governmentrun program shells works for the lewin group a fact that grassley hatch and others conveniently overlook the nonpartisan congressional budget office says that shells figures are much too high  ceo hemsley is an accountant by training before joining unitedhealth he worked at arthur andersen the giant accounting firm where he was managing partner and chief financial officer he joined united health in  and worked his way up to ceo by  upon moving into the unitedhealth ceo office hemsley had a lot of accounting to do the wall street journal reported that unitedhealths corporate management backdated hundreds of millions of stock options with the approval of the board of directors the reports and investigations forced thenceo william w mcguire to resign and give up hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options despite the scandal mcguires golden parachute  from unitedhealth was reported to be around  billion the largest in corporate american history hemsley too was caught in the controversy and had to surrender  million in stock options himself but held onto his job last year in fact the minneapolis startribune reported that hemsley was more involved in the handling of backdated stock options than previously revealed according to new documents filed in a shareholder lawsuit that is moving toward a fall trial a review conducted by a firm hired by unitedhealth cleared hemsley of any wrongdoing but the lawsuit filed by the california public employees retirement system calpers states that hemsley personally offered backdated options to new hires was required to approve all grants in excess of  shares and approved backdated mass grants last year unitedhealth was caught in another scandal one of its subsidiaries ingenix determines the customary rates for medical care for health insurance companies  a likely conflictofinterest right there  health insurance plans maintain the right to deny coverage if the cost for medical care is too high  that is not customary because of this practice critics have accused ingenix of using the system to deny coverage new york attorney general andrew m cuomo conducted an investigation of the company and discovered that ingenix had set its rates  lower than the typical cost of medical expenses according to the washington post cuomos report said that ingenix had an incentive to produce benchmarks that lowballed usual and customary rates and shifted costs from insurers to their customers this allowed insurance companies to inappropriately deny coverage unitedhealth settled a  million class action lawsuit brought by the american medical association unitedhealth members and others last month consumer watchdog a nonprofit nonpartisan group that advocates for taxpayer and consumer interests accused unitedhealth and wellpoint the nations two largest health insurers of pressuring employees to lobby against healthcare reform in congress in violation of a california law against coerced political activity consumer watchdog asked california atty gen jerry brown to investigate its claim that unitedhealth group and wellpoint inc pushed workers to write their elected officials attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches their interests according to one report unitedhealth group encouraged its employees to attend an antihealth care reform rally sponsored by rightwing tea party activists outside the office of rep zack space doh testifying before congress hemsley assured legislators that our mission at unitedhealth group is to help people live healthier lives but a number of united healths members have publicly criticized the company for abuse and neglect one of them is froma harrop a syndicated columnist for the providence ri journal  earlier this year she wrote about the battle her husband fought with both liver cancer and unitedhealth he lost his battle with both death panels ill tell you about death panels my husband faced one some years ago and it didnt involve any government bureaucrat it was run by our private insurer their doctor recommended treatment provided by deaconess hospital in boston but unitedhealth denied to pay for it we naively tried to go through unitedhealthcares appeals process we would call the number and speak to a handler who said our case would be reconsidered days later a onesentence letter would arrive by slow mail saying that we were being denied but call this number to challenge the verdictaround and around we went we could never speak to anyone making the decisions no one would even talk to our doctor who at one point whispered to us mortgage the house i became convinced that the insurance company was trying to run out the clock on my husbands life had it issued an outright no we would have gone to deaconess paid for the care ourselves and fought the insurer later but it always pretended that a possible yes could be around the corner harrops husband was a former marine who she described as a tough customer toward the end of his battle he told her you know fighting the insurance company was worse than fighting the cancer harrop concluded believe me death panels already exist and they have nothing to do with the government a new sixminute video by brave new films documents other unitedhealth members who were victimized by the giant insurer in addition to hemsley unitedhealths board of directors includes douglas w leatherdale  former ceo of the st paul companies currently known as travelers companies inc a property casualty insurance company and a

freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for

easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
