optimal marketing entry timing for successive productservice generations insead working paper no mkt  pages posted  sep    zhengrui jiang iowa state university  college of businessdipak c jain marketing insead date written september   abstract when to introduce successive generations of products or services to the market is an important decision for firms in this study we develop analytical models to help decide the optimal market entry timing for each generation our analysis is very comprehensive in that we consider two commonly observed revenue streams ie revenue is generated from either onetime sale or continuous service and two generation transition strategies ie older generation are either gradually phased out or totally replaced pioneering research models by wilson and norton  and mahajan and muller  have considered the specific business scenario corresponding to onetime sale and phaseout transition results of these studies conclude that a second generation should be introduced now or never wilson and norton  or now or at maturity mahajan and muller  we find that under onetime sale and phaseout transition the optimal entry timing is not limited to now or never or now or at maturity but it can also lie between now and maturity interestingly when continuous service instead of onetime sale is the source of revenue and the new generation is less profitable than the older per unit time’s service the now or never pattern is observed lastly we demonstrate that the proposed modeling framework can be easily used to derive market entry timing for more general business scenarios where a revenue is generated from both onetime sale and continuous service and b there exist three product generations which also extend previous research keywords multigeneration

the discriminating consumer kellogg school of management at northwestern university logo marketing nov   subscribe share print email twitter linkedin facebook cite discriminating prices for the discriminating consumermaximize profitability with different package sizesbased on the research of romana j khan and dipak c jain with sales and profits dependent upon the prices retailers set for their products a too generous discount or a too lengthy sales promotion can destroy a business as a result retailers are constantly searching for better pricing strategies a report in the journal of marketing research from dipak jain dean kellogg school of management and romana khan university of texas graduate of the kellogg school’s doctoral program in marketing methodically describes how varying prices can improve profitability by taking advantage of differences in demand for different package sizes from one store to another“we thought ‘how can price be used to segment different customers so that they’ll see value they like and be willing to pay the price’” said jain professor of marketing and the sandy and morton goldman professor of entrepreneurial studies “so we looked at optimal schemes and combinations”a seller who charges different prices for the same good is said to engage in price discrimination price discrimination focuses not on differences based on race gender or religion but on differences in customers’ preferences for products or services sellers attempt to increase profits by matching prices of products to customers’ willingness to pay in a nondiscriminating market—one with just one price for a product—some customers would be willing to pay even more and others would buy the product only if it were a bit cheaper in both cases money that could be spent by customers is not spent by recognizing different demands and sensitivities among consumers and adjusting prices accordingly price discrimination segments the market providing more attractive options to more customers and making them more likely to buyin the s and s english economist arthur pigou outlined three degrees of price discrimination in the purest type firstdegree discrimination the price varies with every sale as the vendor tries to squeeze as much as possible from each customer this occurs when buyers and sellers haggle over the prices of mangoes and rugs in a bustling outdoor market while common in some cultures firstdegree discrimination is relatively rare in advanced economies because the seller must work relentlessly with every customer to reap the maximum each is willing to pay khan and jain focused on the patterns and impact of second and thirddegree price discrimination which are far more common in most economiesin seconddegree discrimination the price of a good depends on its quantity the restaurateur loading her truck with gallon jugs of mayonnaise can pay a fraction per ounce compared to the bachelor buying a few ounces for yet another solitary dinner of tuna salad while some of this difference in retail price is dictated by the wholesale cost retailers pay for volume products discrimination is an explicit strategy to alter retail price beyond what is needed to simply recoup differences in wholesale cost this nonlinear pricing strategy the “bulk discount” in which twice as much stuff does not cost twice as much money segments the market by allowing more customers to find appealing sizeprice combinations“the real application of this is walmart” said jain “why have they been so successful they offer quantitybased segmentation not quality segmentation they offer brandname value but you have to buy a larger size than you would buy at a supermarket”thirddegree price discrimination or micromarketing exploits differences in demand from one community to the next by varying prices from store to store anyone who has saved a few cents by buying toothpaste and batteries at the kmart across town rather than the kmart down the block has experienced the third degree of price discrimination“with storebased pricing there’s a sense of arbitrage you cannot prevent that” said jain acknowledging the inherent imbalance between markets that is exploited in thirddegree discrimination “textbooks for example may cost less in india than they do in the us because indians aren’t willing to pay  for a textbook”while second and thirddegree price discrimination have been recognized and practiced for decades there is sparse empirical evidence of their relative impact on demand and profit khan and jain created mathematical models to study how several factors including product size and store location influenced sales they then were able to predict how second and thirddegree price discrimination separately and together could impact profitskhan and jain scoured twelve month’s worth of data from dominick’s finer foods a popular chicagoarea grocery chain they focused on each store’s weekly sales prices and profits for four brands of nonprescription painkillers tylenol acetaminophen advil ibuprofen bayer aspirin and dominick’s house brand the market for overthecounter painkillers holds great promise for retail grocers with annual sales growing to almost  billion in  as more drugs are granted nonprescription statuseach painkiller came in three package sizes   and  tablets so few people bought the dominick’s brand tablet package however that khan and jain focused on the eleven other products which accounted for  percent of nonprescription painkillers sold the variations in package size and corresponding price revealed dominick’s seconddegree price discrimination strategy with price per tablet decreasing dramatically as packages got larger for example the total price of four tablet packages of bayer was over twice as much as a single package of  tabletsin addition to information about product size and price which allowed study of seconddegree price discrimination khan and jain also studied stores’ locations and the types of customers they served such information is key to understanding thirddegree price discrimination they analyzed features like the distance from each store to various competitors such as chicagoarea rival jewelosco to understand the typical clientele at each store they studied features of the neighborhood such as the percentage of people over age sixty the percentage of racial minorities the number of people in an average household and the percentage of homes valued at over as expected when prices increased demand generally waned closer analyses however revealed variations in this relationship depending on store location for example increased prices reduced demand more in neighborhoods with many older people and large households than it did in affluent areas where consumers were more likely to buy regardless of price such findings suggest that thirddegree price discrimination varying prices from one neighborhood to another based on socioeconomic factors should prove profitablein general consumers preferred smaller packages to larger but again store location influenced this preference for example shoppers in neighborhoods with more large households had a stronger preference for large sizes while consumers in largely minority communities preferred smaller sizes possibly reflecting strained budgets such findings suggest pricing strategies that consider both package size and store location second and thirddegree discrimination should prove successfulsince it is practically impossible to identify every factor that might influence someone’s decision to buy a product kahn and jain allowed some “wiggle room” in their mathematical model said jain “any scientific model depends on certain assumptions we tried to relax those assumptions as much as possible” indeed some patterns of consumer preference could not be traced back to measured factors such as product size and store location so they must have reflected the influence of some unknown features for example jain speculated “some customers might not have space in their house to store that much so they won’t buy that much” the need for retailers to provide products that are attractive to the complex tastes and motivations of consumers highlights yet another reason to offer several variations of a product through price discrimination as jain said “let the customer decide what is best for him or her”armed with this evidence of relationships between product sizes store locations and consumer demand khan and jain were able to calculate the specific influences of second and thirddegree price discrimination on profits see table  they estimated that dominick’s weekly store profits would bottom out at  down from  if the company switched from its existing pricing strategy to one that ignored discrimination altogether keeping the price per pill the same across all package sizes and all stores in contrast combining second and thirddegree price discrimination could increase profits by roughly  percent topping off at  per week but seconddegree discrimination alone could improve upon the nondiscriminating strategy by nearly  percent lifting profits to  while thirddegree discrimination alone could raise profits by only around  percent to this work clearly shows that while a combination of second and thirddegree discrimination is optimal the benefit of offering only quantity discounts is far greater than that of storetostore pricing alone in addition to having a greater impact on profit seconddegree discrimination is much easier to implement central managers can save time and effort by focusing on a single set of prices to be applied across all stores rather than tweaking prices from one neighborhood to the next“many people will say ‘this doesn’t surprise me’” acknowledged jain “but the real beauty of the paper is that it’s a methodological demonstration of why this works and how it can be done it’s no longer hearsay or intuition”encouraged by these findings jain described plans to expand upon and apply this research “i’m now looking at how price promotions can be a way to prevent cannibalization” he said “suppose you offer product x then launch product y if some of your customers who bought x switch to y you’ve cannibalized your own x”“for example” continued jain “a single company owns gap old navy and banana republic let’s devise a price mechanism such that a gap customer might buy from banana republic but won’t go to old navy thinking he or she can get the premium value at a cheaper price you want customers to trade up not down”in the vibrant world of retail sales where striking the right balance between such “traders up” and “traders down” can mean the difference between bonuses and bankruptcy this work by khan and jain adds some much needed rigor to our understanding of some traditional pricing practices more articles in marketing podcast why are
