investors wednesday december   share  chinese savers are increasingly turning away from the mainlands traditional banking system lured by the shadow banking sectors promise of significantly higher yields despite the dramatic title shadow banking is essentially just a name for financial institutions that operate outside the traditional heavily regulated banking sector its largest segment the trust industry has seen explosive growth in recent years as of the end of june the amount of outstanding trust assets in china had reached rmb trillion us trillion according to the china trustee associations latest report pdf thats equivalent about half of the countrys gdp in   however few of those jumping ship from traditional savings seem aware of exactly where their money is going or how safe it is getting a handle on just what the trust industry is made up of and what its up to can help shed light on its actual role in the chinese economy and the risk it may pose to the general publics pocketbook makes and models put simply a trust is a basket of assets including anything from loans to property to stocks to bonds trust companies then split the financial exposure to these assets into securities known as trust products which are then sold to investors there are a variety of different trust products in the chinese market today and in order to understand the range available they can be broken down in terms of structure and industry for structure types of trust products include • a single unit trust where the trust company creates a product based on the requirements of the customer • a combined trust in which a product is developed by the company and then marketed to investors • a property management trust a broadly defined product which involves the management of nonmonetary assets on behalf of the client such as physical assets or intangible assets the major industries for such products include industrial and commercial infrastructure real estate and finance among others wealth management products  areas of investment rmb billions rank  industry  balance june  balance change  multiindustry     other finance     busines services

pdf the breakneck growth of the trust industry—with assets under management increasing by an average of  a year for the past three years according to a column from reuters—is unsurprising given that they typically pay more than double the  maximum oneyear deposit rate that savers can get from mainland banks indeed the average annualized return to investors in trust products in the first half of  was  according to data from bloomberg such a profound gap in investment yield is luring more and more individuals and companies away from traditional bank deposits fundamentally changing the way the chinese populace holds its savings of the funds raised for trust products a quarter comes from wealthy individuals and companies with the remainder from banks selling the trust products as wealth management products wmps to individual savers according to one report from the wall street journal rate expectations many including the international monetary fund have expressed concern over the risk such products may pose to investors and the economy at large in light of such large premiums over the deposit rate strictly speaking just because trust products offer a higher return compared to chinas statecontrolled deposit rate doesnt mean they are necessarily riskier the returns could in theory be an approximation of what the real deposit rate might be without a governmentimposed ceiling but chinese trust products go above and beyond making up for this gap with returns outstripping levels one might expect from an ordinary deposit this suggests a significant risk premium is entailed by investing in these products the most important factor contributing to this risk is the mismatch between shortterm funds and longerterm investments while many trust products only last for two to three years borrowers may not be able to repay borrowings in such a short timeframe especially those in the mining and infrastructure industries according to a reuters report the two reports on the industry produced so far by the national banking wealth management registration system overseen by the china banking regulatory commission show heavy investment in bonds  currency cash  deposits and nonstandardized creditor assets wealth management products  types of assets held asset class invested in dec   jun   bond market  currency   cash and deposits   non standardized credit assets   equity   financial derivatives   other assets   qualified domestic institutional investor   wealth management direct financing tools   credit asset transfer project   goods and other assets   sources china banking industry wealth management market yearend reports for pdf pdf note nonstandardized credit assets include creditor assets that are traded outside bank and stock exchange markets including but not limited to credit assets trust loans entrusted loans acceptance bills letters of credit accounts receivable and equity financing with a buyback clause this leads to the broader question how much risk is posed by the borrowers of all this cash most trust companies have ostensibly sound assets but the trust sector can attract companies desperate for cash such as overextended real estate mining and local government developers and while trust products are sold under the umbrella term of wealth management products wmps through major banks the banks dont always guarantee them one notorious example came in  when customers of huaxia bank who had been sold a wmp were told they would not be getting their money back chinese media portrayed it as a oneoff event but there have been several cases this year of trusts on the verge of default or who have delayed investor payouts  as for exactly who is stuffing all these assets into the baskets there are around seventy members of the china trustee association the largest members of which include the trust companies citic trust china foreign economy and trade trust china credit trust pingan trust and yingda international trust according to kpmg pdf companies in the industry are mostly either stateowned local governmentcontrolled or have a large pool of diversified shareholders comprising governmentowned and privatelyowned businesses as a result of growing oversight by the pbrc corporate governance in the industry at least appears to be steadily improving a ratings system is used by the regulator to oversee trust companies in which companies with lower scores are subject to more regular and stringent oversight and restrictions of course that may not guarantee the actual safety of these products for ordinary consumers as anyone familiar with the role of credit rating agencies in the us subprime mortgage crisis of  can attest to ♦ authors francis zhao hudson lockett ryan henderson banking  financebusiness
