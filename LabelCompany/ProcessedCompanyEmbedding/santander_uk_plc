uk plc  asa  cap sign in  sign up menu asa ruling on santander uk plc upheld television  may  add to my favourites share page home codes and rulings rulings santander uk plc ad description a tv ad for santanders all in one credit card seen on  november  showed customers in a shop choosing a computer game a group of friends watching a tv programme a man at home scrolling through holiday photos on a tablet a couple discussing their finances and their young daughter playing a drum kit the voiceover stated with the new santander all in one credit card you get cashback on all your purchases  theres no fee when spending abroad  and  on balance transfers for  months  get a little bit more out of life with the new santander all in one credit card buy online or in branch today simple simple personal fair its what a bank should be onscreen text stated  cashback retailer and atm fees may apply abroad  balance transfer fee representative example  pa on purchases for  months then  pa variable equivalent to  apr representative variable based on £ credit limit monthly fee £ issue a viewer challenged whether the ad breached the code because the representative apr annual percentage rate was not given adequate prominence as required response santander uk plc said their understanding of the financial conduct authoritys fca consumer credit sourcebook conc was that the ad needed to include a representative example re of credit because it contained an indication of a rate of interest and an amount relating to the cost of credit their understanding was that the representative annual percentage rate rapr should not be given greater prominence than any other element of the re and that the re itself should have no less prominence than the incentive for taking out credit or any other information relating to the cost of creditsantander believed the re was clearly identified in the ad as such was clear and legible and was on the screen from the start of the ad which gave viewers adequate time to read it they did not believe there was anything in the ad which included the visual footage of customers and people in other situations which increased the prominence of the incentive for taking out credit or other information relating to the cost of credit they believed the information about the key features and benefits of the card ie cashback on all purchases no fees applied when spending abroad and  on balance transfers for  months was likely to be understood simply as product information rather than comparisons with other productssantander said they had used bold text to state the key elements of the re and rapr together with the size of the font and the length of time for which it was on the screen they believed that made the re and rapr equally prominent as the incentives which were stated in the voiceover they said that in consumer testing they had carried out in the past respondents said they would read text if they were interested in the product being advertised that the longer the words were on the screen and the larger they were the more likely they would notice them that numbers were more likely to be noticed than words and that short points were more noticeable than long they also believed it was important to take into account how compelling fastmoving or colourful the visual footage was santander said they had borne those points in mind in this ad and believed it would not be in line with conc to make the rapr any more prominentclearcast said that having sought confirmation from santanders compliance team that the ad complied with conc they believed that because the three apr figures were appropriately highlighted in a bolder font than the text either side of it the text was legible was onscreen for sufficient time and that the incentives to take out credit were no more prominent than the rate of interest assessment upheldthe asa noted that conc rule   stated that an ad must include a rapr if it included amongst other elements an incentive to apply for credit or a favourable comparison relating to the creditwe considered that in the context of an ad that invited consumers to apply for a credit card cashback on all purchases and no fee when spending abroad were likely to be seen as incentives to apply for credit and also as favourable comparisons with other credit providers who might not offer those features we noted that the ad featured three interest rates   and the rapr consequently requirements to include a rapr as well as a re were triggeredwe noted that conc rules   in relation to the rapr and  d in relation to the re stated that the rapr and the re must be given no less prominence than the information which triggered their inclusion in the ad the rapr and the re were presented in onscreen text which included other information and was present along the bottom of the screen for half of the ads duration we considered the size of the text and the time for which it was onscreen was sufficient for it to be clear to viewers and we noted the reasons santander had given for believing the ad was complianthowever we noted that the ad included visual footage that showed customers making purchases in a shop scrolling through holiday photographs and having discussions about their finances the ad also invited consumers to apply for a credit card that included cashback on purchases no fee when spending abroad and  on balance transfers for  months among its features in the context of this ad we considered the visual footage emphasised and therefore added prominence to the features being stated in the voiceover in that context we considered the information communicated to viewers in onscreen text was likely to be seen as less prominent than information communicated verbally with or without additional visual emphasis and that in this case the use of onscreen text to present the rapr and re was unlikely to meet concs requirements that it be given no less prominence than the information which triggered their inclusion for that reason we concluded that the ad breached the codethe ad breached bcap code rule    the advertising of unsecured consumer credit or hire services by consumer credit businesses or consumer hire businesses and  or credit brokering  businesses or related credit services such as debt counselling or debt adjusting is acceptable only if the advertiser complies with the financial promotions requirements imposed by fsma and the fcas rules set out in chapter  of conc  the requirements for financial promotions set out in chapter  of conc do not apply a

agreements or pp lending agreements for the purposes of a customers business c to a financial promotion to the extent that it relates to qualifying credit or d it falls within the definition of an excluded communication as set out in the fcas handbook if the applicability or interpretation of these rules or provisions is in doubt advertisers may contact the fca the fca does not check financial
