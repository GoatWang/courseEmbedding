justice office of public affairs for immediate release thursday december   teva pharmaceutical industries ltd agrees to pay more than  million to resolve foreign corrupt practices act charges companies agree to pay nearly  million to us criminal and regulatory authorities representing the largest criminal fine imposed against a pharmaceutical company for violations of the fcpa teva pharmaceutical industries ltd teva the world’s largest manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products and its whollyowned russian subsidiary teva llc teva russia agreed to resolve criminal charges and to pay a criminal penalty of more than  million in connection with schemes involving the bribery of government officials in russia ukraine and mexico in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa assistant attorney general leslie r caldwell of the justice department’s criminal division assistant director stephen richardson of the fbi’s criminal investigative division and assistant special agent in charge william j maddalena of the fbi’s miami field office made the announcement “teva and its subsidiaries paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials in various countries and intentionally failed to implement a system of internal controls that would prevent bribery” said assistant attorney general caldwell  “companies that compete fairly ethically and honestly deserve a level playing field and we will continue to prosecute those who undermine that goal” “no matter where corruption occurs the fbi and our global partners are committed to diligently rooting out the corruption that betrays the public trust and threatens a fair economy for all” said fbi assistant director stephen richardson “as demonstrated by this case the foreign corrupt practices act has a long reach” said william j maddalena assistant special agent in charge fbi miami  “teva’s egregious attempt to enrich themselves failed and they will now pay a tough penalty” according to the companies’ admissions teva executives and teva russia employees paid bribes to a highranking russian government official intending to influence the official to use his authority to increase sales of teva’s multiple sclerosis drug copaxone in annual drug purchase auctions held by the russian ministry of health  the corrupt arrangement occurred at the same time that the russian government was seeking to reduce the amount spent on costly foreign pharmaceutical products such as copaxone  between  and at least  pursuant to an agreement with a repackaging and distribution company owned by the russian government official teva earned more than  million in profits on copaxone sales to the russian government  moreover the russian official earned approximately  million in corrupt profits through inflated profit margins granted to the official’s company       teva also admitted to paying bribes to a senior government official within the ukrainian ministry of health to influence the ukrainian government’s approval of teva drug registrations which were necessary for the company to market and sell its products in the country  between  and  teva engaged the official as the company’s “registration consultant” paid him a monthly fee and provided him with travel and other things of value totaling approximately   in exchange the official used his official position and influence within the ukrainian government to influence the registration in ukraine of teva pharmaceutical products including copaxone and insulins in addition teva admitted that it failed to implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls and failed to enforce the controls it had in place at its mexican subsidiary which allowed bribes to be paid by the subsidiary to doctors employed by the mexican government  teva admitted that its mexican subsidiary had been bribing these doctors to prescribe copaxone since at least   teva executives in israel responsible for the development of the company’s anticorruption compliance program in  had been aware of the bribes paid to government doctors in mexico  nevertheless teva executives approved policies and procedures that they knew were not sufficient to meet the risks posed by teva’s business and were not adequate to prevent or detect payments to foreign officials  teva also admitted that its executives put in place managers to oversee the compliance function who were unable or unwilling to enforce the anticorruption policies that had been put in place teva entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa in connection with a criminal information filed today in the southern district of florida charging the company with one count of conspiracy to violate the antibribery provisions of the fcpa and one count of failing to implement adequate internal controls  pursuant to its agreement with the department teva will pay a total criminal penalty of   teva also agreed to continue to cooperate with the department’s investigation enhance its compliance program implement rigorous internal controls and retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for a term of three years teva russia has signed a plea agreement in which it has agreed to plead guilty to a onecount criminal information also filed today in the southern district of florida charging the company with conspiring to violate the antibribery provisions of the fcpa  the plea agreement is subject to court approval  the case was assigned to us district judge kathleen m williams of the southern district of florida and teva russias initial court appearance has been scheduled for january   in related proceedings the us securities and exchange commission sec filed a cease and desist order against teva whereby the company agreed to pay approximately  million in disgorgement to the sec including prejudgment interest  thus the combined total amount of us criminal and regulatory penalties to be paid by teva is nearly  million the criminal division’s fraud section reached this resolution based on a number of factors including the fact that teva did not timely voluntarily selfdisclose the conduct but did cooperate with the department’s investigation after the sec served it with a subpoena  teva received a  percent discount off the low end of the us sentencing guidelines fine range because of its substantial cooperation and remediation  the company however did not receive full cooperation credit because of issues that resulted in delays to the early stages of the fraud section’s investigation including vastly overbroad assertions of attorneyclient privilege and not producing documents on a timely basis in response to certain fraud section document requests  because many of the company’s compliance enhancements were more recent and therefore have not been tested the dpa imposes an independent compliance monitor for a term of three years  the fbi’s international corruption unit and miami field office investigated the case  fraud section trial attorneys rohan a virginkar and johnalex romano prosecuted the case  the fraud section appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the sec in this matter  the criminal division’s office of international affairs and the mexican attorney general’s office procuradura general de la república or pgr also provided assistance in this matter the fraud section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all fcpa matters  additional information about the justice department’s fcpa enforcement efforts can be found at

june   bayer sued teva for falsely claiming that gianvi tevas generic of yaz was stabilized by betadex as a clathrate the lawsuit stems from bayers us patent  on the binding and preservative agents

inadequate content uniformity which manifest themselves more strongly the smaller the amount of the active ingredient it has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain lowdosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided at least to a large extent if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin

ingredient concentrations in the dosage units occur almost unavoidably inadequate content uniformity which manifest themselves more strongly the smaller the amount of the active ingredient it has now

inadequate content uniformity which manifest themselves more strongly the smaller the amount of the active ingredient it has now been found that the drawbacks that are observed especially in the preparation and storage of dosage forms which contain lowdosed steroidal sex hormones can be avoided at least to a large extent if dosage forms are prepared that contain powdery cyclodextrin

generic faq generic faq go to parent most read central nervous system cns what are generic drugs generic drugs offer a therapeutic alternative to innovative drugs they contain the same active ingredients as the original innovative products and are available in the same strengths and dosage forms as the original ✉ why are generic drugs’ names different from the original drugs names regulators demand that generic drugs be given a different name from the original drugs in order to avoid confusion typically the generic name of a drug is based on the name of its api whereas the names given to original drugs are intended for marketing purposes ✉ are generic drugs safe a generic drug is bioequivalent to the original innovative drug and meets the same quality standards the active ingredient the content the dosage form and the usage of a generic drug are similar to those of an innovative drug generic drugs are essentially the same as the original drug but are offered at a lower price ✉ what does bioequivalence mean bioequivalence demonstrates a similar profile of behavior of two products in the human body in terms of the rate and extent of absorption of the active pharmaceutical ingredient from the gastrointestinal gi tract to the blood stream bioequivalence study is a regulatory requirement and is performed for all generic drugs to ensure their efficiency and the safety ✉ how do you ensure generic drug safety having tried it in only a limited number of patients the generic products active pharmaceutical ingredient api is identical to that of the innovative drug its purity profile is similar and it is found to be bioequivalent therefore its safety and efficacy are also comparable ✉ why are generic drugs cheaper generic companies are not required to perform lengthy and costly toxicological and clinical studies therefore they can offer their products to the public at considerably lower costs ✉ does every drug have a generic equivalent as long as a drug is protected by patents a generic alternative cant be launched sometimes a generic version is approved and available in a specific country or countries while unavailable in others however with the growing emphasis on generics multiple generic versions of an innovative drug are often developed around about the time it becomes off patent nonetheless in some instances even after a patent has expired there is no generic alternative this may happen due to cost considerations in cases of drugs designed for a limited use or requiring complex manufacturing processes ✉ does the generic drug look the same as its original equivalent sometimes the generic version of a drug may have a different color or shape from its innovative original but these changes do not affect the drugs attributes ✉
