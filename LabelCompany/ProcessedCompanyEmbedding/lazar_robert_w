insiders bob lazar  robert scott lazar or bob lazar born january   in coral gables florida united states to albert lazar and phyllis berliner claims to have worked from  until  as a physicist at an area called s sector four located near groom lake nevada next to area  according to lazar s served as a hidden military location for the study and possible reverse engineering of extraterrestrialflying saucers lazar says he saw nine different discs there and provides details on their mode of propulsion his critics have asserted that lazars credibility crumbled after schools he was supposed to have attended had no record of him while others in the scientific community had no memory of ever meeting him biography and claims lazar first jumped on the media map in  in the los alamos monitor the article titled la man joins the jet set  at  miles an hour was about a jet car that lazar had created and worked on for years with help from a nasa researcher the car was built from a jet engine modified and placed on an existing car model it is also important to note that the article noted lazar as a physicist at the los alamos meson physics facility as it is one media article that puts robert on the map as a physicist in november  lazar appeared in a special interview with investigative reporter george knapp on las vegas tv station klas to discuss his purported employment at s in his interview with knapp lazar said he first thought the saucers were secret terrestrial aircraft whose test flights must have been responsible for many ufo reports gradually on closer examination and from having been shown multiple briefing documents lazar came to the conclusion that the discs were actually of extraterrestrial origin in his filmed testimony lazar explains how this impression first hit him after he boarded one craft being studied and examined its interior for the propulsion of the studied vehicles bob lazar claims that the atomic element  served as a nuclear fuel element  nicknamed ununpentium uup reportedly provided an energy source which would produce antigravity effects under proton bombardment along with antimatter for energy production as the intense strong nuclear force field of element s nucleus would be properly amplified the resulting largescale gravitational effect would be a distortion of the surrounding spacetime continuum that would in effect greatly shorten the distance and travel time to a charted destination lazar also claims that he was given introductory briefings describing the historical involvement by extraterrestrial beings with this planet for the past  years the beings originate from the zeta reticuli    star system and are therefore referred to as zeta reticulians popularly called greys lazar says he has degrees from the california institute of technology and massachusetts institute of technology in  the los angeles times looked into his background and found there was no evidence to support his claims stanton friedman was only able to verify that lazar took electronics courses in the late s at pierce junior college the times did discover that in  lazar had pled guilty to felony pandering he installed a computer system for a local brothel declared bankruptcy and listed his occupation as selfemployed photo processor on documents a  times article reported lazar was on probation in clark county nevada on a pandering charge his educational and professional background cannot be verified  a fact he attributes to government deletion of records desert blast lazar and long time friend gene huff run desert blast an annual festival for explodaholics in the nevada desert starting in  but only formally named in  inspired by desert storm the festival features homemade explosives rockets jetpowered vehicles and other pyrotechnics with the intention of emphasizing the fun aspect of physics united nuclear in the year  lazar started united nuclear an amateur scientific supply company formerly operated in sandia park new mexico and recently moved to laingsburg mi united nuclear sells a variety of materials including radioactive ores powerful magnets scientific curiosities like aerogel and a variety of lab chemicals united nuclear claims over  satisfied customers including lawenforcement agencies schools and amateur scientists in  lazar and wife joy white were charged with violating the federal hazardous substances act for shipping restricted chemicals across state lines following a federal investigation started in  the charges stemmed from a  raid on lazars business where chemical sales records were examined the maximum penalty is  days in prison and a  fine lazar claimed that he mistakenly concluded that he could legally sell the chemicals after finding incorrect information on the internet in  lazarunited nuclear were fined  for violating a law against selling chemicals and components used to make illegal fireworks lazar pled guilty to three criminal counts of introducing into interstate commerce and aiding and abetting the introduction into interstate commerce of banned hazardous substanceslazar also entered into a consent decree that permanently limits the amount of future sales of fireworksrelated chemicals and united nuclear scientific equipment and supplies was placed on probation for three years  lazar again gained attention in  from news reports that he sold small amounts of polonium a radioactive element which was in the news because of its role in fatally poisoning former soviet intelligence agent and whistleblower alexander litvinenko fact or fiction although his stories have garnered some rather interesting fanfare and media attention it is hard to determine what the truth really is some hold out for bobs story but the majority of others remain skeptical including stanton friedman who looked into lazars claims and did his own investigating on the matter another debunker is dr david l morgan morgan looked into all of lazars scientific claims and put down most of the ideas that lazar had elaborated on in his description of the alien spacecraft particularly its propulsion systems and use of element  morgan also went on to say after reading an account by bob lazar of the physics� of his area  ufo propulsion system my conclusion is this mr lazar presents a scenario which if it is correct violates a whole handful of currently accepted physical theories that in and of itself does not necessarily mean that his scenario is impossible but the presentation of the scenario by lazar is troubling from a scientific standpoint mr lazar on many occasions demonstrates an obvious lack of understanding of current physical theories source wikipedia bob lazar area  and related  area  runway and main complex credit

testimony robert scott lazar  robert lazar security badge older version of wikipedia robert lazar security badgein november  lazar appeared in a special interview with investigative reporter george knapp on las vegas tv station klas to talk about the several aspects and implications of his work at s bob lazar says he was initially introduced to work at s by dr edward teller he claims his tasks consisted in the scientific investigation of the propulsion system of one of nine discshaped aircraft as a general part of the ongoing reverse engineering project taking place at s lazar claims that he initially thought the saucers were secret terrestrial aircraft whose test flights must have been responsible for many of the ufo reports however lazar stated that gradually on closer examination and from having been shown multiple briefing documents he came to the conclusion that the discs must have been of extraterrestrial origin in his filmed testimony lazar claims that this impression first hit him after he boarded the craft under study and examined their interior for vehicular propulsion lazar claims that an unexpectedly stable element with atomic number  served as nuclear fuel the onboard element  or ununpentium reactor reportedly provided an enormous energy source for the triad of gravityfield generators located in the bottom section of the craft the energy conversion rate of this reactor supposedly allowed a craft at least  years operation on less than a quarterkilogram of element  an additional property of element  also allowed its reactor to produce a very miniscule gravitya wave which was fantastically amplified and channelled through the gravitydistortion devices to provide lift and propulsion for the alleged alien vehicles gravitya is distinguished from gravityb in that gravitya acts only between atomic nuclear components and is vastly more powerful than the gravityb which we all know from our own everyday experience lazar further claimed that he was given introductory briefings describing the historical involvement by extraterrestrial beings with this planet for  years he claimed that the beings originated from the zeta retuculi    star system and are therefore referred to as zeta reticulans and are what many people refer to as the greys   w presented by robert s lazar on his commercial united nuclear website bob lazar writes in the aboutsection bob had previously worked at los alamos national laboratory specifically in the meson physics facility  involved with experiments using the  mile long linear particle accelerator critics have argued that the los alamos nuclear laboratory could not back up this claim the experimental laboratory denied ever having employed lazar investigative reporter george knapp however found bob

the man behind element   saucer motor model bob lazar the man behind element  investigative reporter george knapp updated may    pm  httpwwwklastvcomglobalstoryasps how does this sound  a conversion kit that would allow your car to run on clean plentiful hydrogen its in the works in new mexico and the name of the guy who is building it may ring a bell hes bob lazar and  years ago he told the iteams george knapp about area  and said scientists there were studying ufos he dropped out of sight but george caught up with him as a teenager bob lazar built a jetpowered bicycle then a jet honda then a jet dragster these days hes focused on a different propulsion system bob lazar former government scientist said every vehicle we have here is powered by hydrogen at his new home in rural new mexico lazar has been working on a conversion kit that will turn any car into a hydrogen hybrid his two vehicles have already been converted and can travel up to  miles on hydrogen then switch automatically back to gasoline lazar wants to take it a step further lazar said every major car company is working on a hydrogen system but the only difference is they want to sell you a new hydrogen car and sell you hydrogen gas at hydrogen gas stations basically were making a conversion kit you can use in your own car and instead of buying hydrogen from someone else you make it he makes hydrogen using water and a solar powered generator but again with a lazar twist its the only particle accelerator on the block i guarantee ya the small lab behind his home has a foot long particle accelerator he built from scratch he uses it to produce metal hydrides which absorb hydrogen gas like a sponge and make it much safer to use as a fuel lazar says you can do that with ordinary metal hydrides but we found a way to manipulate the atomic structure to change things its worked fantastically george knapp teases it almost sounds like youre a real scientist lazar replies thats what they tell me its an inside joke based on the ridicule lazar has faced ever since he went public in  with his claims that he worked on flying saucers in the nevada desert the military refused to answer any questions about lazar or his claims nor could we verify much of anything about his life lazar told us he previously worked at los alamos national lab the lab repeatedly denied it even after we found lazars name in the lab phone book his critics say that since he cant prove he ever earned a college degree he cant be a real scientist even if he can build jet engines hydrogen systems and particle accelerators is there a way to prove any part of his story maybe in  lazar claimed the et saucers he worked on could produce their own gravity this propulsion was made possible by a superheavy substance lazar called element  what is the problem with this story element  did not exist in  now however it does scientists at the lawrence livermore lab created a miniscule amount of  last year a profound development but the material decayed almost instantly so where did the government get  pounds of the stuff which is what lazar claimed long ago lazar says it has to come from some place where its natural like from a super nova in other words it comes from a solar system other than ours lazars critics say the fact that  as created in a lab is unstable and fleeting proves lazar is a liar lazar says the first batch was only a starting point and that he will be proven right in the long run id like to see them continue to work and produce different isotopes of  because theyre gonna come up with a handful of different varieties and theyre gonna come up with a stable isotope and thats what were interested he countered by no means does he dwell on being proven right he and his wife have left the ufo crowd far behind and could care less they say lazar stands by his original story but says i cant say i would do it again i would probably keep my mouth shut this time george knapp inquired but you must get a twinge about the program lazar said oh sure i mean who wouldnt like to go back and see what theyre doing now but on the other hand id rather be here earlier this year british scientists say they demonstrated an antigravity system that appears to be based on the theories revealed years ago by lazar some scientists say its proof that what lazar said about element  is true after all  source httpwwwklastvcomglobalstoryasps livermore scientists team with russia to discover elements  and   a calcium ion is accelerated to a high velocity in a cyclotron and directed at

gene huff posted to altconspiracyarea  mar  summary this is a synopsis or maybe booklet of bob lazars story which is being offered as a ground zero for future dialogue this is a synopsis or maybe booklet of bob lazars story which is being offered as a ground zero for future dialogue after coming to the internet a short time ago i noticed that peoples knowledge of bobs story varied widely this is an effort to increase that knowledge base so people who either support or dismiss bobs story do it for the right reasons bobs story is long and complex and in this document ive tried to condense it to a manageable size without omitting relevant points im going to emphasize how things looked from my point of view i wont elaborate on propulsion systems and things of that sort so if you want that you can get it on the lazar tape and hear if from bob himself so here we go in the late s i was working as a real estate appraiser in las vegas and still am for that matter bob lazar known as bob the photo guy to most las vegas appraisers operated the photo lab that serviced many appraisers at that time bob and i had met in  and by  we had become friends and began to socialize together bobs wife tracy usually did the photo deliveries to our office and at first i had talked to her and seen her infinitely more than bob periodically she would talk about when she and bob lived in los alamos not together and i just presumed that he ran a photo lab down there bob and tracy met when tracy was hired to work at a business run buy bobs first wife carol tracys dad don merck worked at the los alamos national lab lanl from here on out and thats how she happened to be living there don worked on the conventional charge that implodes and compresses the nuke material to make an atomic bomb explode after bob and i started socializing i began to notice that he knew a lot about many things i knew that he was somewhat of an egghead because when he would do a rare photo delivery he would drive a honda crx in which he had installed a jet engine but his knowledge base extended far beyond that there was little he didnt know about jet engines combution engines electronics computer hardware and software etc he even made some nitro glycerin one day while we sat talking at the kitchen table we later took it out to the desert and blew it up thats how i knew it was indeed a high energy explosive eventually i asked him why he knew all of this stuff he said ive got degrees in physics and electronic technology i said well whats the difference between you and a scientist he said  i am a scientist i said why didnt you tell me he said what did you want me to do say hey man im a scientist i said yeah i would have he just shook his head and walked away i later found out that he had worked at the meson physics facility at lanl all this time i just thought he was some guy who ran a photo lab and just happened to have an interest in jet engines he also had and still has a rail type dragster with a jet engine from one of the militarys first supersonic fighters anyway in time i met bobs dad al his mother phyllis tracys dad don joe vaninetti an old friend from los alamos joes last job at lanl was melting down plutonium he is currently completing his masters in soils analysis soils science up in utah youll hear more about joe later melissa crey maybe cray joes room mate and a physicist at lanl and jim tagliani and old friend and computer  electronic tech all of these people seemed to think bob was a scentist and to this day i have no reason to doubt him and numerous reasons to believe him jim tagliani actually worked with bob at fairchild electronics in southern cal where bob was the youngest electrical engineer ever to have worked there this was a couple of years prior to bobs los alamos job at this point in  bob was bored with the photo lab and had sent out resumes to various government labs to try and get back into another scientific job included on that list was dr edward teller the father of the hydrogen bomb and scientific consultant to the last  or  presidents bob had met teller in  in los alamos when teller was there lecturing coincidentally at this same time bobs picture was on the front page of the los alamos monitor newspaper a staff writer named terry england had done an article on bob and a honda crx in which he had installed a jet engine this wasnt the same jet crx he had when i first met him this article ran in the june   edition of that paper and in it they refer to bob as and i quote lazar a physicist at the los alamos meson physics facility its difficult to believe that in a town of  scientists who all have egos about their credentials the only local newspaper could refer to bob as a scientist if he was not one at least not without any public outrage anyway when bob arrived early to hear teller speak there teller sat reading the newspaper article about bob bob used this as an avenue to introduce himself and they had a short chat about jets etc bob later heard tellers speech and that was that so in  when bob sent out all of these resumes he thought why not take a shot  joe bob gene john  it had been a while since he sent out these resumes and one day i dropped by his house and asked him if he had heard any news he said as a matter of fact yeah edward teller called me i said whos edward teller after he explained i understood the importance of the call teller had responded by phone and said that he was no longer active but currently worked in a chief consultant capacity however teller did give bob the name of a gentleman to call here in las vegas bob called this guy and talked to him and a short time later someone from egg called bob to set up an interview egg is a company that has all kinds of high tech interests here at the nevada test site bob threw away the piece of paper with the name teller gave him on it remember at this point in time nobody knew what bob was headed for and its obvious that it would be nice to have that name now so bob went to egg for the interview bob later told me that he dazzled them by having every answer to some pretty complex questions and he was optimistic about getting the job this was unusual because bob isnt one to pat himself on the back however dazzling them temporarily backfired because they told him he was overqualified for the job and he didnt get it they then told him not to lose hope because they had something coming up that he might be interested in ultimately they called him back and hired him to work on a propulsion project in an outer area bob reported to the egg building at mccarran airport which had runway access where he was met by dennis mariani mariani was a security man of medium build and heighth about  to  years old blonde hair and a tightly cropped blonde mustache mariani had a military look and manner but he didnt wear a uniform with mariani as his escort bob was flown out to area  at groom lake at area  bob had to sign a secrecy agreeement and an agreement to waive his constitutional rights which is illegal but was made possible by an executive order with ronald reagans signature on it he also had to sign an agreement which allowed them to monitor his phone line bob already had q clearance which is top secret civilian clearance at los alamos but he had never gone through anything like this the clearance he was now attaining would require perpetual monitoring of his activities and would never simply be attained and forgotten about until the next review date after some abrupt suggestions that he honor his secrecy agreement and watch his general conduct he and mariani boarded a bus with blacked out windows and took a  to  minute ride down a bumpy dirtgravel road they arrived at a base near papoose dry lake bed know as s s was a combination of buildings and hangars built into the side of a mountain armed guards were everywhere and security was oppressive bob even got an armed escort when he went to the bathroom they arranged bobs id and gave him a physical which included a test for allergic reactions to substances which were not identified for bob after this he was placed in a briefing room by himself to read some briefings as part of his indoctrination as mariani closed the door to leave bob alone bob saw a poster on the back of the door it was a flying saucer hovering over a dry lake bed and it was captioned theyre here bob opened the top folder on the desk and it contained  x  glossy photos of  different flying saucers including the one on the poster to this day no one knows why bob was selected for this project bob has a comprehensive knowledge base and is an excellent problem solver but this may not be uncommon in the scientific community maybe the good word from edward teller carried a lot of weight its even possible that the nod from teller carried more weight than was originally intended no one knows at this point in time tracy helped with the photo lab during the day and worked out at a health club and took flying lessons at night bob was on call for s and would generally be called to go out once every week or two they said hed be working on an on call basis until he was brought up to speed at which time he would work on a more consistant basis theyd always have bob report in the late afternoon and work evenings which allowed him to maintain the photo lab during the day bob was now very secretive about his job and would only tell his wife and friends that he was working on something that required clearance he eventually did tell us that he flew into area  when he went to work we had no idea what he was actually doing and because of that none of us were overly curious as to what his project was around this same time klas the cbs affiliate is las vegas had been running local news shows featuring ufo researchers which i found entertaining and intriguing these shows were hosted by george knapp a local news anchor who is now high profile and arguably the most informative and motivating speaker on the ufo circuit george doesnt speak as regularly as ufo experts but is infinitely more informed than them especially with things ufological in nevada on these shows much ado was being made about alleged ufos and aliens at area  bob assured us that there were no ufos at area  as it ended up he was telling the truth they were at s and they were called discs and they were anything but unidentified bob had been hired to be part of a back engineering team back engineering is the act of taking apart a finished product to find out what makes it tick in this instance their job was to back engineer a flying disc to see if it could be reproduced with earth materials bobs specific job was to help back engineer the propulsion system in subsequent trips to s bob was exposed to the propulsion system on a bench in a lab as well as the propulsion system in place in a disc in a sleek disc he would eventually nickname the sport model bob had to hang upside down through an opening on the floor of the central level to view the gravity amplifiers on the lower level he eventually witnessed a brief low altitude test flight of this same disc he was also taught how the discs are able to distort spacetime to achieve interstellar travel the sport model disc is currently being produced as a plastic model by the testor corporation in subsequent visits to the briefing room he read read overview reports which were used to give the diverse group of s scientists some idea of the breadth of the project naturally they were all given in depth information regarding their own particular endeavors but it seems that they couldnt put good scientific minds to work and compartmentalize information so much that someone wouldnt say  by the way arent these flying saucers were working on the scientists at s worked in teams and were obviously not allowed to chat in the lunch room about what everybody else was doing so apparently they gave them all a limited overview to satisfy their curiousity and keep them sane in these reports bob read information about mans history and philosophy and theology and the part that these aliens who brought the disc technology played in these areas much of this information was alarming even shocking and it has certainly changed my life this information combined with the defense capabilities and possibilities of disc technology and gravity propulsion  has caused this to be the most secret program in history and the pet project which the military and political elite have kept from the rest of the dod and for that matter the rest of mankind  during this time agents from the office of federal investigation the ofi would randomly visit bobs house the ofi agents are the guys who do background checks on people hired for classified positions on the nevada test site and elsewhere i would imagine one time an agent named mike thigpen visited with other agents and searched bobs house and belongings thigpen was witnessed there by kristen merck bobs now exsisterinlaw and mrs wayne higdon the wife of a mutual friend of bobs and mine george knapp later asked thigpen what he was doing at bobs house thigpen claimed he had no file on it and he couldnt remember being there he said maybe he was there asking bob questions about jim tagliani a friend of ours who was then trying to get clearance to work as an electronics technician at the stealth fighter base on the tonopah test range this was a ridiculous response thousands of people nationwide have been visited by investigators from the ofi or dod to respond to questions about friends and neighbors and relatives who are in the process of getting cleared for classified positions these agents hardly retain the right to search your house and personal belongings obviously thigpen was doing his job by not remembering being at bobs house even though he was witnessed there by two women who didnt even really know each other in defense of the ofi investigators the guys doing the background checks are not necessarily informed of the destination of the subject of their investigation even if thigpen had admitted his activities at bobs house this would have been no sort of verification that he knew what bob was in for the depth of the requisite investigation may indicate the level of security clearance but not the actuality of the subjects employment around this same time the us scientists at s had made some sort of discovery which was a major step forward in understanding disc technology and gravity propulsion we had apparently involved some russian scientists to whatever degree and rather than share this advance with them we kicked them out bob doesnt know that the russians were allowed to actually work with the hardware they may have only been involved in the mathematical and physical theory he doesnt know anyway the russians werent pleased about being left out one of the s scientists didnt show up for work for a couple of days and security was paranoid they said that the kgb had a presence in las vegas and they were afraid that they would either abduct someone that worked at s or make the bribe so good that someone wouldnt be able to refuse the s guy eventually turned up but security wanted to be safe rather than sorry they decided to make everyone in the program who flew out from egg carry guns from home to egg and from egg back home at egg a female official distributed a small caliber pistol to bob and told him that if he lost it hed have to pay them  for it bob said no way because he knew this pistol wasnt even worth  after some discussion bob made them aware that he had a  magnum amongst other guns and they agreed that he would carry his own gun however since all of bobs guns were purchased in new mexico and had never been registered they wanted bob to register his guns so everything was legal dennis mariani escorted bob down to the las vegas metro substation on the southwest corner of atlantic and st louis bob sat in a waiting area and mariani went in and spoke about whatever with the police official in charge a short time later the police official came out of the office with mariani to make a copy of something he looked at bob and scoffed so this is the kid the russians might be after i guess bob wasnt the big strong heman required to command this guys respect its curious that mariani would have even mentioned anything like that to a local cop in nevada you can carry a gun in your car as long as its not concealed your car is interpreted as an extension of your home so bob didnt need a permit to carry a concealed weapon or anything like that this event has subsequently caused us to question whether or not dennis mariani was from nevada also around this same time something was going on that bob didnt know about the feds monitoring his phone line had heard tracy talking with her flight instructor who was teaching her more than just how to fly she was having an affair and they knew that if bob inadvertantly found out or if tracy confessed bob could potentially become emotionally unstable they kept him involved at s on a limited basis but the time intervals between calls to work lengthened and he became frustrated this was ultimately a blessing for jim tagliani and me bob sensed that something was wrong they had give him a taste of honey and he had a strong desire to get back out to s he would hear us talking about george knapps ufo shows and we would wonder aloud about the actuality of the situation in a rebellious move bob threw us some hints and finally decided that he would do us the favor of allowing us to know not suspect that something was really happening after not being called to work for some time he broke down and told me i understand that he told jim tagliani around the same time we didnt have group meetings or anything like that jim didnt know what i knew and i didnt know what jim knew bob was the central cog in that relationship and though i consider jim tagliani a friend we seldom socialize together unless bob is involved when bob told me we were riding down alta drive in my car he said that he was working at s on flying discs and he was back engineering the propulsion system i was intrigued to say the least he said one of the discs looked like it had been stood up on its edge to have a projectile fired through it to test the integrity of the metal or something along those lines the conversation was brief but i remember it like it was yesterday i now had a million questions to ask bob but we couldnt talk on the telephone and considering the state of the art in listening devices we couldnt talk at his house either this confirmation increased my appetite for reading ufo literature exponentially i soon saw that no one knew what bob knew and i was lucky enough to have him telling me when we felt it was safe and convenient we would have discussions and he would tell me things about s and i would tell him things that i had read we both found it hilarious that organizations like mufon andcufon named themselves by placing ufon after their initials so we jokingly nicknamed each other bufon and gufon for bobs ufo network and genes ufo network respectively these were nicknames that later government agents would not find so funny around this same time bob received his first paycheck for one weeks pay even though the days had never been worked consecutively the check was for  bob showed me the check and i remember commenting that i thought that a senior staff physicist which was bobs position would have been paid more than that he proceeded to tell me how underpaid scientists were and i later found out that was true i think i was the only one other than bob to ever see that check he had his eye on some electronic equipment so he decided to buy it and not tell tracy that the check had ever arrived in later years when people questioned bobs w i knew it was actual because even though i didnt remember the exact amount i knew that it was nine hundred and fifty or sixty bucks which showed me that bobs w reflected the money actually received later when he left the program the government still owed him for some time worked a bill which remains unpaid to this day the next time he was called to work the people at s were questioning bob about his friend joe vaninetti they implied they might be interested in joe and wanted bob to get a resume from joe and take it to the office at egg on the day when bob told them hed have it there he was busy and couldnt make it since joe was still down in los alamos bob asked me to drop it off for him i took joes resume out to egg and the receptionist asked me what i was doing there i told her that i had joes resume and she grabbed it from me as though she was expecting it we still dont know if they were interested in joe or they just wanted to know more about him because he was bobs main but not only los alamos connection they may have heard bob talking on the phone with joe or something like that no one knows the bottom line is they never hired joe and his name was never brought up again on one of bobs last nights at s he was being escorted down a hallway by armed guards and was told to keep his eyes forward as they passed a door with one of those small square windows in it out of the corner of his eye bob thought he saw a small grey alien standing between two men in lab coats all three were facing a console of some sort and had their backs to the door when he tried to turn his head to actually look and confirm his sighting he was pushed forward by a guard behind him and told again to keep his eyes forward bob recognized it as a grey alien because these types of beings were shown in reports in the briefing room to this point he had surmised that any grey aliens had been gone since  at least thats what the briefing reports implied the sight in that room surprised him to say the least after work that night bob arrived home and tracy was gone apparently to her flying lesson he needed someone to talk to so he called me i had been sick with the flu all that day and my wife had been nursing me back to health all that evening i let the answering machine go off and after it beeped i heard bob say gufon its bufon pick up the phone i answered and he suggested that we get together that night i explained to him that i had been sick and after all of my wifes efforts she would be mad if i left he insisted and said that he wanted to talk to me about those baby pictures he and i had no business with baby pictures so i recognized this as code and he mentioned photos so if anyone was listening they wouldnt be suspicious i reminded him that i rise early and suggested we get together the next morning i asked if he would be up at that early hour he replied that he would probably be up all night i told him id talk to my wife and call him right back i told my wife that something big must have been up because he was so persistent after all we already knew he was working on flying saucers so this had to be something big whatever it was he wanted to talk about was so important that he risked sounding suspicious to those monitoring his phone i called bob back to tell him id come over and oddly there was no answer i thought maybe he had stepped out to get something to eat id wait about  minutes between calls but he didnt answer the next four times i called him finally on the sixth call he picked up the phone and said ill have to call you back some people from work are here bob didnt call back that night but since i had the flu i fell asleep anyway as it ended up right after i had hung up with him the first time government agents arrived at his door and wanted to know who this gufon character was to them this sounded like a code name not a joke bob explained and they stayed there and filled out a multipage report on gene huff aka gufon we dont know if these were the guys who were actually listening to our conversation or if they had been radioed or telephoned about it however they found out they couldnt have been far from bobs house to arrive that quickly the next morning i arrived at my office around seven i had taken some baby pictures to the office with me just in case bob walked into my office around seven thirty and motioned with his hands in an effort to tell me to watch what i said he now knew they were suspicious of me and he didnt want to talk in my office or on my phone it was highly unusual for bob to ever be at my office before ten thirty or so and his face was very ruddy he looked like he just may have been up all night i said here are those baby pictures as i handed them to him and he said thanks since we couldnt talk i grabbed a legal pad and wrote down two questions the first one said have you only flown in planes as i was thinking he might have flown in a disc the second one said has everyone youve seen been from earth for obvious reasons he grabbed the pen and answered the questions yes and no respectively he said ill take care of these baby pictures and left my office just to be safe i went out to the wetbar sink at my office and burned that piece of paper bob later told me the rest of the story which ive just told you now in present day when bob is asked about this event by strangers he explains it away by saying that it may just have been an alien doll or something along those lines which was employed just to test him he tends to diminish this story with time but as you can tell thats not what he thought back on that night another substantial period of time had passed since bob had been called to work and one day i dropped by his house he answered the door and we walked out to the sidewalk in front of his house to have a short chat i was telling him about all of the ufo stuff i had read recently and the whole time he was looking up in the sky preoccupied with his own thoughts i was essentially whining that everything of substance in ufology always happened a long time ago ie the roswell crash in the s the russian sightings in the s i told him that if all this was reality there should be something happening somewhere now and thats where i wanted to be he stopped looking at the sky and looked at me and said what are you doing wednesday night bob had had it he was tired of them not involving him to a greater degree and he decided to rebel in an aggressive manor he had decided to take me to the desert out off of the now infamous highway  to witness a disc flight test bob knew the tests were held on wednesday evenings right after dusk the first wednesday march   we arrived right at dusk turned our lights off and went in about  miles on the groom lake road soon we saw a bright light rise above the mountains which were between us and s the light begin jumping and dancing around doing step moves in the sky then would come to a dead stop and hover etc it repeated this type of activity for a few minutes which was thrilling but it was so far away we could only see so much this activity by the object was blatant and it wasnt our eyes playing tricks on us with starlight and planet light being distorted by the atmosphere or clouds or anything of that sort eventually the light slowly sat back down behind the mountains little did we know that the next wednesday march   would present us with the thrill of a lifetime i would not generally remember these wednesday dates but my son was born wednesday march   so the wednesday dates were easy to remember the next wednesday bob tracy jim tagliani and i rented a lincoln towncar to make the trip a little more comfortable we all owned compact cars and the round trip out to groom lake was a killer we arrived turned our lights off and went in about  miles on the groom lake road we pulled off on a side road and unloaded our video camera telescope binoculars etc out of the trunk and we left the trunk lid open the disc came up around the same place but this time it staged a breathtaking performance it repeated moves similar to the week before but this time it came down the mountain range toward us at first it seemed far away then youd blink and it would seem a lot closer then youd blink again and it would seem a lot closer it wasnt the same sensation as seeing a set of headlights on a car or landing lights on a jet approach you at night time there was no sense of continual movement toward you it just sort of jumps toward you and this is very alarming to your brain bob explained that this is because of its method of propulsion and the way it distorts spacetime and light bob also explained that the bright glow of the disc was due to the way it was energized when the disc came our direction it glowed so brightly that we thought it might explode so we moved behind the open trunk lid for protection the fact is that an explosion was the only thing other than the sun that we had ever seen be that bright so thats why we suspected an explosion as we all look back on that now its difficult to believe it came so close that we backed away from it after all it was probably still a few miles away and that fact reflects how brightly it was glowing but the fact is it did come that close and the event was much more thrilling than ive described here it too eventually sat down behind the mountains and we left we have never seen anything comparable to this in the sky out in central nevada since then and we havent even heard other peoples descriptions come close to describing what we saw remember this all happened prior to the highway  sky watch becoming ufologys favorite past time the next wednesday april   we arrived shortly before dusk on the drive out bob told us he had been called to go into work the next day numerous security vehicles were sweeping the roads that the cattle ranchers use to roundup their cattle after open range grazing it seemed that this night more than the previous wednesday nights they wanted to make sure no one was outside of area  we tried to sneak in using our usual stealth mode but security saw our brake lights and began to chase us we tried to beat them out to the highway but they came from all directions and ultimately we had to stop we told them we were simply out there star gazing which they didnt believe for one moment they agreed that they couldnt chase us off of public land but simply said they would prefer that we retreat back up to the highway they issued us a copy of a written warning that said we were approaching a military installation and it stated the nevada revised statutes which cited the penalties for taking pictures of the base etc so much for those ufo researchers who say that the government wont admit that area  exists if that warning isnt an admission i dont know what is we went back up to the highway but we didnt leave a short time later a lincoln county cop named lamoreaux pulled us over and hassled us he took our ids and radioed our identities into the security base station it was obvious that the guards and the sherriffs office worked together he let us go and we went back home the next day when bob reported to egg dennis mariani stopped him and told him they wouldnt be flying out to groom instead they took bobs car and drove out to indian springs air force base a small rural base about an hour north of las vegas on the drive out mariani sarcastically told bob that when they told bob this was top secret they presumed he understood that meant not to bring his family or friends out to watch a disc test he also told bob that our shenanigans outside of area  had caused them to postpone a high performance disc test mariani was totally silent for most of the rest of the drive at indian springs bob was debriefed and reprimanded for bringing us out to watch the disc test they didnt know we had been successful the two previous wednesdays they helicoptored the head security man in from area  to identify bob as one of the people he saw when they stopped us the night before they told him that if they caught any of the rest of us out there again theyd arrest us for espionage bob explained that he couldnt tell us what to do and also reminded them that we were on public land they explained that they would simply claim that we were on government land and that a judge would certainly believe twenty of them before hed believe us they blatantly stated that they would collectively lie to get us convicted not that we were surprised by that that was certainly enough to keep me away from there at least for a while they also showed bob transcripts of tracys phone conversations with her boyfriendflight instructor bob already knew about the affair but he was shocked to see that they had actual typed transcripts of her conversations since they now knew that he was aware of the affair they considered him to be a sure candidate for emotional instability they revoked his security clearance and said he could reapply in  to  months they let him go back home that night but they apparently werent done with him yet a short time later they called and demanded his presence back out on the nevada test site but bob refused he knew they had no intention of letting him go this time and he was not about to volunteer to help them out dennis mariani called and threatened him but bob stood firm after losing his wife and the most important job a scientist could ever have bob was pretty much a broken man his concern for their efforts at retaliation caused him to decide to go on television in silhouette and tell the story of what was going on out in central nevada after he did that they shot his back tire out one evening as he was driving up an entrance ramp to get on the highway this was an extra hint at what was in store for him if he didnt shut up bob had decided to work with george knapp to expose the story this was an aggressive move on his part to try and gain some leverage if he went high profile he could force them to adopt a hands off policy after going high profile if they incarcerated him or killed him they would have confirmed that what he was saying was true and that was definitely not their desire at this point we all agreed that there was great power in knowing that someone was listening on the phone people watch what they say when they suspect their phone line is tapped but its a much different story when youre confident theyre listening we called friends in other states and told them bobs story we would also imply that we had informed numerous friends and agencies by mail something that they could not monitor if someone actually was listening and i think they were we must have driven them crazy trying to figure out what was real they had to prepare for the worst and presume we might be telling the truth bob was being followed by unmarked cars both day and night i was even followed one evening finally dennis mariani contacted bob and send he wanted to meet and speak with bob on a personal level bob set up the meeting at the union plaza casino in downtown las vegas the meeting was set for  pm on saturday night when theres be plenty of witnesses if anything bad happened joe vaninetti happened to be in town from los alamos that weekend we created a stealth plan and joe and i accompanied bob down to the union plaza hotel bob entered first and a short time later joe and i entered and sat down to play the slot machines as though we were tourists bob walked around and looked for mariani but at first he couldnt find him bob even paged him on the house phone finally bob saw mariani approaching in a crowd of people and walked up to him mariani wouldnt make eye contact with bob and walked on by as if bob wasnt there bob also noticed another security man from s over by the wall on the other side of the crowd bob casually walked by joe and i and told us what happened without looking at us or appearing to socialize with us from a distance he then saw mariani walk into another part of the casino bob asked me to go into that other part of the casino with him but to stay out of sight he wanted someone else to be able to visually identify dennis mariani we entered in a crowd and bob pointed out mariani who was now sitting at a blackjack table i went and hid behind a bank of slot machines behind mariani i was only about  feet from him and i had a clear view of him he looked exactly as bob had described him thirty five to forty years old medium build blonde hair  and a tightly cropped blonde mustache and this night he was also smoking a slender cigar marianis manor was quite curious he was sitting between two very attractive very buxom women at the blackjack table yet he would only look down at his cards and didnt seem to be enjoying himself this is unusual behavior for someone in the festive casino atmosphere of a saturday night in las vegas bob walked down the other side of the blackjack pit parallel to a long bar mariani looked up and his head followed bob as bob made that walk since this was the only time he looked up from his cards especially considering the other available scenery this indicated to me that he indeed knew who bob was bob walked around the blackjack pit and walked right up to mariani and said well dennis you said you wanted to meet and here i am now whats the deal not only did mariani not answer he didnt even look at bob or acknowledge his existence bob said dennis what the hell is going on what is this shit again mariani didnt acknowledge him bob came over to me behind the slot machines and we quickly formulated a plan to follow him and try and get his license number or something along those lines mariani was only out of our sight for less than  seconds but when we looked back he was gone we hurried through the casino in different directions looking for him we even checked the restrooms but he was nowhere to be found we went back to the other part of the casino where joe was sitting and asked him if anybody fitting marianis descripton had come that way joe said no one who looked like that had walked by his area we could only surmise that maybe mariani was there to speak on a personal level and that the other security guy that bob had spotted was a surprise to everyone including dennis no one has seen or heard anything from dennis mariani since that night after this bob proceeded to cooperate with george knapp who subsequently produced ufos the best evidence george won the upi individual achievement award for that special during the making of that documentary george tried to check out bobs credentials including his schooling and his previous employment george could only find a record of bobs schooling at pierce junior college in california even los alamos denied that bob ever worked there bob provided george with evidence that he had worked at los alamos this included the names of people he worked with newpaper articles about him and even a lanl phone book that listed bobs name in it people were apparently going to great lengths to detach from bob lazar eventually bob cooperated with george in contacting kirkmayer the lanl subcontractor that bob worked for at lanl both kirkmayer and lanl admitted that bob had been issued a z number of  on may   but both said they no longer had any record of bobs employment by the way a z number is some prerequisite identification number for anyone who works at any of the lanl facilities bob also provided george with his w from s however george ran into dead ends when he tried to find who deposited money in irs and fica accounts on behalf of bob lazar the word was that some irs and social security files are also classified pandering charge in the months that followed ufology began to become more mainstream and much of it was due to george knapp and others exposing bob lazars story the rachel bar and grill outside of area  became the little a le inn and people began running bus tours out to watch the sky over groom lake george knapp received  to  phone calls on a daily basis which involved peoples reports and questions reagarding all aspects of ufology journalists from all over the world were chasing bob lazar for interviews and still are for that matter then came the brothel bust bob was still a broken man but when he had recovered enough to go out in public he sought some comfort with a hooker now i dont know how this looks and sounds elsewhere in the world but in nevada this is no big deal prostitution is legal in the state of nevada but illegal in the counties that house las vegas reno and lake tahoe however this is just for show and its common knowlege that brothels and hookers in the form of escort services exist in these cities also the police pretend to passively pursue this but along with gambling drinking and entertainment prostitution is part of the package bob called a number out of the newpaper and happened upon a  to  year old madamhooker who ran  to  girls out of a condominium project in the southeast part of town this was an upper line condo project so dont envision some dark sleezy place engulfed in red lights bob went there and did his business but before he left the hookers were having some problems with a stereo or something like that and naturally bob came to the rescue he fixed it for them and they invited him back for a freebie well bob went back more than once and in time all of the girls loved him bob has this unique manor about him in which he treats everyone equally when you interact with bob he never gives you the feeling that hes a scientist and youre not so youre not worthy he treated the hookers with respect like friends and equals and this was a breath of fresh air to them considering the attitudes they get from some people the madam explained to bob that she had an ongoing affair with a member of las vegas metro vice and that as long as she didnt do outcalls to the hotels vice would turn their heads and allow her to operate it is unknown whose interest these cops were protecting in the hotels the madam also told bob that she was an fbi dea and las vegas metro informant bob felt a sense of security because of all of this and proceeded to tell the madam how he could streamline her operation by installing computers security cameras and other electronic equipment this appealed to her and she financed her brothels entrance into the computer age during all of this something bad happened the madam fell in love with bob she offered him fifty percent of the business to stay around but once the electronics were installed he was no longer interested since he wasnt really interested in her it was a drag for him to be around and he detached himself from her and the brothel to say that she didnt take this very well is an understatement so now television sweeps rolled around and george knapp thought it would be a great idea to give his audience an update on what the now famous bob lazar had been up to since his exit from the program at s klas had set ratings records with georges previous ufo special about bob lazar and they were interested in doing that again when george did the interview bob said amongst other things that he had installed a computer system for a local brothel that was a bad idea the fact that bob had broadcast this on television reflected his naivety about the ramifications of his actions the las vegas cops now had a problem here was a guy stating that he knew where a local brothel was and all they had to do was ask him its whereabouts and then bust it the problem was compounded by the fact that the brothel was run by one of their informants and they were aware of her operation the madams vice buddies explained to her that they had to bust her operation because of bobs televised admission after all the entire vice department didnt know about this just a couple of vice cops she knew and did business with they busted the place and she blamed the entire operation on bob probably under their advice she had a client list of some very high level las vegans including cops and they werent about to force her to make that public they let her off with a misdemeanor called keeping a disorderly house which is nevada statute from the early s i dont think anybody even knows what thats supposed to mean they then charge bob with six felonies these cops thought they could just hang this whole thing on bob and be done with it they soon found out that bob lazar had a large following and hundreds of thousands of people were scrutinizing this story naturally most following bobs story thought this was a setup by the federal government to discredit him and they may have been involved but that is unknown to this day anyway under some of the most incompetent and questionable legal advice in history bob plead guilty to pandering and they dropped the rest of the charges we all urged bob to fight it but he didnt want to spend the money this is part of his i can do everything myself attitude because his dad is a wealthy la businessman and money would have been no problem bob simply wont depend on anyone even those that love him and want to help him prior to sentencing judge john lehman questioned how it was possible that a guy with no previous criminal record like bob would have plead guilty under these circumstances he also couldnt understand how the madam of the brothel wasnt in front of him as a codefendant after all in the madams original statement to the police she admitted having become a prostitute in  when bob lazar was  years old the judge wasnt buying that bob coerced her into anything all of the judges questions and apprehensions were stated on the record on camera and george knapp still has a copy of the raw footage bob was sentenced to  years probation and community service ironically he completed his community service by installing yet another computer system this time for clark county nevada the guys down at probation would jockey for position to see who got to go visit bob so they could talk to him and ask him ufo questions hes now off probation and were currently investigating the possibilities for a pardon the whole thing was one bad dream and somewhat of a joke because there have only been a handful of pandering convictions in the history of las vegas and the others werent scientists with no criminal record even after the brothel fiasco bob was still a highly sought after interview in  i had an operation on my left leg which laid me up for ten weeks since bob kept turning down people who wanted interviews i suggested we make a video tape he said who would want to see a video tape about all of that stuff i proceeded to question bob at length about things and i proceeded to write the script of the lazar tape unless our distributors are lying to us it has become the most highly purchased and bootlegged video in the history of ufo videos the original was produced with elementary facilities and it is currently being remade broadcast quality with state of the art graphics and imaging the rest of the story is pretty much history the story ive just presented you is in no way the totality of what happened but it does present the basic facts im fully aware of everything else that happened so i can answer questions on subjects and details that have not been mentioned here no one knows everything so if i dont know the answer ill simply say i dont know in this synopsis ive also given researchers pseudo researchers and wanna be researchers new tidbits to chase down and verify and to them i say go for it as you have just read bob went public to save his own butt not to do a favor for everyone else this is not to say that there isnt a part of him that thinks we all have the right to know his motive for going public should help explain to some why he is reluctant to participate in some of the the current sideshows that was never his intent id also like to include the personal observation that people who think bob would perpetrate a fraud are wrong he is totally self sufficient and doesnt care enough about what other people think to waste the time to try and fool them if i had to describe bob lazar in one word id call him productive bob doesnt watch television unless its the news or weather channel he doesnt waste one moment of his life preoccuping himself with irrelevant minutia like the rest of us bob couldnt tell you who was in the super bowl or the world series and if the baseball strike never ends it wont affect his life one bit hes busy with one scientific project or another and he certainly isnt sitting around wondering what were saying about him on the internet i know that this synopsis in itself doesnt prove a thing im now going to write a counterpoint to the infamous lazar timeline and post that i dont intend to refute everything thats in it i just intend to put it in perspective this story isnt as simple as some guy with no credentials makes some flying saucer claims and then gets busted for pandering i fully understand everyones apprehensions about the lack of evidence of bob lazars schooling if i didnt know him i would be apprehensive too i wish i had been around when bob went to school but i wasnt anyone who has met bob lazar knows that you dont know what he knows by taking  electronics course at pierce junior college in california when george knapp couldnt find any records on bob i asked bob about it privately i told him that if he did overstate his credentials that he should tell me and i would try and help him smooth it over i certainly believed he worked at los alamos and s even if he had overstated his credentials i believed and still believe his story is way too important to lose its impact because of something like this bob stood firm and didnt change his story ive seen him do this about other subjects and i havent caught him in a lie yet evidence is abundant that he worked at los alamos in the early s if you worked at los alamos you had to have a degree or be working toward one at the university of new mexico at los alamos thats why there is a branch of the university of new mexico in los alamos thats probably still the rule i dont know since bob was never enrolled there obviously lanl believed bob had credentials after youve read the preceding information and after weve had some questions and answers and dialogue on internet i think youll have enough information to put bobs story in perspective im aware of all of the different theories about him which range from total fraud to a subject of mind control to who knows what most of those are based on misinformation by incompetent ufo researchers and blatant liars you dont need ufo researchers and other assorted characters to pass judgment for you even when it comes to the physics of gravity propulsion and disc technology there are numerous books available which are written to the intelligent layman and they explain how physicists know what they know and why they dont know what they dont know if this subject is important to you then do some reading and upload your own knowledge base im comfortable with whatever conclusions you draw both for and against bob lazar i understand the bottom line is that the only opinion that really counts for you is yours all of our current opinions are based on the best information we have at this point in time and all of our opinions are subject to change based on new information thats true of bob lazars story science and life in general up to this point ive responded to all of you by email but now im going to do it on usenet so any benefit of dialogue will be available to all ill treat you as fairly and respectfully as you treat me einstein was quoted as saying common sense is all the prejudices you acquire by the age of  so use your common sense when you examine bobs story but remember to expand your knowledge base at the same time bob lazar is  certain the s story is true im  sure saving  for the fact that i wasnt there myself i hope my effort here will move your opinion up or down so at least it will have been worth the time one way or another please forgive any typos spelling or sentence and paragraph structure as i am not a professional writer and i havent found spell check yet on my new word processsing program keep in touch  source httpwwwufoevidenceorgdocumentsdochtm maximum distortion  as the intensity of the gravitational field around the disc increases the distortion of spacetime around the disc also increases if you could see the spacetime distortion which we cant this is how it would look       as the gravitational field from the amplifiers becomes more intense the form of the spacetime around the disc not only bends upward but at maximum distortion actually folds over into almost a heart shape around the top of the disc     this spacetime distortion is taking place  degrees around the disc creating a volume of distortion so if you were looking at the disc from the top the spacetime distortion would be in the shape of a donut as it enclosed the disc     when the gravitational field around the disc is so intense that the spacetime around the disc achieves maximum distortion the disc cant be seen from any vantage point and for all practical purposes is invisible  all you would se would be the sky around it     at various angles prior to the disc achieving maximum distortion the disc could be visible from one vantage point and not another  all you could see would be the environment around it this is similar to being able to see stars that are behind the sun due to the intense gravity of the sun bending the light path between the star and earth     essentially this creates a sort of spacetime bubble around the craft maximum distortion is not necessary for standard flight over the surface of a planet except in the case of rapid streaks across the sky maximum distortion is essential for this mode of travel the typical fire light comet in the night sky is not the craft but rather the air around the craft ionizing and trailing it source bob lazar maximum
