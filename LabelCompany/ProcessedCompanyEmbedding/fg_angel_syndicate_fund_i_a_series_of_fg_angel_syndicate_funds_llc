syndicate funding on angellist – a company’s perspective  hi im seth levine a boulder co based technology investor and managing director at foundry group while i love technology i’m also a husband father avid cyclist snowboarder and outdoors guy press enter to search archive about legal back to top may   syndicate funding on angellist – a company’s perspective a few months ago angellist announced syndicates – enabling investors on angellist to create fundlike groups of investors to invest together in angellist companies following a single lead investor it’s a great idea and at foundry we quickly decided it would be an interesting experiment to form our own syndicate we were the first formal venture fund to do this since then we’ve completed about  deals i say “about” because we have a few things in various stages of completion as i write this – the intent of fg angels is to make  angellist investments – about  per week we often get asked how the process works and while what’s below has specifics about working with fg angels it also contains some great advice for anyone raising money on angellist in general and through syndicates specifically i’ve edited the text and added some things of my own but this is largely the work of carrie requist ceo of ugrokit a company we recently funded through fg angels how angellist syndicates and fg angels works it’s important to understand that angellist syndicates work somewhat like an opportunity fund where angellist investors sign up to “follow” a syndicate and pledge to invest a certain amount of money the key here is that this isn’t a hard commitment – each syndicate member makes a deal by deal decision to invest as a result the syndicate size isn’t the total amount of money you’ll raise – it’s the maximum you’ll raise from the syndicate and depending on how many members there are to the syndicate and what crowdfunding exemption you use more on that below the actual limit will likely be quite a bit less than the total you see next to the syndicate name on angellist and of course it will also require some work on your part to pull syndicate members into your actual deal syndicates aren’t automatic capita – you’ll still need to work for your money there are  parts to the fg angels or any angellist syndicate investment foundry group or your syndicate leader invests their portion – in fg angels case this is  in parallel they open the investment to their syndicate members on angellist angellist shows for each syndicate the amount that the syndicate leader will invest and the amount pledged by all the syndicate members as a whole shown as “backed by” on angellist at the time of fg angels investment in u grok it their syndicate total was 6k that total excludes the fg angels portion it’s worth reiterating that unlike a mutual fund the investors are not committed to investing in every company that any syndicate backs so the 6k from the members of fg angels represents the maximum investment if every member decided to contribute and again as a practical matter given the number of members in the syndicate and the exemptions that angellist relies upon to fund these syndicates the actual maximum is below this number members have not given any money to angellist or fg angels for the syndicate and ultimately the investor must make their own decision on each deal and then transfer money on a deal by deal basis  many things can effect your actual deal participation including how many deals the syndicate has completed the pace of the syndicate’s investments the type of investment ie note or equity the stage of the company how much the company is raising specific deal terms and members personal preferences u grok it was actively raising on a convertible note and had already closed a portion of it so we already had terms in place foundry reviewed these terms before committing to invest and both fg angel’s k and the syndicate member’s total amount are under the terms of this note this means we did not negotiate deal terms with foundry or with angellist the investors accepted the terms we already had for the convertible note or choose not to invest there are syndicate deals where the lead investor does negotiate terms foundry does this on other fg angel deals but syndicate members don’t – they either accept the terms or don’t participate and they do look at terms so structuring a fair deal is important syndicate dynamics to sign up for fg angels an investor must be approved by foundry group and agree to their terms which include a carry the carry is a percentage of the returns on the investment that the investor will give to foundry group for managing the syndicate and investments note that angellist itself takes a carry as well the carry is between foundry group and the investor and has no direct impact on the angellist company this is beneficial to the startup because neither angellist nor foundry group take any of the investment funds there is no “finders fee” or other fee to the startup for being part of the syndicate fg angels and angellist will get their carry straight from the syndicate investors upon an exit the terms for being a syndicate member and the specific carry vary between syndicates but the key for founders here is that this is all taken care of outside of any specific investment and any investor listed as part of the syndicate will have already agreed to the terms and carry the angellist syndicate shows the number of members in fg angels and lists each syndicate member as well as the amount they have pledged per investment there is a portion of syndicate members who rarely invest in any deals and some who invest in every deal a smaller group performs due diligence on each deal before they invest and makes a deal by deal decision whether or not to participate the timing fg angels syndicate investments go fast foundry committed to invest through fg angels on a friday over the weekend we revised our note and updated our angellist profile on monday our deal went live and almost all the funds raised from the fg angles syndicate were in process by the following monday within one week be ready for the syndicate investment to go live on al fg angels is a popular and fast moving syndicate with 9 members at the time of the u grok it investment – with an explicit goal to launch a new investment each week this means that the interest in your startup will shoot up as soon as the fg angels investment goes live on angellist here is a graph of the investor views on u grok it’s angellist profile over the two weeks that the fg angels syndicate investment was live the first short bar is the monday it went live we launched towards the end of the day the big spike is tuesday what this means for an angellist company is – be completely ready for investors before giving fg angels the green light to go live 6b vs 6c these refer to two of the sec rules that regulate “crowdfunding” financing 6c is the new jobs act provision that in part allows for what’s called a general solicitation on angellist this is shown as a “public” fundraising fg angels syndicate investments are not general solicitations and some syndicate members do not want to invest in companies that are using this exemption check with your lawyer to make sure you have not engaged in general solicitation and make sure you do not click on the angellist button that says “activate” under “raise online on your own” this can’t be undone so make sure you’re careful about this step your angellist company profile shows “investors only” in the upper right under fundraising if you are 6b which is likely you want this isn’t legal advice – talk to your lawyer about the pros and cons about the various exemptions but understand that broadly speaking few institutional investors will ever invest in your company if you use the new broad solicitation rules – they simply don’t work as intended yet what the fg angels syndicate wants to see closing an investment is just another form of closing a sale for your company investors just have a different pain they are trying to solve – they want a big return on their investment make sure your investor messaging is clear on this in your angellist profile be sure to have your profile polished for example you’ll want video of your deck – if you have a good quality video of yourself presenting your deck great if not record your audio and put that with your slides we did this in house the production quality does not have to be stellar just clear and put it as an unlisted video on youtube you can then put the link in al product demo video product shots  screen shots every part of your profile completed current investors and total investment amount for this round angellist will show how much you are raising and how much is left in the raise so make sure the numbers are up to date by updating each closed investor prior to launch angellist comments and references for both your company and the founders if you don’t have these ask for them your networking should have brought you into contact with many people who are rooting for you – this is a way they can help you without investing money we had some high profile supporters who gave us comments just before the investment went live and this was a big help your website – make sure your website is up to date because the fg angels syndicate members will go from angellist right to your website to see what your customer messaging looks like and how you position your business what happens after the fg angels syndicate investment goes live you will have a lot of fundraising work to do in the week after the investment goes live members start to make reservations in the investment – you’ll see that is shown in the activity for both fg angels and your company on angellist members can also increase the amount they want to invest in your company members can also withdraw or cancel from the investment angellist will show your company as having raised the total backing amount of the syndicate which is overstated for the reasons already discussed and separately show the total backing amount  fg angels k these are shown on your company’s stats page  fundraising  manage  overview this total will initially be the full backing amount of the fg angels syndicate and will go down slowly as members withdraw yes slightly disheartening remember that this will be a good investment both from the funds standpoint and by having foundry group’s support note that most fg angels members will neither reserve nor withdraw your company will also get a lot of follows mostly from fg angels syndicate members and a lot of request for intros you should follow everyone who follows you and have a message prepared to send to each one u grok it’s message thanked them for following invited them to watch the pitch deck and demo videos and to contact us with any questions giving direct contact information also reply to each request for intro and expect these people to email you back usually with questions the request for intros are often investors who do more diligence about the investment some followers and request for intros are from investors who are not members of the fg angels syndicate but watch what the syndicate does to find new investments plan that most of the your week after the fg angels syndicate investment goes live will be spent courting angellist investors in our case we were also contacted by people who follow fg angels or one of the foundry partners but who are not part of the fg angels syndicate these people can become outside investors we are still conversing with a few that may be interested in our series a round some syndicate members may also wish to invest directly in addition to their participation in the syndicate u grok it has a new investor in this round who has a small amount in the fg angels syndicate but is investing substantially more directly this is a bit of an end around foundry so be careful here who you let in and whether they’re trying to simply piggback on fg angels wo paying the carry associated with doing so or if they’re legitimately interested in participating in the syndicate and so excited they want to invest more so don’t discount a syndicate member just because their syndicate participation may be low also to this point less than half of our syndicate investment came from investors at k or higher the majority was at  or lower closing the investment at your direction angellist will begin to close the fg angels investment this will allow syndicate members to start transferring their investments into the fund more on this below angellist will then select a closing date about a week after you start closing our investment opened on mon march  and angellist started closing on wed march 6 with an initial closing date of tuesday april  here is where you start to get an indication of how much you will actually raise from the fg angels syndicate members will start transferring their investment and in the stats  fundraising  manage  manage page you will see the amount that has been collected starts as  above a fourtabbed list all not started pending and collected in the “all” list you will see only the members who have not previously opted out of the investment and then you will see some members cancelyou will see the pending amount increase and then the collected amount increase as the pending amount decreases funds move from pending to collected starting to close doesn’t lock anyone out of the investment any member of the syndicate even if they did not opt in as most of them didn’t can transfer their investment during this part of the closing angellist will send a message to the fg angels members when the investment starts to close and another one a few days later reminding them to transfer their funds this is a great time to update the fg angels syndicate members in the not started group if you ask angellist they will send you a spreadsheet of the members with their email addresses so you can do a group bcc email with send you the link they need to click on to make their investment include some update on your company in our case we received a new glowing profile from a high profile angellist member and we were opening our online sales come up with something to update them about make sure this email goes only to the not started group angellist is also generally happy to extend the closing date if your pending investments are still going up we extended from april  to april  but the vast majority of the investment was in pending by april  when investments slow or stop in one to two weeks angellist will close the investment – this does keep members who have not started from joining the investment but keeps things open until the pending investments have been received the investment paperwork and details the fg angels syndicate investment is overseen by foundry group for which they receive the carry if the investment generates a return the company will have only two new investors fg angels and fg angels syndicate the fg angels syndicate members who invest in your company become part of a fund setup by foundry group through assure fund management someone from assure will contact you after the fg angels syndicate investment goes live on angellist to set up your funding vehicle this is separate from fg angel’s direct k investment if you have filled your round and are closed that is great if you still have room in your round we did since we had extended the round to ensure there was enough room for the fg angels syndicate then you can keep raising congrats – now what – investor relations with the syndicate technically you only have fg angels and funds managed by fg angels as your investors however some syndicate members will want to connect with you directly in our experience often on linkedin some will ask for updates and some will offer their help services connections advice this is evolving so there aren’t really any norms here yet on the one hand it is impossible for a small startup to effectively manage  new investors on the other hand these investors all now have a stake in your success and many are willing to help make that success happen so they can be quite beneficial to your startup you can send updates to the syndicate investors as a group through al in stats  fundraising  manage  manage where once the deal is finalized you will see a list of closed investors and didn’t close and on the right a message box with a link to “update investors or ask for advice” these updates are only visible to you and your investors we updated the investors when the round completely closes and plan on providing them major updates and perhaps a quarterly post while right now i send out a monthly or so email to our direct investors as well as field calls and make calls when there is a topic to discuss hopefully this overview is helpful in gaining an understanding of the angelist syndicate process in general and the fg angels process in particular of course this is a new and therefore evolving method for funding your business

to top january   ending our fg angels experiment after two years of a dedicated experiment we’ve decided to stop making new investments via our fg angels syndicate we’ve learned a lot achieved some of our goals but ultimately have decided that the effort required to maintain our investment pace on angellist is too great for us at least for now more on that in a bit but let’s start with some history the monday after angellist announced their syndicate product in september  we decided to to jump in with both feet and start fg angels as a result we were one of the very first syndicates and the first vc firm to create a syndicate we had several high level goals understand how angellist and syndicates worked by actively participating be able to experiment with seed investments outside of our themes extend our network of entrepreneurs and angel investors and generate additional economic returns for our funds it took a few months for angellist to gear up syndicates so that they actually worked as a result our first investment wasn’t made until early january when we invested in onthego platforms which was just acquired by atheer our plan was to make  investments directly committing m from our funds k from us for each investment through  when we did a retrospective on our first year of fg angels we had invested in  companies seth did a nice job of summarizing what the deals and the syndicate activity for the first year looked like total number of investments  average syndicate investment amount per deal k largest syndicate investment in any single deal k total number syndicate investors syndicate members who invested in at least one fg angels deal  total number of investors all investors who have joined fg angels in at least one deal   of investors who have participated in at least half of fg angels deals  most active syndicate member investment total 9k across  of our  fg angels deals  of investments with a female cofounder   our plan was not to generate investment deal flow for us to follow on with our main funds instead we took a one time seed investor approach patterned after an angel strategy that i’ve used for almost  years that has now generated a realized return over x invested capital and still has about half the money at play we’ve ended up investing in three companies through our main funds that we had invested in first with fg angels mattermark revolar and havenly however both revolar and havenly went through accelerator programs that we are involved with techstars and mergelane respectively which allowed us even more perspective into working with them we decided to continue making fg angels investments through  at about the same pace by the end of  we had made a total of 6 fg angels investments we have  funded backers a 6 unfunded backers a total syndicate backing of 966 and an estimated  day raise of  at the end of  we revisited the goals i mentioned at the beginning of this post let’s see how we did and what we learned goal  understand how angellist and syndicates worked by actively participating in addition to understanding in depth how angellist and syndicates worked i’d like to think we helped naval and his awesome team at angellist on figuring out the legal workflow and ux dynamics around angellist we’re fans of both angellist and syndicates and it was important to us to give back to the platform and help them work through the dynamics involved in creating and rolling out their syndicates product goal  be able to experiment with seed investments outside our themes while we did a lot of investments outside our themes we generated very little incremental learning on our part while we could be very helpful in a generic early investor way the time to value ratio was way off in both directions while we regularly did short quick hit help via email whenever someone wanted to spend an hour or more with one of us we eventually realized that our investment and ownership in the company was dramatically underweighted and this took time away we each have a finite number of hours each week from companies we had much larger investments in we also realized that we were getting the experimentation value and learning at a greater rate from our deep engagement in techstars goal  extend our network of entrepreneurs and angel investors as we expected our network of entrepreneurs was expanded by about  people across the 6 companies these founders are active members of our portfolio and our goal is to be helpful to them any way we can given time constraints however we have been disappointed in how we have – or haven’t – been effective at building a broader network of angel investors we’ve made some new friends and built strong connections with a few angels in the syndicate but we’ve struggled to build any kind of extended community the tools for this on angellist just aren’t there yet and we haven’t committed the resources to do this separately and ultimately some face to face time is likely needed which we haven’t been willing to do goal  generate additional economic returns for our funds we’ve invested about  million in fg angels and are excited about the portfolio however it’s a very early stage portfolio that will take a very long time to mature even when you include the carry we are getting on fg angels  this total amount represents less than one fund investment on our part our typical investment size is m to m with this growing to as much as m when you include our late stage fund even if we generate a huge multiple on our overall fg angels investment say x the impact on our fund return is limited given the size of the investments we were making ultimately we’ve decided that the effort that we are putting into fg angels is too great for us to continue on in the way that we’ve have been for the past two years however by running the experiment we’ve better understood the leverage points at the angel  seed level that angellist and syndicates create which for some investors and many entrepreneurs is very powerful finally we’d like to believe that we’ve contributed to the evolution and dynamic of angel  seed investing through this effort while we are no longer going to be actively making fg angels investments every now and then we might do something out of fg angels we continue to believe that angellist syndicates is an effective platform for companies and investors we simply felt that we needed to better balance the time and effort we were spending on fg angels relative to the weight it has in our overall portfolio it’s important to all of us at foundry group to experiment around the edges of our industry and to push the boundaries of the venture model to find new and innovative ways to create value for our investors while supporting as broad a set of entrepreneurs as possible we’ll continue to look for ways to do that vpandya this is an awesome article – hanuman chalisa rick moss – better ventures kudos to you and foundry group for doing this and sharing your learning can you put this into the context of venture investing doesn’t scale sounds like you’re saying it was more work than benefit versus focusing on your larger investments and getting many of the same benefits from working with accelerators and i also see a connection to your increased focus on investing in funds which is of course more scalable than syndicate investments thanks brad bfeld i would not put it in the context of venture investing doesn’t scale for example if we hired a dedicated partner to do this we could manage it or if we hired an associate whose job it was to organize leverage and get value out of the investor network being created that part would be more effective and while angellist has great software there’s a bunch of stuff missing that we would have liked we could have built a small team to write this… but we chose not to our core team strategy has been not to add anyone to stay very lean eg no associates and minimize overhead associated with managing a team that’s one of the strategy tradeoffs we’ve made and weren’t willing to change it for this we could have certainly put more money into each angellist deal instead of k but we wanted to solve the other things first dabelon awesome post what software toolsfeatures do you think are missing in terms of interacting with your investor network bfeld it’s a long list we spent some time sketching it out and then decided we were only dealing with it at a surface level so we stopped when we knew we weren’t going to execute on it rick moss – better ventures got it thanks again jud valeski awesome run down and transparency thanks pierre powell brad thanks it was fun i think we invested in all but two companies my experiementgoal was different we are oil  gas people and i look at investing in oil wells like investing in startups with not a normal distribution of return but a skewed distribution ie the mode median and mean are displaced my idea was if you invest in one company the most likely return is the mode which is displaced in a skewed distribution from the mean and it means you will mostlikely return less however if i can invest a little in a lot with someone smart at the helm then i can move my return from mode to mean the things i really didn’t consider is the syndicate angels really had a difficult time obtaining enough information on whether we should or even could invest in later rounds i’d want to follow your lead also not sure about all the logistics of returns and the like for example i know that onthegoplatforms was acquired not sure what that means for the syndicate or us as a syndicate angel many blessings bfeld re onthego – you should have received a message from them via angellist it was a stock for stock transaction – so we now own shares in aether the acquirer pointsnfigures that’s an interesting point on following on and pro rata chris amelinckx thanks brad do you have a suggestion for teams looking for angel investment with an affinity for the great work at foundry bfeld just email me we still make seed investments and will occasionally do something via fg angels tejdhawan once i get over the sadness i will reread and promise to understand the economics without emotion  thanks for all your team did to help the syndicated angel community grow past infancy bfeld smile frank w miller hmm interesting thanks for putting this together it has been an interesting way for me to dip my toe in the water for angel investing i’m only in five companies with little bitty investments but kinda fun i’m worried i have not been promiscuous enuff to have a good chance at that xx but i feel like one of them might in the future have something happen i guess we’ll see its been more than a year since these investments were made i guess the last bit of experience i gain will be how long it takes for any of these to come to a conclusion good or bad bfeld timing – expect at least a decade for full resolution – probably longer i’ve still got angel investments from the s that are live  active and successful companies mac a pattern has evolved every time over the past four years when you’ve returned from being off the grid it seems like big changes occur not certain what that forecast for  🙂 thanks for the fg angels experiment liked the idea of seed investing with foundry group in a leadership management role bfeld i think the timing is more around the end of the year and my sabbaticals have been in november which just happens to correspond when we have been making decisions around – or implementing – new big new things we have another thing we are winding down which i’ll blog about in the next few weeks where the decision was made nine months ago to make a major change in what we were doing and then another decision was made at the end of q to shut the initiative down we are in the “finishing it up and ready to talk about it” stage for that also dariel luciano neat post how did you guys go about thinking when it was time for you to move away from angellist was it a series of conversations that ended up in that decision or did you have a predetermined benchmark you wanted to hit and then stop just trying to understand how fg thinks about when it’s time to cut something off bfeld we talked about it a few times the first was at the end of  our first year of doing fg angels and decided to just continue for a whilethen we probably talked about it at the end of q and the end of q at the end of q we decided to finish the investments we had in our pipeline and then stop elizabeth kraus great post i benefited tremendously from my participation excellent diversification for a small amount of capital it increased my profile on angellist which has increased my credibility and our deal flow for mergelane seeing the terms of all of the deals was a great benchmark for setting valuations and terms i got to know the team at angellist and saw their ability to innovate on a dime and like you touched on it made me realize how hard it is to add value to a portfolio that big great learning for going forward i am  glad i did it but decided to take a break because the volume got a little overwhelming in the future i think i’ll continue to invest in syndicates but will  invest in syndicates investing in  or fewer deals per year or  lower my expectations of myself for tracking the deals and the updates i think viewing it more as a diversification tool and broad deal flow funnel makes more sense than trying to view it through the same lens as my other angel investments and re building the community of angels it might have had a bigger impact than you think it is really hard to figure out who is interested in angel investing and angellist is quickly changing that i’ve met at least twenty angels because they created a profile on angellist just to join your syndicate i’ve also had a few investors reach out to me because they saw my involvement with fg great impact for the ecosystem thanks for all of your hard work with this it made a difference bfeld super feedback re the network – that’s interesting and i hadn’t considered that jkostecki hi brad and thank you and seth for the analysis how did you guys go about doing due diligence on the companies you invested in i understand that your selection criteria was based on a thesis and experience but what other steps did you take to not only choose among the k startups listed on angel list of course not all of them are raising and then once you decided to consider the investment how did you vet the teams and the startups themselves bfeld it varied a lot but broke down into roughly three categories  we knew the founders already and had some relationship  we had a relationship with one of the lead angels who had done a lot of work already  random – and we had to do a new diligence process  and  were the majority of the investments we made sean interesting experiment – thanks for sharing the results with us all curious to hear what angellist’s response to this was have they been begging you to stay or simply accept it as over right away bfeld naval is a total gem and his team is excellent i sent him this post to review and he said “looks balanced and thoughtful brad thanks for running the experiment with us” he also had some other hypotheses about who  what situations with vcs angellist would work more effectively in i have enormous respect for naval and hope to have more opportunities to do things with him pete griffiths very interesting thanks rich weisberger seems like you could have used one slack across all the investments to limit your time commitment bfeld nope – slack would have never worked effectively for this the nature of the syndicate is very dynamic since individual angels can invest in whichever companies they want so it’s a complex manytomany relationship with us in the middle email doesn’t work effectively either rich weisberger oh i see i thought the problem was dealing with communications between the sydicate lead and the portfolio companies bfeld nope angellist does that very well james green drowning worms very interesting brad it’s interesting that a vc found it hard to build a network of angels i know as an angel it’s also hard to build a network of vcs perhaps also due to limited time but on both sides there’s clearly a willingness and appetite for some kind of angelvc introduction service if you find something that fits the bill please share it if i come up with something i’ll message you somehow all the best and thanks for the info bfeld i thought more of the angels would be proactive about developing a relationship with us that was an incorrect assumption on my part william mougayar re  “we have been disappointed in how we have – or haven’t – been effective at building a broader network of angel investors” – my guess is that the al tools that “aren’t there” relate to potentially some crm of sorts that could interweave all these angels into a manageable relationship management bfeld correct we thought about trying a few different approaches but given the dynamic nature of the syndicate and who participates in each deal this didn’t make sense to do outside of angellist pointsnfigures cool that you are being so transparent about it what i am curious about is off all the investments how many have raised another round did they do traditional vcor did they raise it on angel list how many failed fast too soon to ask about exits my own experienceperception of angel list is that if a company wants to raise money they need to have raised some prior to listing on angel list they also should have a name lead investor angel list is a great development and there are a lot of other platforms trying to follow them on the flip side it gets seed stage companies the capital they need but not necessarily the mentorship guidance they need based on your and other experiences i have heard bfeld it’s too early to analyze the outcome data many of the companies are still in the round they raised a few have failed a decent number have raised another round and one has been acquired we’ll do an analysis at some point in the future – but probably in another year or two pointsnfigures makes sense huge respect to you for putting it out there as transparently as you have mike porath brad thanks for experimenting with fg angels your investment in the mighty gave us the time to focus on doing what we needed to do to raise the next round happy to be a very small part of foundry’s portfolio bfeld thanks – and our pleasure we look forward to continuing to help eric ver ploeg huge admiration for you guys in trying this experiment of course most experiments don’t pan out but getting in early and learning as much as you can is way better than sitting back and watching bfeld yup – it’s the best way to learn james routledge we run the largest syndicate in europe and i can definitely sympathise with you on points  and   angellist is a great product but it is still buggy and lacking good ux the legals and completion process is still messy and time consuming too i don’t think they’ve taken the pain out of that yet  al has good liquidity and a lot of investors on its platform yet to form a relationship with a new investor and get them to actively fund your syndicate deals takes a lot of work to do this still requires a facetoface relationship fundamentally angels still invest with who they actually know and most importantly trust thanks for sharing your learnings on it nickmoran awesome post sad to no longer see regular fg angels deals while actively running the syndicate is no longer the right strategy for fg what are your thoughts on benefitsdrawbacks for individual angels investing via syndicates bfeld i think it’s an awesome platform for that alex mathews thanks for the transparency brad in addition to hiring a potential vpassociate to run this what about the added benefit of translating followon pro rata rights into special purpose vehicles via al in this case the deal flow originally not the intention of fg angles could become meaningful for your main fg lps if given that exposure no bfeld i think this is going to be a curious debate over the next few years i’m not convinced of the argument about soaking up all the prorata rights especially at the early stages and it’s not important for us or our lps as a fund since we foundry group certainly have the capability to do that from our main fund if we want lunarmobiscuit another experience that demonstrates how difficult it is to replace an experience based on trust with a seemingly more efficient process based online thanks for sharing the details meanwhile two years ago you were worrying about the  investor limit in the syndicate was that ever actually an issue and did you have to turn away some of those  investors in any of the deals or did angellist find a workaround bfeld the  investor limit is and continues to be an issue vineet thanks for the opportunity to invest with fg in the syndicates from the very beginning it’s been great to see the wide array of companies and in a few cases i’ve been able to broker introductions for a few founders despite my very small stake given the deal flow volume it was tough at times to keep up with even basic analysis of the investment opportunities as there often wasn’t a large enough lead time from announcement to closing at least not enough for me if you delve into these waters again perhaps there is a way for active syndicate members to join a secure private community discussion of the opportunities contributing our expertise where applicable before the deals reach a close i think we’d all be able to accelerate our knowledge advancement this way if you even opt to pick up education  learning  edtech as a theme area and want a large company and startup perspective feel free to drop a line helping would be the least i can do thanks again and all the best for a great  and beyond tom george i am the founder of a company and a first time ceo i am here basically looking for advice on what to do with my company here is my situation we are still in startup mode however we are making money i have always been an entrepreneur at heart and i have managed to retain  percent of the company i realize now in order to bring my vision to fruition i am going to need the right team and also some funding to get the company moving is this the purpose of seed funding and if so can someone please lead me in the right direction i want to start taking the necessary steps to acquire the resources we need any advice is much appreciated elena borodina it’s mind boggling and sad how much money is wasted on bad people and bad ideas you could build so much more instead and with less in fact having so much cash on hand i don’t see how these angel investors and especially vcs don’t just bring all of this startup development in house a solid working prototype of most of these startups would cost k especially with a solid trusted goto team you own all the equity reuse back office avoid startup mistakes avoiding wasting money need uber of x cashcows easy need zerotoone breakthroughs like google’s algorithm invite tech geniuses who want to create rather than raise money and party in san francisco i only see upsides patrick foley sorry if this is a stupid question but would it make more sense to “invest” in individual angels presumably you could limit to angels that fit a certain profile low time sink at minimum you could magnify their impact on their portfolio companies and maybe get  in  great follow on investment outside of my world but i’m just curious if that would work twitter facebook
