from the sale of the common stock and intend to use the proceeds from this offering to continue implementing the business and marketing plan the expenses of this offering including the preparation of this prospectus and the filing of this registration statement estimated at  are being paid for by us our budgetary allocations may vary however depending upon the percentage of proceeds that we obtain from the offering for example we may determine that it is more beneficial to allocate funds toward securing potential financing and business opportunities in the short term rather than to conserve funds to satisfy continuous disclosure requirements for a longer period developing distributing and selling apps is a highly competitive business characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms technologies and storefronts with respect to competing for consumers of our game related apps we will compete primarily on the basis of game quality brand and customer reviews we will compete for promotional and digital storefront placement based on these factors as well as our relationship with the storefront owner historical performance perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands properties and other content with respect to our legal apps we will compete on the basis of providing the most up to date content the app’s ease of use navigation and readability and its price as compared to similar product offerings we also will compete for experienced and talented employees and independent contractors we believe that our small size will allow provide us a competitive edge for the time being and allow us to make quick decisions as to product development to take advantage of consumer preferences at a particular point in time with respect to our game apps we compete with a continually increasing number of companies including industry leaders such as activision dena disney electronic arts ea mobile gameloft gree gungho online entertainment king digital entertainment nexon warner brothers and zynga and many wellfunded private companies including kabam machine zone rovio storm team lava and supercell we could also face increased competition if large companies with significant online presences such as apple google amazon facebook or yahoo choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games in addition given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals in all of our segments who are able to create and launch apps and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited startup time or expertise as an example of the competition that we face it has been estimated that more than  million applications including more than  active games were available on apple’s us app store as of december   the proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players and users who purchase content for their devices without substantially increasing marketing or development costs with respect to our legalrelated apps we compete with a number of well established companies that offer similar apps including lexisnexis westlaw cch bna and bloomberg law reports we may face increased competition from established or newly organized entities and from the governmental offices and agencies that promulgate the laws and regulations that are the subject of our apps should they decide to make versions of such laws and regulations available to consumers most of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us including · significantly greater financial and personnel resources · stronger brand and consumer recognition · the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and nonmobile products · more substantial intellectual property of their own · lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale and · broader distribution and presence company description appsoft develops publishes and markets mobile software applications for smartphones and tablet devices “apps” we currently own a portfolio comprising over  apps titles including games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of consumers and legalrelated apps that provide compilations of federal and state laws and regulations across a variety of legal disciplines and digests of court decisions rendered by federal courts consumers download our apps through directtoconsumer digital storefronts such as the apple app store and google play store we currently generate revenue from sales or downloads or of apps and from advertisements published on our ad supported game titles some of our most popular titles include games legal related titles jumping chicken bankruptcy code raid pro code of federal regulations cfr ancient man warrior legal dictionary axe the brave  dragon slayer us supreme court cases apocalypse jump pro new york penal code avro avenger pro united states code we offer all of our game titles in both a free advertisementsupported version and a paid version that does not display ads we believe that the ad supported versions allow for wider dissemination of our titles to consumers who might not otherwise spend money for an app without first playing the game we are in the process of migrating the game programs into our corporate structure which may take some time in view of the fact that in some cases our contract programmers must rewrite certain lines of code in the game when we acquired our portfolio of apps the content of all of our legalrelated titles was out of date in that they did not include laws and regulations adopted since the time they were last updated or make reference to legal decisions rendered during the period between the last update and the date we acquired them we have started the process of updating the content and are focusing our initial efforts on titles that we believe have the greatest revenue generating potential in order to generate consumer interest in our legalrelated titles and increase downloads and avoid returns we will be have to update and maintain content on a consistent basis over the last several years mobile devices including smartphone and tablets have proliferated extensively around the world across a wide range of demographic groups the mobile apps industry has experienced corresponding growth in the number of downloads the number and types of apps published we believe that there will continue to be an increase in the number of smartphones and tablets sold in addition technological advances to these devices including more powerful smartphones and tablets with larger screens make mobile apps provide a platform for more diverse apps and make games more fun and visually appealing we believe that technological developments will continue to drive growth in our industry for the foreseeable future each member of our management team has an extensive background in mobile digital and social media sales advertising operations and technology and product development and deployment we expect to leverage management’s industry experience and the contacts they have developed to our advantage we plan to develop and acquire new apps to expand our existing product offerings we may seek to create games based on thirdparty brands properties and other content including those that we may license from the owners of television programs cartoons movies and toy manufacturers we expect to develop games that can be downloaded without charge that offer ingame currency and ingame purchasing as additional revenue streams we also may seek to develop social media and other apps we will rely on third party designers developers and programs to develop new apps we also will solicit ideas for new titles from unrelated parties we evaluate prospects based on a variety of factors if we conclude that a particular prospect is worth pursuing we may fund the development of the app through launch and beyond we market sell and distribute our games through directtoconsumer digital storefronts such as apple’s app store and the google play store we currently or expect to advertise our apps through the digital storefronts our own website social media such as facebook and linkedin through mobile ad networks and search engine optimization seo tools
