size weight and power swap of next generation air vehicles including aircraft rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicles uav satellites and missiles  seven years ago general nano’s engineers began developing veelo™ with the clear goal of driving sustainability and improving science  we believe that impacting st century priorities is not somebody else’s responsibility – it’s ourstoday general nano works sidebyside leading technologists at the department of defense nasa and global aerospace and defense companies to transition veelo™ into realworld applications including multifunctional carbon fiber composites deicing and antiicing systems lightweight data cables lightning strike protection emi shielding and blackbody calibrators for advanced satellite imaginggeneral nano is rapidly growing because of its highcaliber relationships ability to collaborate and technical skill the company has distinguished itself by creating a manufacturing process that empowers engineers to design products with uniquely tailored properties that deliver new levels of application performance for example veelo heat™ veelo shield™ and veelo strike™ are supplied in continuous sheet tape and film forms and can be customized by electrical mechanical and thermal properties veelo blac™ is a specialty coating product optimized at the nanoscale and manufactured on devicesize or macroscale substrates  in  veelo blac™ will be launched on a nasa cubesat to measure earth sciences this is possible because veelo blac™ outperforms existing technology and is supplied in a product form that customers can seamlessly integrate without changing manufacturing processesdriving sustainability improving science and impacting st century priorities is our purpose  if you share our passion to create technologies that enable society to perform smarter™ contact us after all our mission started in response to a simple question from a visionary that contacted us seven years ago  “what’s the plan for

information in space is that you get stray light from the stars and the sun” he said “the nanotubes absorb light wavelengths really well”what’s a carbon nanotubeit’s a carbon atom in the shape of a cylinder – and nature doesn’t make them that way general nano “grows” them by planting “seeds” of tiny metallic particles on a surface then exposing them to gases temperatures and pressures that curl up that carbon the process takes three to  minutes depending on the length of the tube requiredat the atomic level nanotubes are more conductive than copper and stronger than steel sprengard said they’re very useful in industries such as aerospace where light strong and conductive material is needed ceo joseph sprengard worked in finance and development for a strategy consulting firm before coming on board at general nano llc photo provided what’s so great about general nano’s nanotubesthe company makes the tubes into continuous rolls that are easy to handle and apply in known manufacturing processes sprengard said customers can cut those rolls into sheets and put them into carbon fiber composites to make them stronger and conductive general nano is the only supplier of continuous carbon nanotube sheet products in the united states sprengard said he knows this through contacts with customers and suppliers he said the sheets make up about  percent of the business he said the other  percent is “vertically aligned” nanotubes not made into sheets but used as antireflective material such as will be used in the satellite who started the businessit was founded by university of cincinnati nanoworld lab directors vesselin shanov and mark schulz who made a breakthrough in nanotube technology in  the us air force learned about it and asked them if they had plans to commercialize the technology sprengard was asked to help bring the product to market he previously worked in finance and development for a strategy consulting firm and in commercial banking“they needed someone who could dedicate himself full time to launching the business” he said the three men own the company along with a silent partnerhow big is the businessrevenue was a record  million in  the company doesn’t reveal customers’ names sprengard said but it has contracts with seven of the top  aerospace contractors in the united states there are four employees including sprengard but about  others are involved though contract partnerships subcontracts and research contractsthe company has raised  million from investors and development contracts from customers who need for example proof of concept for a product that includes a  million investment from ohio third frontier a state program designed to create tech jobs which the company used to buy its first round of manufacturing equipment“generally businesses like ours are not overly exciting to investors until they need growth capital” sprengard said “that’s why it’s so very important that government makes investments because the commercial market will not do that”what’s nextgeneral nano is growing and needs more room so a new facility is on the horizon the owners are looking for a building in the tristate and expect to move by the end of  currently offices are in the hamilton county development center with manufacturing done at offsite locationsmeanwhile management is looking at new markets such as shielding for the wire and cable industry as well as deicing and antiicing systems and the company soon will change its focus from research to production with an emphasis on quality control and control of expenseskey to general nano’s success is not trying to grow too fast sprengard said which has been the downfall of many nanotube companies“i’m proud of our team” he said “we’ve got a bunch of highly skilled folks who are very focused on deliverables that allows a young company to win” share article related jets could be tracked via satellite important nasa launch pushed to friday a
