relate to startup performance summaryhttpsworksbepresscomdianesullivanpscholars agree that entrepreneurs’ networks and knowledge are important during early venture formation and recent network research has begun investigating how the interplay between entrepreneurs’ knowledge sets and overall network structure eg overall network size relate to venture performance little research has examined how entrepreneurs’ knowledge and emsubsetsem eg family friends coworkers etc of network ties relate to performance outcomes one subset of ties recently studied is family versus nonfamily ties although thorough investigation has been neglected this is problematic because some research suggests benefits accrued from family ties may vary from nonfamily ties this paper examines and finds that

“em…involves…the processes ofem discovery evaluation emand exploitation of opportunitiesem” despite its importance and the research attention it has received to date the process of opportunity recognition oprec is not as well understood as it might be our study adds to the literature by combining regulatory focus rf with elements from prior research on creativity to expand the conceptual understanding of oprec some scholars have described oprec as a creative process others have tested the effects of rf on creativity but to date no one has combined the two in a single experimental

httpsworksbepresscomdianesullivanentrepreneurial cognitiongender differences in entrepreneurship assessing perceptions of entrepreneurial outcomes among men and women entrepreneurs summaryhttpsworksbepresscomdianesullivanpa wide variety of research has examined performance differences between women and men entrepreneurs while many studies find significant differences between men and women in regards to economic outcomes explanations for these differences vary widely this is problematic as we believe that the real reason for differences stems from the entrepreneurial outcomes emphasized by women versus men entrepreneurs women utilize and emphasize relationships with others differently during the entrepreneurial process in an effort to realize desired outcomes as a result the assumption that men and women want the same outcomes ie economic outcomes from venturing may be misguided this paper examines and finds that male and female entrepreneurs differ in regards to several relationship oriented noneconomic entrepreneurial outcomes while showing no differences in regards to traditional economic outcomesp httpsworksbepresscomdianesullivanwomen entrepreneursnetwork

resources wu wang chen  pan  interestingly while research has investigated antecedents to and consequences of engaging in network relationships most research has focused on consequences hoang  antoncic  resultantly a gap has emerged in our understanding of how entrepreneurs’ networks develop and change over time this is problematic because some scholars contend that changing resource needs during venture development necessitate a concomitant change in entrepreneurs’ networks to allow access to newlyneeded resources greve  salaff  hite  hesterly  if entrepreneurs’ networks need to evolve over time as resource requirements change more research is needed studying their dynamics to address this we explore two questions – how does the size of an earlystage entrepreneur’s network affect
