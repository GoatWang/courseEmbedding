starting a c corporation are nonus residents allowed to own a corporation or llc there are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a c corporation or an llc the scorporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders owner but any us citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder owner you would of course require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process known as the registered agent address but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a c corporation or an llc in what state should i form my llc or corporation unless you plan on having a large multistate operation it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is locatedgenerally speaking most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business andor a physical presence in that state if you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign out of state company with your home state which will subject you to all of the fees taxes and regulations of that state what are the differences between officers directors and shareholders a corporation consists of all three officers directors and shareholders shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders officers are selected by the directors and run the daytoday operations of the corporation these do not need to be separate people any person can fill all three positions in small businesses one person can be the only shareholder the only director and the only officer what is a c corporation a c corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation note the c in c corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code c corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations c corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to passthrough to the personal income tax statements of the owners as such c corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities c corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business if desired and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income c corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends but this can also lead to double taxation what is stock par value par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares it doesnt necessarily reflect their real value and is typically set at a low value ie one dollar or one cent the par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class the shares can be sold to the initial shareholders at par value or more but the price must be the same for each share not all states require a par value unless you specify otherwise incfile will authorize  shares this is due to the fact that  is easily divisible by      with a par value of one cent or at no par value if not required by your state what are bylaws the bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws bylaws are not filed with the state learn

locatedgenerally speaking most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business andor a physical presence in that state if you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign out of state company with your home state which will subject you to all of the fees

real value and is typically set at a low value ie one dollar or one cent the par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class the shares can be sold to the initial shareholders at par value or more but the price must be the same for each share not all states require a par value unless you specify otherwise incfile will authorize  shares this is due to the fact that  is easily divisible by      with a par value of one cent or at no par value if not required by your state what are bylaws the
