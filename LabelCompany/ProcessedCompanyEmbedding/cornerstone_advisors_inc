bradstreet inc  all rights reserved home     cornerstone investment advisors inc is a wealth management company helping clients manage all aspects of their personal investments and finances  we serve as your liaison to all issues relating to your financial well being  we are here to help simplify your financial picture and save you time and money in dealing with your financial affairs  cornerstone has been in business since 994  one of our primary roles is managing investment portfolios on a discretionary basis for investors in need of professional portfolio management  we cater to those investors who dont want the responsibility of managing their own investment portfolios  and because each of our clients has different risk tolerances and expectations we customize each portfolio to match individual needs and circumstances  we manage investment portfolios for individuals and businesses we manage taxable investment accounts retirement accounts and company retirement plans  in addition to managing your investments we use our wealth analyzer on a regular basis to help identify any areas of your financial picture that require further attention  the wealth analyzer is an in depth questionnaire that covers all aspects of your financial affairs  and since financial pictures can often change we meet with our clients on a regular basis to review any changes to their wealth analyzer  based on our findings we may call in other experts to help deal with any important issues which need to be addressed  we will also work with any preferred professionals that you currently have good relationships with  we work strictly on an asset based fee which is determined on the value of your entire investment portfolio  we dont get paid commissions based on transactions  nor do we accept any kickbacks from other professionals that we may refer clients to  this eliminates any conflicts of interest and puts us on the same side of the table with our clients  too many investors allow commission sales reps to manage their investment affairs  this can be hazardous to your financial well being  and we aim to eliminate that disadvantage for all our clients
