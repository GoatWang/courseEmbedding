this page continue reading the main story when william j stromberg studies a stock for his growthandincome fund at t rowe price he is not looking for growth at any price or even for high income what interests him are growth at a reasonable price and a dividend with the potential to rise it is all the better if the stock is cheap and the company has some extra cash in its coffers ready for a possible acquisitionmr strombergs strategy for the  yearold t rowe price dividend growth fund is to buy companies whose earnings and dividends he expects to rise consistently and he tries to buy the stocks when they are out of favor for a temporary reason the art is figuring out which ones are only down temporarily and thats where judgment comes in he said in particular we look for companies whose relative dividend yield is unusually highcurrently the funds average dividend yield  the amount paid on each share divided by the share price  is  percent compared with an average of  percent for the standard  poors  mr stromberg looks for companies with dividend yields at twothirds of the market yield or highermatt muehlbauer research manager of the value line mutual fund survey says the

has about  stocks and a median market capitalization of  billion versus  billion for the s p  about  percent of the portfolio is invested in financial services  percent in real estate investment trusts  percent in consumer products  percent in capital equipment and  percent in energy theres unusually good value in these sectors relative to other sectors he said adding that he makes big bets away from these areas only when he sees extraordinary valuesmr stromberg  saw the decline in technology stocks in july as an opportunity to look over a dozen or so that might meet his criteria he bought hewlettpackard alco standard a technology services company and analysts international an outplacement concern for technology services businesses while the fund held no technology stocks before the decline he said they were now about  percent of his portfoliothe fund fared relatively well in july in large part because of the absence of technology stocks this year through july  it had a total return of  percent compared with an average of  percent for its peers according to morningstar with the market rally since then the funds return for the year has improved to  percent compared with  percent for the peer groupmr strombergs favorite stocks have something in common  free cash flow or cash beyond what is needed to run a business it allows the companies to actively acquire smaller
