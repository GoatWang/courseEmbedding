multiplier share loading the player what is the equity multiplier the equity multiplier is calculated by dividing a companys total asset value by total net equity and it measures financial leverage companies finance their operations with equity or debt so a high equity multiplier indicates that a larger portion of asset financing is attributed to debt the equity multiplier is a variation of the debt ratio and its definition of debt financing includes all liabilitiesbreakcalculation of the equity multiplier is relatively simple and straightforward consider the balance sheet of apple inc as of march  the companys total assets were  billion and the book value of shareholder equity was  billion the companys equity multiplier was therefore  verizon communications inc operates a very different business model with more financial leverage the companys total assets were  billion as of march  with  billion of shareholder equity the equity multiplier was  based on these valuesleverage analysisverizons much lower proportionate shareholder equity value indicates that the business relies more heavily on financing from debt and other liabilities the companys telecommunications business model is reminiscent of utilities firms which have stable predictable cash flows and typically carry high debt levels verizons closest peer att inc also has one of the highest equity multipliers among the largest companies traded on us exchanges though it is much lower at  than verizons ratio of apple is an established mature business that can comfortably service debt and it has issued notes to gain access to capital at relatively attractive costs however the company is more susceptible to changing economic conditions or evolving industry standards than utilities or large telecommunications firms as a result apple has less financial leverage these differences in business models mean that higher financial leverage does not necessarily indicate superior financial healthdupont analysisthe equity multiplier is an important factor in dupont analysis which is a method of financial assessment devised by the dupont corporation for the purpose of internal review the dupont model breaks return on equity roe into its constituent pieces which are popular financial ratios and metrics net profit margin asset turnover and the equity multiplier are combined to calculate roe which allows analysts to consider the relative of each impact separately if roe changes over time or diverges from normal levels for the peer group dupont analysis indicates how much of this is attributable to financial leverage if the equity multiplier fluctuates it can significantly impact roe higher financial leverage drives roe upward all other factors remaining equal breaking down equity multiplier

equitymultiple expects investment volume to grow by an order of magnitude tweet share share  reddit pin emailshares  january     pm by jd alois real estate crowdfunding may possess the biggest potential within the sector of online investment marketplaces the ability to make a popular asset class more accessible to a wider audience simply makes sense both debt and equity investment opportunities in real estate are available across multiple platforms but some of the early entrants have struggled while others have thrived inman in their  real estate industry outlook says there is solid optimism for  the majority of their survey respondents expect the incoming trump administration to have a positive effect on the us housing market  of course if the economy holds commercial real estate should do well too rising interest rates will certainly play a role that could temper growth but many industry participants are positive about the coming year this holds true even more in vibrant metropolitan markets like new york  where everyone agrees is the fact that emerging technology will play an increasingly important role for investors developers and sellers   with equitymultiple we have a pretty amazing product crowdfunding is just the beginning — jordan ray jordray november   equitymultiple a real estate crowdfunding platform describes itself as the only online investing platform backed by an established real estate company – mission capital this relationship provides a solid backstop that can help with access to deals and institutional horsepower while mission capital does big deals equitymultiple sees itself as a perfect fit in matching accredited investors to opportunity in the  million to  million range crowdfund insider last spoke with equitymuliple ceo and cofounder charles clinton at the beginning of  at that time he said that in a few years it will seem ridiculous that we weren’t managing our real estate portfolio in an etrade type environment crowdfund insider caught up with charles just before the end of the year to get an update on equitymultiple and their expectations for the coming year crowdfund insider since we last spoke early  how has equitymultiple grown how much investment has been transacted by your platform charles clinton it’s been a very exciting year to date equitymultiple investors have invested in  offerings  closed two still live total investment for q looks like it will more than double q and overall total investment on the platform has tripled since the end of q of this year crowdfund insider how is deal flow we are hearing that it has become more competitive to find good deals charles clinton our pipeline of deals and opportunities remains strong in fact in q and going into q of  we have more deals lined up than in our entire first year of business  finding good deals is never easy but our segment of the market – commercial real estate as opposed to single family – isn’t the focus of many other major platforms we also continue to benefit from our partnership with mission capital advisors which has afforded us access to institutionallevel sponsorship and opportunities  more broadly speaking we’re also seeing increased institutional appetite and acceptance for the online capital space we’re now having conversations with sponsors who wouldn’t have considered online capital raising even a year ago – they’re interested but also selective about who they’ll partner with  they’re looking for people that speak their language and can understand the nuances of deal and that’s where we stand out between our team and our partnership with mission there’s a lot of real estate knowledge to leverage  as the market has gotten frothy deals have become competitive and we see some valuations that just don’t make sense — so we pass on those opportunities  we remain focused on finding the right operators that share our view on appropriate riskadjusted returns  quality over quantity is and will remain our mantra but there is no shortage of opportunities we are seeing  crowdfund insider how are net returns holding up for debt  equity investors are investors becoming more selective charles clinton our investors have been very pleased for deals that are already cashflowing annualized cash returns are over  this includes fixedrate investments in senior loans fixed rate preferred equity investments and distributions from cashflowing equity deals this year investors have already been fully repaid principal on three deals and we have zero loss of principal to date many of our equity projects are longer hold periods with upside coming at sale or refinance after several years we encourage our investors to be selective and to ask questions many of our initial and now repeat investors are from the real estate industry and if anyone is likely to be selective that’s the group we learned very early on that being responsive to investor questions and concerns was essential and it’s really become a mantra of our company i think if anything the more we interact with our investors and the more performing deals we have behind us the easier it is for new investors to come on board crowdfund insider what percentage of the investment is from individuals vs institutional money charles clinton nearly  of our investors are individuals and noninstitutional entities and trusts that may change as our deal size gets larger but we remain focused on providing individuals with the best institutional real estate opportunities in the market crowdfund insider can you quantify the importance of your relationship with mission capital not all platforms have a relationship like this charles clinton it’s difficult to quantify but we believe it’s a huge leg up on other platforms investors have the added comfort of knowing that the mission capital senior leadership in involved in the sourcing and vetting of our deals despite technological advances real estate is still so much about bootsontheground experience and relationships we believe that our partnership with mission really strengthens the value we provide to our investors crowdfund insider last time we spoke you said you were looking at reg a since that time several platforms have leveraged the updated security exemption will you do the same charles clinton we have no immediate plans to but we will continue to evaluate new ways to provide value to investors crowdfund insider can you make a prediction for equitymultiple and  charles clinton we’re excited about our  growth and expansion plans  we believe that  will see the broader acceptance of online funding not just by emerging managers but by far more established operators that recognize the potential of the space this will be a positive development for both investors and the longterm health of the industry online investing is a long tail business – investors aren’t buying widgets so deal and sponsor quality are essential for longterm success with our partnership with mission and focus on commercial transactions we believe we’re wellpositioned to attract top deals and sponsors in  we expect to increase the average equitymultiple allocation into the deals we do and ramp up our overall deal count we expect total investment volume through our platform to grow by an order of magnitude to do this we’ll continue to expand our investor network and we plan to explore some creative benefits for our repeat investors finally we have some exciting improvement plans for our technology platform and investor experience crowdfund insider how well funded is equitymultiple i am hearing some chatter that some undercapitalized platforms may disappear charles clinton i can’t speak to the capitalization of some of our competitors but our focus is certainly on the long term our partnership with mission a wellcapitalized and successful firm gives us the comfort and confidence to weather any blips and shortterm shocks in the economy  that said we’re
