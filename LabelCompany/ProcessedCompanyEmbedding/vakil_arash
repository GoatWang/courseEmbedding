share this page continue reading the main story after graduating from queens college in  arash vakil worked as a product manager for a software company living on the second floor of his parents’ house in flushing queens he had few expenses over time his savings grewso mr vakil bought a onebedroom condominium in a brandnew building on purves street in hunters point a quickly developing areahe did not intend to live there the condo was much too nice for him he said “i don’t need highend finishes or heated floors in the bathroom i saw it as an investment opportunity” advertisement continue reading the main story all he needed to be happy at home “a couch and a highspeed internet connection” he saidmr vakil  whose family immigrated from iran when he was an infant continued studying for an mba at baruch college when he graduated two years ago he began hunting for another place this time he wanted to buy a small building he could occupy one unit and rent out the rest continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story he didn’t want another condo every month when he paid the common charge he felt the money was going for some intangible use as a building owner he would be able to “actually see where it’s going” he said “i have more flexibility with what i want to do with that money” photo arash vakil  started by fixing up his rentals then took on his own place credit hiroko masuikethe new york times mr vakil loved queens “the most diverse place on the planet” he said but he was in the market for something near manhattan or an express subway stop because he was eager to shed his lengthy commute from flushing which was a bus ride from the last stop on the  trainhe wanted an occupied place too so he would have rent coming in immediately his top price was  per unitmr vakil who is now a product manager for a video chat company set up computer feeds from assorted realestate sites checking daily “i could filter down exactly what i wanted” he said suitable houses however were in short supplyhe was interested in a hunters point house listed for  but the commercial space on the ground floor was used as two studio apartments no certificate of occupancy was on file with the department of buildings “i couldn’t spend that time or aggravation” to convert the structure to a legal threefamily mr vakil saidat a threefamily on rd street in woodside queens listed for  the inspection showed some problems he was unwilling to tackle the building was coowned by two parties one of whom later bought out the other photo on rd street in woodside queens a threefamily needed repairs credit hiroko masuikethe new york times his favorite was a lovely fourfamily house on st street in elmhurst listed at  “it was fully occupied and i knew i was going to have rent from day ” mr vakil said but negotiations with another buyer were already far along that house sold for  advertisement continue reading the main story so he took another look at a threefamily brick row house he had seen in astoria on rd street the owner who had lived in the middle unit had died and had left the house to his niece and nephewmr vakil was glad it was a brick building “i think they look nicer i think they stand stronger” he said it had a small paved backyard with rose bushes and the property included a twocar garage reached by an alley behind the house the place near three train stops was much closer to manhattan than his parents’ houseat  however the house seemed overpriced the inspector found some leaks the roof was adequate but wouldn’t last much longer the garage which had termite damage needed an overhaul“those were points of negotiation” mr vakil sadi “so i could bring the price down even further” photo someone else snapped up a nice building on st street in elmhurst credit hiroko masuikethe new york times last fall he bought the house for  annual taxes are around  the topfloor tenant was paying  a month for a twobedroom with an office the groundfloor tenants a couple who had been there for decades paid  a month garage includedhe renovated the middle floor and rented it out for  — more than he expected when it came time to renovate the apartments of the tenants on the other two floors they left willingly he said “they knew they had been getting a great deal for many many years”he did most of the work which included plumbing and painting on the upper floors he learned a great deal from his father he said — and more from howto videos online“youtube has been fantastic for showing me how to lay down tiles or even the most efficient way to paint” he said “it’s someone who’s going to walk you through it and show you exactly what you are going to be doing i have friends who are also handy and are more than willing to help me i am always learning something new which is cool” advertisement continue reading the main story he rented out the top floor for  a month — again more than he expected the rent includes wifi which he set up for his tenants photo on rd street in astoria a threefamily seemed to fit the bill credit hiroko masuikethe new york times for the ground floor to be his apartment he brought in a contractor his squarefoot twobedroom is nearing the end of a gut renovationlast winter despite the mild weather “oil costs were astounding” mr vakil said the house came with an old and inefficient boiler “and i couldn’t wait to sign a contract to get that out of the way” the new heating system uses gas instead and each unit will have its own thermostatthe renovation is taking longer than he anticipated and at around  costing more he expects to move in sometime next monthhis parents keep asking “are you sure you want to leave” he said “they think i won’t know what to do in the kitchen but i think i am quite all right there” his mother worries he won’t eat enough fruithe did briefly consider renting out the ground floor and staying put in flushing “a lot of my friends and older coworkers they are always trying to give me advice” he said “and they always said stay home for as long as you possibly can and save that money”but he thought about the long flushing commute and concluded that “this was the right path for me”with his highspeed internet in place he is now in the market for furniture for that very important couch “i was thinking something large and lshaped” he said “so that i can have people over and have it as an entertaining space too” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think for sale for rent
