identity – the epicenter from which all things come   quantx etfs innovative etf solutions risk managed funds dynamic beta fund what we do quantitative research we are quants passion for quantitative analysis is what brought our team together blue sky was founded on research and development of new ideas on products with practical application our research etf sponsor we launched a series of etfs in january of  focused on two areas dynamic beta etf designed to create smarter risk exposure relative to their benchmarks security selection and portfolio beta are optimized in order to maximize upside

solactive one of our partner index providers our indices separate account manager we launched blue sky in  to provide separate account solutions to institutions and advisors and their clients our flagship dynamic asset allocation strategies broadly seek to enhance riskadjusted returns in all market conditions by overweighting risk assets in periods of market strength and overweighting defensive assets in periods of market weakness investment philosophy “when events change i change my mind what do you do” — paul samuelson – nobel prize winner and father of dynamic asset allocation all investment strategies are based upon a set of assumptions or historical research including buy and hold economic regimes constantly change interest rates inflation and equity markets can move substantially up or down and significantly impact portfolio returns unlike endowments investors do not have an infinite time horizon for this reason we believe that a traditional strategic asset allocation approach based on modern portfolio theory is suboptimal it makes more sense to adapt to changes in the economic environment we favor a dynamic approach to asset allocation using market information to guide our investment decisions most importantly we believe that a systematic quantitative approach is necessary to avoid emotions and biases in decisionmaking we believe that an ongoing commitment to research is the foundation of our investment philosophy it is the key to uncovering new and actionable information that can be used to further enhance existing models and to develop new strategies the snowflake  simple yet elegantly complex “simple can be harder than complex you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple but it’s worth it in the end because once you get there you can move mountains” — steve jobs – former ceo of apple the snowflake is a wonder of nature appearing so simple and yet it is deceptively complex its unique shape is determined by the specific path it follows when falling through the sky no two are the same and the number of possible different shapes is infinite the symmetry of the snowflake has proven influential in the field of mathematics and fractal geometry similar to the snowflake we believe that solutions to complex investment challenges should be simple to understand and intuitive they should be founded upon
