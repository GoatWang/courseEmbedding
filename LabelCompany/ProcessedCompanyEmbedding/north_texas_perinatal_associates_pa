blood samplingintrauterine transfusion transvaginal mcdonald or shirodkar cerclage transabdominal cerclage amniocentesis high resolution targeted ultrasonography assessment of fetal well being preconception counseling chorionic villus sampling chorionic villus sampling cvs is a technique for obtaining genetic information about an unborn baby by collecting cells from the babys placenta indications for cvs include an increased risk for a baby with a chromosomal abnormality a family history of heritable genetic diseases or evidence of fetal abnormalities on a first trimester ultrasound increased nuchal translucency cvs has been available for decades and is as safe as amniocentesis when performed by an experienced physician cvs is considered to be associated with a pregnancy loss rate of  procedures and in our experience the loss rate has been less than  early studies of the safety of cvs raised concerns about a risk of injury to the developing baby that included loss of fingers more recent safety studies have shown that when the procedure is done after the tenth week of pregnancy and when done using modern equipment and techniques there is not a risk of fetal malformations cvs can be performed either through the abdominal and uterine walls transabdominal approach or through the vagina and cervix transcervical approach both are equally safe the safest procedure for any mother is the one that can be achieved with the most ease and the least manipulation factors including the location of the placenta will help determine the best approach for each patient we offer both transabdominal and transcervical cvs between   week and   weeks of pregnancy if you need to have a cvs for any reason we are happy to see you and to discuss the specifics of the procedure and the route that would be safest for you and your baby back to top percutaneous umbilical blood samplingintrauterine transfusion percutaneous umbilical blood sampling pubs and intrauterine transfusion iut are techniques used to sample the babys blood to evaluate and to treat specific fetal problems pubs involves using ultrasound to direct a needle through the mothers abdomen and uterus and into the vein in the babys umbilical cord to obtain a sample of the babys blood iut is done when the pubs shows that the baby has anemia low blood count and involves transfusing blood through the needle in the babys umbilical cord to treat the anemia while the baby is still in the uterus fortunately the need for either of these procedures is rare now as medical breakthroughs such as rhogam for preventing rh disease and middle cerebral artery mca doppler to assess for fetal anemia have been introduced because these procedures are required less often it is important to find providers who have experience in these procedures at ntpa we have a number of years performing these procedures and work diligently to keep up our skills to make the procedure as safe as possible for the mothers and babys who require it back to top transvaginal mcdonald or shirodkar cerclage whatsurgical treatment for cervical insufficiency or incompetence called cervical cerclage is generally performed utilizing a transvaginal approach during the  week of gestation the suture is placed around the upper cervix in a pursestring fashion thus reducing the likelihood of early dilatation and preterm delivery whytransvaginal cervical cerclage maybe suggested for women with a history of relatively painless premature cervical dilatation which has resulted in a secondtrimester pregnancy loss or women with a history of cervical surgery such as a leep letz or conebiopsy or women with a history of other cervical trauma such as dc laceration during a prior pregnancy or rapid delivery of a large infant or if prior pregnancy loss is due to an abnormally shaped uterus ie bicornuate uterus whenwhile most cervical cerclage procedures are performed at the end of the first trimester or early in the second trimester an emergent or rescue cervical cerclage may also be considered later in pregnancy if the amniotic sac begins to protrude through the cervix or if the cervix is noted to shorten during the second trimester does it workcervical cerclage success is best defined as a term pregnancy however relative success is a pregnancy progressing beyond the time of the prior loss and resulting in a living survivor cervical cerclage may prevent  of miscarriages or preterm delivery related to properly diagnosed cervical incompetence are their risks to surgerywhile any surgery carries risks a nonemergent elective cerclage is considered relatively low risk risks include but may not be limited to bleeding infection damage to the cervix or adjacent organs preterm premature rupture of membranes pptrom preterm labor cervical stenosis scar causing a permanent narrowing late pregnancy erosion of the stitch into adjacent organs anesthesia risks will vary depending on the method employed during surgery ie general epidural or spinal anesthesia back to top transabdominal cerclage women who have failed a vaginal mcdonald shirodkar or wurm cervical cerclage or women who have an amputated cervix little or no cervix available for vaginal cerclage may consider a transabdominal cerclage tac the tac is placed above the mothers bladder at the uterine isthmus lower uterus encircling the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments the tac may be placed laproscopically or is placed via an abdominal incision much like a csection incision and requires a cesarean section for delivery of the infant back to top amniocentesis amniocentesis is a procedure used to sample the fluid around the baby while it is still in the uterus this procedure is typically done after   weeks amniocentesis can be used to determine if the baby may have a problem with too many or too few chromosomes to determine if the baby may have contracted a viral or bacterial infection or later in the pregnancy to determine if the babys lungs are mature enough to deliver the baby amniocentesis involves placing a needle through the skin on the mothers abdomen and into the uterus and the fluid around the baby this is done under continuous ultrasound guidance and sterile conditions typically amniocentesis is performed in the doctors office the risk of an amniocentesis is the risk of pregnancy loss nationally this risk is quoted as one pregnancy loss for every  to  amniocenteses performed many studies have shown that the main key to safety in amniocentesis is having the amniocentesis done by someone who has performed lots of amniocenteses in our hands we find this to be a safe and useful procedure in situations where there are concerns about the baby and the results may help to manage the pregnancy back to top high resolution targeted ultrasonography a level ii ultrasound is not a d ultrasound but it is a more detailed ultrasound it is a targeted or diagnostic ultrasound as opposed to the more general screening level i ultrasound specific ultrasound findings must be documented in order to call an ultrasound level  versus level  your perinatal physician has specialty training and a broad experience in this type of ultrasound back to top assessment of fetal well being it is important to establish fetal wellbeing in a variety of clinical conditions in which perhaps it might threatened we establish fetal wellbeing in several ways the easiest and cheapest simply being maternal perception of fetal movement fetal heart rate variability ultrasound fetal movement and tone amniotic fluid levels and doppler flow studies of umbilical cord blood flow help your perinatal physician establish fetal wellbeing depending on the clinical situation we typically recommend these procedures weekly but recommendations may range from every other week to every day depending on our level of concern back to top preconception counseling npta will address the specific needs of each couple if there has been a previously complicated pregnancy due to preterm labor andor preterm delivery genetic disorders fetal anomalies or maternal conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure or recurrent pregnancy loss our maternalfetal medicine specialist andor genetic counselor will provide a specific outline of your future pregnancy care important lifestyle habits should include in addition to a wellbalanced diet taking a prenatal daily vitamin with folic acid prior to conception being physically active is of benefit eliminating smoking alcohol and illicit drugs and avoiding
