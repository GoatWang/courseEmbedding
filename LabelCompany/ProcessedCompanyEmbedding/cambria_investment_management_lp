i know which one is right for me” fortunately the answers are simple in order to meet the varying investing preferences of our clients we offer six unique trinity portfolios you might think of them as sitting along a continuum ranging from most conservative trinity  to most aggressive trinity  all six portfolios are similar in that they share the same foundational building blocks of our trinity strategy  assets diversified across a global investment set  tilts toward investments exhibiting value and momentum traits and  exposure to trend following the differences between the portfolios stem from how much of each building block you’ll find in each specific portfolio in other words what’s the specific asset mix in any given portfolio how much exposure to trend following is in any given portfolio the differences in our six trinity portfolios on the conservative end of our continuum trinity  you’ll find the asset mix dominated by bonds an asset that historically can be lessvolatile as to the second question above trinity  contains the least exposure to trend following and instead is more of a buyandhold portfolio investors who prefer trinity  are likely more conservative in nature focused less on maximizing returns and more on minimizing portfolio volatility on the aggressive end of our continuum trinity  you’ll find the asset mix dominated by stocks an asset that historically can be more volatile yet able to generate greater gains trinity  also contains the greatest exposure to trend following investors who prefer trinity  are likely more aggressive in nature preferring to target greater returns even though they may be accompanied by increased portfolio volatility trinity portfolios  –  fill in the continuum from conservative to aggressive the version we highlight in

levels  but the only way to realize a loss is to sell the asset that has experienced a loss however in a wellallocated portfolio each asset plays an essential role in providing a piece of total market

on assets – and how much and when to allocate them – are we missing the bigger picture our book begins by reviewing the historical performance record of popular assets like stocks bonds and cash we look at the impact inflation has on our money we then start to examine how diversification through combining assets in this case a simple stock and bond mix works to mitigate the extreme drawdowns of risky asset classes but we go beyond a limited stockbond portfolio to consider a more global allocation that also takes into account real assets we track  assets and their returns since  with particular attention to a number of wellknown portfolios like ray dalio’s all weather portfolio the endowment portfolio warren buffett’s suggestion and others and what we find is that with a few notable exceptions many of the allocations have similar exposures and yet while we are all busy paying close attention to our portfolio’s particular allocation of assets the greatest impact on our

later popularized this method with his version of the cyclically adjusted pricetoearnings cape ratio in the late s and correctly issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years we apply this valuation metric across more than  foreign markets and find it both practical and useful indeed we witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the united states we then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation buy now shareholder yield a better approach to dividend investing by meb faber shareholder yield a better approach to dividend investing shows stepbystep how to find returns in a low yield world investors have flocked to dividend stocks in search of yield however fewer companies are paying out less in dividends due to legal tax and structural changes in the us markets dividend payments are only one use of a company’s free cash flow other uses of cash include share repurchases debt paydown reinvestment in the business and mergers and acquisitions consequently investors in the st century must look to all of the direct and indirect ways in which companies distribute their cash to shareholders a metric commonly referred to as “shareholder yield” in this book we analyze portfolios based on the various cash flow metrics and find that portfolios of companies with high shareholder yields outperform both broad market indices and high dividend yield portfolios by a substantial margin with all of the uncertainty in the markets today shareholder yield helps the reader answer one of the most often asked question in investing today – “where do i find yield” buy now meb faber’s white papers a quantitative

original paper – to present a simple quantitative method that improves the riskadjusted returns across various asset classes – hold up since publication overall we find that the models have performed well in realtime achieving equity like returns with bond like volatility and drawdowns we also examine the effects of departures from the original system including adding more asset classes introducing various portfolio allocations and implementing alternative cash management strategies download relative strength strategies for investing the purpose of this paper is to present simple quantitative methods that improve riskadjusted returns for investing in us equity sectors and global asset class portfolios a relative strength model is tested on the frenchfama us equity sector data back to the s that results in increased absolute returns with equitylike risk the relative strength portfolios outperform the buy and hold benchmark in approximately  of all years and returns are persistent across time the addition of a trendfollowing parameter to dynamically hedge the portfolio decreases both volatility and drawdown the relative strength model is then tested across a portfolio of global asset classes with supporting results download global value building trading models with the  year cape over seventy years ago benjamin graham and david dodd proposed valuing securities with earnings smoothed across multiple years robert shiller popularized this method with his version of this cyclically adjusted pricetoearnings ratio cape in the late s and issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years we apply this valuation metric across over thirty foreign markets and find it both practical and useful and indeed witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the united states we then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios based on valuation and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation download where the black swans hide  the  best days myth below we examine market outliers in financial markets how much effect do these outliers have on long term performance can the investor prepare for these anomalies or are they truly ‘black swans’ that cannot be managed in this issue we examine numerous global financial markets on daily and monthly time frames we find that these rare outliers have a massive impact on returns however these outliers tend to cluster and the majority of both good and bad outliers occur once markets have already been declining we critique the “missing the bestdays” argument proffered by advocates of buy and hold investing demonstrating that a significant majority of the  best days and the  worst days occur in declining markets we continue to advocate that investors attempt to avoid declining markets where most of the volatility lies and conclude that market timing and risk management is indeed possible and beneficial to the investor download learning to love investment bubbles what if sir isaac newton had been a trendfollower investment manias and financial bubbles have likely existed for as long as humans have been involved in financial markets in this research piece we take a look at some of the more famous market bubbles in history and the extreme volatility and drawdowns they experienced we then examine a simple trendfollowing approach investors could use to manage their risk across twelve market bubbles we find that a trendfollowing system would have improved return while reducing volatility most importantly it would have reduced drawdowns significantly leading to the most important rule in all of investing – surviving to invest another day download finding yield in a  world many investors are surprised to learn that the largest asset class in the world is foreign debt us investors often allocate very little to foreign bonds and when they do it is through capitalization weighted indexes these indexes allocate the highest weighting to countries with the most debt outstanding is there a better way to invest in global bonds we examine a simple value approach applied to global sovereign bonds and find that it works well across decades in a world of very low and even negative yields a value approach could potentially add a well needed source of income to a diversified portfolio download learning to play offense and defense combining value and momentum from the bottom up and the top down sorting stocks based on value and momentum factors historically has led to outperformance over the broad us stock market however any longonly strategy is subject to similar volatility and drawdowns as the sp  drawdowns of  or even  make implementation of a stock strategy very challenging is there a way to add value on stock selection but also reduce volatility and drawdowns of a long only strategy with hedging techniques in this paper we examine the possibility of following a strategy that combines aggressive offense and smart defense to target outsized returns with manageable risk and drawdowns download what if  is really  pension funds investing with fingerscrossed and eyes closed it is well known that pension funds in the united states are underfunded even if they achieve their projected  rate of return the scope of pension underfunding increases to an astonishing level when more probable future rates are employed a reduction in the future rate of return from  to the more reasonable riskfree rate of approximately  causes the liabilities to explode by trillions of dollars as bond yields declined over the past twenty years pension funds moved toward more aggressive equitybased portfolios in an attempt to reach for this  return by investing in a portfolio with uncertain outcomes pension funds could experience increasingly volatile and even negative returns paradoxically in an effort to chase the universal  rate pension funds may be laying the groundwork for returns even lower than the risk free rate in an effort to offer an empirical basis for this possibility we conclude the paper with a relevant comparison – the return of a hypothetical japanese pension for the past two decades we believe that pension funds need to at least prepare for the unfathomable  returns for  years most pension funds regrettably have not adequately stress tested their portfolios for these scenarios download global cape model optimization we use the shiller cape model proposed by mebane faber as a template for the exploration of a variety of portfolio optimization methods by virtue of the model’s systematic allocation to the ‘cheapest’ markets with the highest theoretical risk premia the model has the potential to extract high costs from ‘behavioural taxes’ related to the model’s extreme volatility and drawdown character we apply several portfolio optimization techniques with the objective of maximizing portfolio sharpe ratios and minimizing drawdowns including dynamic volatility weighting risk parity target risk and minimum variance consistent with recent published research on robust portfolio optimization return to risk ratios improve broadly with the greatest impact achieved from procedures that manage positions andor portfolios to an ex ante target volatility a theoretical framework is also proposed download politics and profit combining the presidential cycle and the january effect does the intersection of two market anomalies set the stage for outsized performance the first is what is known as the presidential cycle this theory goes that equity returns during the third and fourth years of a president’s term are more favorable than the first two years a second market bias is the large outperformance of small cap stocks in january historically small caps outperformed large caps in  of all januaries by  percentage points per year historically across the  months in the four year cycle the january of year  is the single biggest outperformer with median returns since  of nearly  a month for small caps does this mean that january is guaranteed to be great again nothing is guaranteed – year  januaries have varied from  to down  while many of these tendencies are just that investors can view them as head or tailwinds that could give bulls and bears pause download videos featuring meb

in whole or in part on a cash basis and will be subject to a transaction fee  neither the trust nor any fund will be marketed or otherwise held out as a “mutual fund” instead each fund will be marketed as an “activelymanaged exchangetraded fund” any advertising material where features of obtaining buying or selling creation units are described or where there is reference to redeemability will prominently disclose that shares are not individually redeemable and that owners of shares may acquire shares from a fund and tender those shares for redemption to a fund in creation units only  the funds web site which will be publicly available prior to the public offering of shares will include the prospectus and additional quantitative information updated on a daily basis including on a per share basis for each fund the prior business days nav and the market closing price or midpoint of the bidask spread at the time of the calculation of such nav “bidask price” and a calculation of the premium or discount of the market closing price or bidask price against such nav on each business day before commencement of trading in shares on the stock exchange the fund will disclose on its web site the identities and quantities of the portfolio instruments held by the fund that will form the basis for the funds calculation of nav at the end of the business day applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act for an exemption from sections a a d and e of the act and rule c under the act under sections c and b of the act for an exemption from sections a and a of the act and under section dj of the act for an exemption from sections da and b of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provisions of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because shares will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit the trust and any fund to register as an openend management investment company and redeem shares in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase shares in creation units from each fund and redeem creation units from each fund applicants further state that because the market price of creation units will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities investors should be able to sell shares in the secondary market at prices that do not vary materially from their nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in the prospectus and not at a price based on nav thus purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will not comply with section d of the act and rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions to permit shares to trade at negotiated prices  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been designed to a prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers resulting from sales at different prices and c assure an orderly distribution system of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from brokers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that a secondary market trading in shares does not involve the funds as parties and cannot result in dilution of an investment in shares and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because arbitrage activity should ensure that the differences between the market price of shares and their nav remain immaterial section e of the act  section e of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption applicants observe that settlement of redemptions of creation units of global funds is contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the us securities markets but also on the delivery cycles present in foreign markets in which those funds invest applicants have been advised that under certain circumstances the delivery cycles for transferring portfolio instruments to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules will require a delivery process of up to  calendar days applicants therefore request relief from section e in order to provide payment or satisfaction of redemptions within the maximum number of calendar days required for such payment or satisfaction in the principal local markets where transactions in the portfolio instruments of each global fund customarily clear and settle but in all cases no later than  calendar days following the tender of a creation unit with respect to future funds that are global funds applicants seek the same relief from section e only to the extent that circumstances exist similar to those described in the application  applicants submit that congress adopted section e to prevent unreasonable undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds applicants state that allowing redemption payments for creation units of a fund to be made within a maximum of  calendar days will not lead to unreasonable undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the redemption process and would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section e applicants state the statement of additional information “sai” will disclose those local holidays over the period of at least one year following the date of the sai if any that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days and the maximum number of days up to  calendar days needed to deliver the proceeds for each affected global fund except as disclosed in the sai for a fund deliveries of redemption proceeds for global funds are expected to be made within seven days applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to global funds that do not effect creations or redemptions inkind section d of the act  section da of the act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring securities of an investment company if the securities represent more than  of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company or together with the securities of any other investment companies more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company section db of the act prohibits a registered openend investment company its principal underwriter or any other broker or dealer from selling its shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired companys voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the acquired companys voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally  applicants request relief to permit investing funds as defined below to acquire shares in excess of the limits in section dla of the act and to permit the funds their principal underwriters and any brokers to sell shares to investing funds in excess of the limits in section dlb of the act applicants submit that the proposed conditions to the requested relief are designed to address the concerns underlying the limits in section d which include concerns about undue influence excessive layering of fees and overly complex structures  applicants submit that their proposed conditions address the concerns regarding the potential for undue influence to limit the control that an investing fund may have over a fund applicants propose a condition prohibiting the adviser of an investing management company “investing fund advisor” sponsor of an investing trust “sponsor” any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the investing fund advisor or sponsor and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections cl or c of the act that is advised or sponsored by the investing fund advisor the sponsor or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the investing fund advisor or sponsor “investing funds advisory group” from controlling individually or in the aggregate a fund within the meaning of section a of the act the same prohibition would apply to any subadviser to an investing management company “investing fund subadviser” any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the investing fund subadviser and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections cl or c of the act or portion of such investment company or issuer advised or sponsored by the investing fund subadviser or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the investing fund subadviser “investing funds subadvisory group”  applicants propose a condition to ensure that no investing fund or investing fund affiliate  except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to a fund will cause a fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities during the existence of an underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an underwriting affiliate “affiliated underwriting” an “underwriting affiliate” is a principal underwriter in any underwriting or selling syndicate that is an officer director member of an advisory board investing fund advisor investing fund subadviser employee or sponsor of the investing fund or a person of which any such officer director member of an advisory board investing fund advisor or investing fund subadviser employee or sponsor is an affiliated person an underwriting affiliate does not include any person whose relationship to the fund is covered by section f of the act  applicants propose several conditions to address the concerns regarding layering of fees and expenses applicants note that the board of directors or trustees of any investing management company including a majority of the directors or trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the act “disinterested directors or trustees” will be required to find that the advisory fees charged under the contract are based on services provided that will be in addition to rather than duplicative of services provided under the advisory contract of any fund in which the investing management company may invest in addition an investing fund advisor trustee of an investing trust “trustee” or sponsor as applicable will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the investing fund in an amount at least equal to any compensation including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a fund under rule b under the act received from a fund by the investing fund advisor trustee or sponsor or an affiliated person of the investing fund advisor trustee or sponsor other than any advisory fees paid to the investing fund advisor trustee or sponsor or its affiliated person by a fund in connection with the investment by the investing fund in the fund applicants also propose a condition to prevent any sales charges or service fees on shares of an investing fund from exceeding the limits applicable to a fund of funds set forth in nasd conduct rule   applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure applicants note that a fund will be prohibited from acquiring securities of any investment company or company relying on sections c or c of the act in excess of the limits contained in section da of the act except to the extent permitted by exemptive relief from the commission permitting the fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for shortterm cash management purposes  to ensure that the investing funds understand and comply with the terms and conditions of the requested order any investing fund that intends to invest in a fund in reliance on the requested order will be required to enter into a participation agreement “fof participation agreement” with the fund the fof participation agreement will include an acknowledgment from the investing fund that it may rely on the order only to invest in the funds and not in any other investment company sections a and  of the act  section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person “second tier affiliate” from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company section a of the act defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person and any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a of the act defines “control” as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company and provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns more than  of another persons voting securities each fund may be deemed to be controlled by an adviser and hence affiliated persons of each other in addition the funds may be deemed to be under common control with any other registered investment company or series thereof advised by an adviser an “affiliated fund”  applicants request an exemption under sections c and b of the act from sections a and a of the act to permit inkind purchases and redemptions of creation units by persons that are affiliated persons or second tier affiliates of the funds solely by virtue of one or more of the following a holding  or more or in excess of  of the outstanding shares of one or more funds b having an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in a or c holding  or more or more than  of the shares of one or more affiliated funds applicants also request an exemption in order to permit a fund to sell its shares to and purchase its shares from an investing fund and to engage in any accompanying inkind transactions with certain investing funds of which the funds are affiliated persons or a secondtier affiliates  applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting such affiliated persons from making inkind purchases or inkind redemptions of shares of a fund in creation units both the deposit procedures for inkind purchases of creation units and the redemption procedures for inkind redemptions will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions regardless of size or number absent the circumstances discussed in section iea of the application on each business day the deposit instruments and redemption instruments available for a fund will be the same for all purchasers and redeemers respectively and will correspond pro rata to the funds portfolio instruments applicants state that the method of valuing portfolio instruments held by a fund is the same as that used for calculating the value of inkind purchases or redemptions and therefore creates no opportunity for affiliated persons or the applicants to effect a transaction detrimental to other holders of shares of that fund applicants note that any consideration paid for the purchase or redemption of shares directly from a fund including for any affiliated person and including any investing fund will be based on the nav of the fund in accordance with policies and procedures set forth in the funds registration statement applicants do not believe that inkind purchases and redemptions will result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching of the fund  applicants also submit that the sale of shares to and redemption of shares from an investing fund meets the standards for relief under sections b and c of the act applicants also state that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the act and appropriate in the public interest applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions a
