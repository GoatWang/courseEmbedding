rudolph  rupert neve home  reviews  barry rudolph barry rudolph the audio artistry of rupert neve is fully realized in the portico ii channel strip which features his unique thinking on circuit design in its miclinedi input eq vcabased compressor and output sections the singlechannel tworackspace portico has a sturdy steel case with a thick aluminum front panel all pushbuttons have led lighting with multicolor led gain reduction and output meters interior construction is excellent a motien dctodc converter supplies phantom power additionally the unit has a large toroidal output transformer and fieldreplaceable circuit board subassemblies in what seems to be a tribute to vintage nevedesigned console channel strips like the  the portico ii’s switches and pots are mounted on a steel subframe that mechanically isolates them from the front panel input section microphone line or direct source inputs are coupled through a custom input transformer the mic input uses neve’s “transformerlikeamplifier” topology and has a kohm nonreactive input resistance that is said to load lowoutput mics in a nondetrimental manner there are also front panel inch di and thru input jacks for the megohm discrete fet input circuit input gain is controlled from  to  db in db steps by a position rotary switch and fine adjustments are made by a ±db pot pushbuttons are provided for phase polarity mute and phantom onoff and a signalpresent led glows green for db levels and higher and red at  dbu last is a  to hz dboctave active bessel highpass filter that’s switchable from the main signal path to the compressor sidechain the back panel also sports jacks for the sidechain sendreturns and stereo linking equalizer the band equalizer ±db each has a pair of fully parametric midrange lmf and hmf sections and lfhf shelvingpeak filters the lf and hf filters have four frequency choices each here designer neve has reused the “accelerated slope” design found in his  and  modules for the hflf filters the lmf and hmf bands have continuously variable q from  to  and a  to k hz range for the lmf and  to k hz for hmf there are inout buttons for each of the hf and lf sections and a single switch for both the lmf and hmf in what could be a design first the deesser circuit is built into the hmf section where only that section’s audio is reduced in response to an “s” instead of the entire audio band via the unit’s compressor section and rather than simply hijacking the eq’s hmf section for deessing it’s possible to boostcut and deess at the same time deess amount is controlled by a separate pot and the q and frequency choices that you make in the hmf are also used by the deesser’s opto limiter compressor among the compressor’s distinctive and useful features are the blend control which mixes the amount of compressed signal with the original while a fffb button offers a choice between either a modern feedforward compressor style or feedback style that is common in vintage compressors a prepost button instantly jumps the eq’s position in the signal chain to either before or after the compressor the silk mode emphasizes low frequencies while silk emphasizes high frequencies a texture control for the silk and silk modes adds saturation to the output transformer by reducing the amplifier’s negative feedback the compressor uses a that corp vca chip with  to  ratios a dbu to dbu threshold  to ms attack times ms to second release times and up to  db of makeup gain an rmspeak button switches between rms and peak detection with rms used below  hz and peak on higher frequencies in ii the channel the ability to have a mic line and direct input always connected and ready to go is a big plus for me the mic pre handles up to  dbu and can function as a second line input without a pad the unit’s lighted buttons are excellent in dimly lit control rooms as are the positivefeeling rotary switches and the tactilely reassuring centerdetent eq boostcut controls the led meters although compact are bright and easy to read from across the room my first check was running audio through the portico ii without any processing channel strips have no bypass so i carefully matched levels and the monitoring volumes of a source going into the portico and coming out at the same time drums vocals bass and guitars all sounded bigger and richer simply by passing through the portico ii the mic preamp compares favorably to a vintage neve module on vocals using a neumann u the differences were nil as compared with a vintage  with the eq switched out on the portico ii hum and noise levels were lower and the dynamic range was much higher than the plusyearold  percussive sources sounded warmer in the low frequencies yet very open in the highs the di was immaculately clean and fat sounding my fender strat sounded exactly like it should its passive pickups were not loaded down and there is plenty of gain if you want to drive the portico ii’s compressor hard routing the highpass filter to the compressor sidechain prevented unwanted gain reductions from inadvertent palm thumps when switching from a mic source to the di i liked not having to call up another io channel in pro tools the eq prepost button is extremely useful especially for heavy processing if you are looking to both brighten and squash a snare changing the eq’s position to postcompressor will compensate for losing attack brilliance which is caused by compression with fast attack times without the hassle of changing patch cords i could make a “prepost” check when searching for a sound the fffb button is like having two compressors in one feedforward is the mode best used for more aggressive control obvious compressor effects or for harder and more insistent sounds and at about the same compression settings fb had a vintage smooth sound when i wanted dynamic modification that was less strictly enforced—more compression with fewer artifacts as i would expect in fb mode vocals were rounder and taller using up more space in the mix when using ff the same vocal track became harder more present and undeniable sounding combinations of fffb and rmspeak modes make the compressor extremely versatile in ff mode—at the same threshold setting as in fb—the rms mode allowed louder attacks and deeper gain reductions on percussive sources like kicks snares and tambourines selecting peak in fb mode seems to speed attack times slightly by attacking more often but it caused less lf compression the peak detector mode was best for “peak stop”–type limiting for program mixes pedalsteel guitar or loud singers with no mic technique the blend knob is a great way to dial in the exact amount of overall dynamic control no matter how much you squash being able to add back the original sound to taste—all in phase—is an excellent feature the equalizer is great for everything from subtle touchups on full tracks and keyboards to shaping individual guitar tracks to fit into huge “wire choir” stacks the q range is perfectly designed for extreme carving of poorly recorded tracks and subtly polishing an already greatsounding vocal track when used in moderation the deesser was gentle and generally all i needed for most wellrecorded vocal tracks with few sibilance problems because the deesser is a dynamic eq it also works for deemphasizing a band of frequencies you can somewhat reduce peaky vocal or acoustic guitar resonances or loud hihat leakage on a snare drum track with minimal collateral sonic damage finally silk and silk are two cherries on top silk works well to warm up any thinsounding instrument track—a kind of lowfrequency boost—while silk is a very highfrequency glossy effect useful for dulledout heavily compressed sounds modern rupert neve sound the portico ii channel offers the epitome of the rupert neve sound in a unit that is superflexible and powerful yet simple to use the neve legacy lives on with this combination of his timeproven circuit topologies and newly designed processors for these modern times vienna business directory restaurants contractors shopping and savings local services vienna va business
