mentalism penguinlive tweet click to enlarge “as a rationalist and a mechanist i view all phenomena as ultimately explainable ‘there’s no such thing as magic’ is one of my common refrains but some observations may seem to contradict all past experience that’s what makes science so interesting and it’s why kopf’s performance was especially delightful to watch i saw it a month ago and have been puzzling over it ever since kopf is a consummate artist and i hope to understand one day how he was able to do what he did” dr bruce beutler nobel laureate “jared kopf is a name one often hears whispered among magical cognoscenti a protégé of bob white his sleightofhand skills are outstanding and he is a serious student of the art focusing like his teacher on what may be considered the vernon tradition” magic magazine “he’s one of the best card guys out there right now    you’re going to love his work professional on every level” dan buck what will he teach sleights how to improve everything from your pinky break and double lift to your top palm and blind shufﬂe “shufﬂe sht”  a table multiple shift that will put even the most observant spectator to sleep thoughts on the “pushthrough shufﬂe” the “flops i know” blind cut by john wilson and jared kopf and its applications to stack work and whatever else comes to mind card magic  gambling routines the copenhagen card a version of hofzinser’s “everywhere and nowhere” with a strange presentation and fooling method utilizing sleights from the classic books of magic as well as from the gaming table an open display of triumph a version of vernon’s classic that will fool lay audiences and experts alike this method mirror’s the original from stars of magic but there is no blind shufﬂe merlin’s lost ace trick the classic knucklebuster from expert card technique is taught in its original form along with a few presentational touches on the equivoke sequence on marlo’s onerifﬂe runup a gambling demonstration in which the pseudocardshark shows how the four aces can be stacked for any number of hands with only one riffle shuffle mentalism a simple game a version of the whichhand game with three objects and three participants three people each select an object of their own free will but the mentalist proves that he controlled their choices from the beginning rifﬂe oosoom a new setup for dai vernon’s classic mental card effect “out of sight out of mind” threecard will a version of the socalled free will plot with a shufﬂed deck of cards set list is subject to change who is he jared kopf writes a

review pro privacy on login to see reviewer names on december th  while the material explored in this lecture is surely comprehensive and valuable for any card magician jared kopf needs to learn how to teach what he knows in a manner that is clear and structured without rambling from one thought to the next there were so many segues from one though to the next that the original idea of the effect was lost in the long and arduous explanation of the moves after an hour of watching and waiting for an explanation of the first thing he did i forgot entirely what he was talking about although his demonstrations of technique was excellent the multiple and often annoying jump to another thought was distracting and left this observer filled with lots of moves without substance suggestion to jared…do one thing and then explain the method if you chose you will be a better teacher as you have lots of knowledge that can be more readily shared with the proper presentation  of  magicians found this helpful did this review help you do you want to respond to this review disappointing report this review verified buyer pro privacy on login to see reviewer names on december th  i think its only my attitude but i disliked that lecture cause i thought its more gambling than it actually was and his teaching style is not that great the material covered is mainly basic stuff and hes not going in much detail on the push through although its announced for beginners its probably good but for the others not that you are probably better with jason england or joe barry  of  magicians found this helpful did this review help you do you want to respond to this review not focus report this review verified buyer pro privacy on login to see reviewer names on june nd  too much side talk and not focus on the main point of the trick i can tell that he truly thought and spent lots of times developing his presentations and that is probably why he has a lot of information to share  thank you but no thank you the lecture was not a total waste of time but just not well presented to engage the attendees dan had to steer him back on track and make explained jared points a few times three stars

this lecture is no exception mr kopf is a link to the great masters such miller vernon and marlo he has an understanding of conjuring technique and psychology that is difficult to contend with as well
