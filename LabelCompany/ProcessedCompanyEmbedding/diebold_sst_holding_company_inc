stack  to an exit end of said apparatus for delivery of said stack  to a customer description technical fieldthe present invention relates to a statement presenter mechanism which is particularly useful in an automated teller machine atm specifically the apparatus of the present invention is directed to a simple yet reliable mechanism for presenting any one of a number of different sized bank statements receipts or other documents which are presented individually or in stacks in the event a customer fails to take the statements after they have been presented the apparatus may retract the statements back into the automated teller machine and deposit it in a storage bin or other container background artautomated teller machines are known in the prior art banking customers may access their accounts using a magnetically encoded card generally the customer will insert their card into the machine which will correlate the identifying information encoded on the card with a personal identification number provided by the customer this verifies the customers identity to the computer system which operates the machine thereafter the customer may typically use the atm to conduct banking transactions as well as to check the status of various accounts that they have with the financial institution when all of the transactions and inquiries are completed the customer will receive his card back from the machine along with one or more receipts documenting the transactions performed as more people conduct their banking transactions electronically using atms there is a desire to provide the customer with more information customers often want information about their accounts including what checks have cleared andor what other deductions andor charges may have been applied customers may also wish to obtain information about other services provided by the bank such as investments retirement accounts or the terms available for various types of loans it is usually not possible to print much information on a receipt that is provided by an atm this is because such receipts are typically fairly small in size to provide all the information that customers want in a legible format larger sheets are needed in addition information about some accounts such as checking accounts may be so extensive that even if large sheets are provided multiple sheets will be required the customer may wish to receive their entire checking account statement for the month or perhaps several months from the automated teller machine most atms that are presently in use are not capable of printing or delivering the type of sheets that are necessary for providing detailed customer statements nor are existing atms capable of delivering stacks of multiple statement sheets further adding to the difficulty associated with providing detailed statement information from atms is that different institutions often desire to print different types of statements these statements have different physical dimensions as a result any mechanism that is made for stacking and delivering statements to a customer from an atm would have to be made to suit the particular size of statement that the bank wanted to deliver this increases complexity and cost another problem with statements presented by atms is that a customer who has conducted a banking transaction will often forget to take their receipt or perhaps does not want the receipt if so the receipt will generally remain protruding from the face of the machine and sometimes the next person to use the machine will pull out the old receipt and throw it away passersby or other users will also look at the receipt out of curiosity if the receipt contains confidential information regarding accounts such as checking accounts this could present undesirable security risks regardless of whether the document contains confidential information an untaken receipt becomes a nuisance and a potential source of litter this is undesirable as it will tend to clutter the area of the automated teller machine making it unattractive and undesirable for customers united states patent no  discloses a document registration apparatus that includes a plurality of laterally spaced registration stops which pivot about a horizontal axis for stopping motion of documents and registering the leading edge of documents to a particular direction in the apparatus the apparatus also includes at least one pinch roller cooperatively operating with conveying structure for moving the registered documents away from the apparatus for further processing japanese patent application no  discloses apparatus into which a single sheet may be inserted a shutter is provided to prevent a sheet from being skewed and jamming and sensors are installed to determine whether an inserted sheet is straight when a sheet which a user is trying to insert is not properly aligned the apparatus may output a voice announcement instructing the user to straighten or move the sheet thus there exists a need for an apparatus and method that enables a customer to receive a plurality of statements detailing the status of different accounts and transactions from an atm and which avoids disclosure of the information and minimizes litter in the event the customer fails to take their statements in accordance with an aspect of the invention there is provided paper presentation apparatus for an automated teller machine the apparatus comprising a movable first belt a first axle and a second axle disposed from said first axle said first belt being supported by said first and second axles a movable second belt extending generally parallel of said first belt a paper stop and a mechanism interconnecting said paper stop and said first

customer using an atm a preferred embodiment of the invention provides a statement presenter apparatus incorporated into an atm the apparatus receives statements that have been printed on paper that has been taken from a storage bin within the machine and passed to a printer for printing information related to a customers transactions or accounts the statement paper presenter receives the documents and stacks them the stack may then be presented to the customer by the apparatus if the documents are not taken by the customer within a predetermined time they can be returned through the apparatus and held within the machine a preferred embodiment of the invention can place the papers to be delivered to the customer on to a lower conveyor belt which can move the papers and stacks them the papers can be stacked substantially flush against the paper stop once the printing of statements has been completed and all of the documents collected against the stop the paper stop will preferably move upward while an upper belt moves downward the paper can then be moved by frictional engagement between the upper and lower belts by cooperative movement of the belts in a preferred embodiment a sensor enables the belt to push a portion of the stack of papers through an exit slot in the fascia of the automated teller machine after a predetermined time if the papers have not been removed by the customer from the machine the belts can operate in the reverse direction and move the papers back into the machine this rearward movement of the papers eventually causes them to engage a diverter plate and be routed into a storage bin embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying figures in whichfigure  is a perspective

paper stop in a downward positionfigure  is a left side view of the mechanism showing the gear train for driving the upper belts of the apparatus referring now to the drawings and particularly to figure  there is shown therein a preferred embodiment of the invention generally indicated  the preferred embodiment of the invention receives paper that has been pulled from a storage bin within an automated teller machine by rollers or a comparable mechanism associated with a printer the printer prints information desired by a customer on the paper the paper is either precut or is preferably cut to size by a mechanism associated with the printer after the paper exits the printer it is received by the statement presenter which either delivers the papers to the customer or if a customer fails to take the statements retracts them into the machine where they are stored until removed by a technician a preferred embodiment of statement presenter is shown in figure  for simplicity the main paper path is further illustrated by the partially sectioned side views in figures     and  as shown in figures  and  a statement paper  which has exited a printer mechanism and has been cut to length is pulled by a set of rollers  which ride on lower belts  the rollers pull the paper into the apparatus as the paper begins to exit the rollers a flapper mechanism  provides rotational contact against the paper using flexible arms  the flexible arms  urge the paper to continue its movement away from the rollers and to continue into contact with the moving lower belt which moves in the direction of arrow a as shown in figure  as later explained upper belts  move in coordination with the lower belts and further help to guide the paper into position the paper moves on the lower belts until the leading edge of the paper abuttingly contacts a paper stop  the paper stop  has fingers  that extend transversely downward between the lower belts generally the lower belts will continue moving for a few moments after the paper has engaged the fingers of the stop thereby assuring that the paper has reached the stop once this has occurred the belts will stop until the next paper if any arrives from the printer a motor  see figures  and  drives the belts of the present invention in a manner later discussed in detail a sensor  monitors the paper entering the apparatus the sensor  which is preferably a photo eye or similar device is used to assure that the paper has been properly cut the sensor also controls the movement of the lower belts thus when the sensor senses paper coming into the paper presenter the lower belts are driven to carry the paper forward to the paper stop likewise once the sensor determines that the trailing end of the paper has passed the sensor the lower belts run for an additional time deemed necessary to carry the paper to the paper stop and then the lower belts are turned off this is done under the control of a processor schematically indicated  which is appropriately programmed to drive the lower belts in accordance with the signals received from the sensor if the sensor does not detect the trailing edge of the paper within a time calculated by the processor it is known that the paper has not been cut or there is another problem the processor then generates a signal indicating a fault condition and further operation of the mechanism is avoided in an alternative embodiment an automated mechanism can be connected to the sensor  wherein the sensor enables the processor to calculate the length of the paper entering the paper presenter and the mechanism adjusts the paper stop to accommodate the particular paper size however because in most embodiments only a single size of paper will be presented at one time a manually adjustable paper stop is used in the preferred embodiment paper stop  is preferably comprised of relatively hard and resilient material it is adjustable and can be slid along guide supports  and  to accommodate different lengths of paper the resilient character of the paper stop provides for holding the stop on the supports once it has been placed in the desired position preferably the paper stop is positioned so that the end of the paper is able to exit rollers  and be held in place by the action of the arms of the flapper mechanism  if the paper stop is set too far forward the papers will not be in proper position for the flapper mechanism to work properly and may not allow the paper to pass from the rollers  resulting in paper jams additional papers that come from the printer pass on top of the stack of papers supported on the lower belts of the mechanism in similar fashion the flapper mechanism reduces paper jamming and will generally cause the papers to become neatly stacked one on top of the other a platen  which extends on the sides of the lower belts further helps to support the stack once all of the desired papers have been printed and stacked upon the lower belts with their edges against the paper stop a signal is sent by the processor this signal controls a drive mechanism which causes the paper stop to move upwardly away from the paper the paper stop is moved on a paper stop frame assembly  upon which are mounted the guide supports  and  as illustrated in figures  and  as the paper stop moves upwardly away from the stack an upper belt assembly simultaneously moves down and engages the top of the paper or the top paper in the stack of papers the top and bottom belts are then started and move at the same speed in substantial cooperation to move the stack outward to an exit slot  figures  and  through  further illustrate the mechanism which raises the paper stop  while lowering the upper belts  and vice versa as best shown in figures   and  a rigid dogleg shaped arm  has a slotted rear portion  in which is journalled a back axle  of the upper drive belts a middle pivot point of arm  is movable about a fixed shaft  the fixed shaft  extends across the entire housing and is preferably secured at each end to the housing  as shown in figure  arm  further includes a slotted front portion  which accepts a connector pin  pin  extends from a front arm  and connects arm  thereto the back arm  and front arm  are interconnected to the paper stop  via connector pins  and  which are attached to the paper stop frame assembly  the connector pins  and  are enabled to move vertically in slots  which extend through the walls of the housing similarly the front arm  has a forward portion  in which a front axle  of the upper belts  is journalled front arm  pivots about a fixed shaft  which is preferably fixed to housing  and extends across the entire housing in a manner similar to shaft  see figures   and  the forward portion of back arm  overlaps with the rearward portion of the front arm  this overlapping section of contains the pin  which provides a pivoting connection arm  is preferably slotted so as to enable the movement of pin  therein hence as pin  moves upwardly the paper stop  moves upwardly due to the resulting upward movement of pins  and  simultaneously the front and rear axles  and  of the upper belts move downward due to the rotation of the arms about shafts  and  the axles  and  of the upper belts are enabled to move in the housing  in vertical slots  as shown in figures   and  the frame assembly  also has slots  in the walls thereof as shown in figures  and  the shafts  and  which extend across the housing extend through slots  and enable the frame assembly to move thereon in guided relation the upward and downward movement of the paper stop and upper belt assembly is controlled by a rack and pinion gear train which is best shown in figures   and  a gear member  is positioned on the left side of the housing the gear member is preferably integrally formed with a front arm having a forward portion similar in shape to arm  previously discussed the gear teeth on the gear member  engage a pinion  as the pinion rotates clockwise as shown in figures  and  the gear member rotates counter clockwise raising the paper stop and lowering the upper belt conversely as the pinion moves counterclockwise the gear member moves clockwise lowering the paper stop and raising the upper belt hence the paper stop and the upper belt are interconnected in a way that causes each to move in the opposite direction this is controlled by the direction and amount of rotation of the pinion the pinion  is driven by a drive motor  which is positioned opposite motor  on the frame further as shown in figures  and  a rear arm  which is a mirror image of arm  is positioned on the left side of the housing and engages a pin  on the gear member in a slotted fashion similar to arm  the drive mechanism for the belts is best shown with reference to figures   and  as shown in figure  motor  drives a belt  which in turn drives a pulley  the shaft of motor  also has a hand wheel  attached thereto which facilitates manual rotation of the motor this is useful in clearing paper jams pulley  is connected to a shaft  which drives the lower belts shaft  extends through the housing to the left hand side as shown in figures  and  shaft  drives a gear  on the left hand side of the housing gear  is connected to a gear  which in turn drives a shaft  rollers  are mounted on shaft  and are driven thereby gear  drives another gear  gear  is a floating gear which is mounted on a link  which is rotatably movable about shaft  gear  in turn drives another gear  which is mounted on a link  link  is rotatable about the axis of gear  gear  drives front axle  of the upper belt as a result axle  is enabled to move up and down in slot  while being continuously driven by motor  as will be understood by those skilled in the art axles  and  may include appropriate bushings thereon so as to enable them to move up and down in slots  without sustaining significant frictional losses in operation once the printed papers are collected against the paper stop  motor  operates to rotate gear member  counterclockwise this raises the paper stop and lowers the upper belts motor  is then started so that the upper and lower belts cooperatively move the stack forward thereby moving the stack of papers toward the exit slot  an exit sensor  which is preferably a photo eye or similar device senses when the front edge of the papers have passed through the exit slot as the atm is designed so that the papers in this position are extending through an opening in the machine and are accessible by the customer the processor  which operates the machine causes motor  to turn off thereafter motor  turns on so as to raise the upper belts the customer is then free to remove the stack from the machine in the event that exit sensor  does not sense the removal of the stack within a preset time the processor controlling the operation of the machine will cause motor  to operate again lowering the upper belts motor  is then operated in the reverse direction so that the stack is drawn back between the belts and moved towards rollers  in the direction indicated by figure  as the stack approaches rollers  the stack engages a flexible diverter plate  rollers  extend through cutouts in diverter plate  to engage belts  diverter plate  guides the paper below the plate and into a storage bin  where the papers will be held until removed by a technician hence when paper enters the presenter the paper moves over the diverter plate and on to the lower belt however when the paper is moved in the opposite direction towards rollers  it engages the flexible diverter plate and passes below it so that it can be diverted into the bin of course in alternative embodiments of the invention the paper may instead of being held may be carried out of the bin by sets of rollers or by other mechanical means to a location where it may be periodically removed by a service technician this ensures that the customers confidential account information is not available to unauthorized persons who might otherwise find it as litter near the atm it should further be pointed out that while the presenter mechanism is preferably operated so as to stack papers and then present the stack to the customer it may alternatively be operated to present statements to a customer one at a time in the manner traditionally done by atm machines in this mode of operation the statement presenter is operated with the upper belts engaged with the lower belts as a result when a paper passes into the device from the printer it is immediately carried between the belts to the exit end to be taken by the customer depending on the nature and speed at which the statements are received from the printer it may be alternatively possible to selectively position the paper stop so that the papers are enabled to ride below the paper stop on the lower belt flights  without direct engagement with the upper belt flights  in this manner the papers are simply carried unobstructed in a oneatatime manner to the customer this may be advantageous when the operation of the atm involves the delivery of only a single document and where it is undesirable to take the time associated with raising and lowering the upper belt flights the statement presenter mechanism may be readily adjusted to accommodate various paper sizes the paper length may be changed by simply moving the paper stop  along the guide supports  and  to the desired position further the mechanism is made so that the width of the paper may be varied

this invention relates to a device for identifying the denomination and authenticity of currency notes background artnumerous devices have been previously developed for identifying documents and determining their authenticity document us  us    and wo  describe examples of such devices likewise devices have been previously developed for determining the denomination and authenticity of bank and currency notes such devices commonly test different properties of a presented note and based on the properties sensed give an indication of the denomination andor authenticity of the presented note all such prior art devices have limitations many prior art devices require precise alignment of the note during sensing of its properties this requires the device to include a mechanism to align the notes and often limits the speed at which the notes can be processed in addition some devices require that presented notes be oriented in a particular way as they are sensed this limits their usefulness as notes are often not presented in a uniform orientation many prior art devices for determining note denomination and validity are capable of processing only a small number of note types this presents drawbacks as other note types cannot be processed such prior art devices are also generally made to be used with only one type of currency such as the currency of a particular country often it is difficult or impossible to adapt such devices to handle currencies of countries which have different physical properties furthermore it may be difficult to adapt such devices to a new printing series of notes within the same country many prior art devices are also amenable to compromise by counterfeit notes it is becoming easier to produce highly accurate counterfeit reproductions of currency by mimicking the properties of a note that are tested by prior art currency denominators and validaters it is often possible to have counterfeit notes accepted to minimize the risk of acceptance of counterfeits the range of the acceptance criteria in prior art devices can often be set more closely however currency notes in circulation change properties through use fairly quickly notes in circulation may change their properties through handling and wear notes may become dirty or marked with ink or other substances notes may also lose their color due to having been mistakenly washed with clothing or exposed to water or sunlight prior art currency denominators and validaters may reject valid notes which exhibit such properties when the criteria for acceptance is set too tightly note denominators and validaters currently available may also be difficult to program and calibrate such devices particularly if they must have the capability of handling more than one type of note may require significant effort to set up and program in addition such devices may require initial calibration and frequent periodic recalibration and adjustment to maintain a suitable level of accuracy prior art note denominators and validaters particularly those having greater capabilities often occupy significant physical space this limits where they may be installed in addition such devices also often have a relatively high cost which limits their suitability for particular uses and applications thus there exists a need for a currency note denominator and validater which is more accurate has greater capabilities is faster smaller in size and lower in cost disclosure of inventionaspects of the invention are defined in the accompanying claims according to an embodiment of the

circuit can be operable to actuate each of the emitters in each spot sensing assembly in a sequence in accordance with one form of the invention the sequence all of the emitters of the same type produce radiation simultaneously while all of the other types of emitters are off alternatively the sequence may provide for emitters in the spot sensing assemblies to be turned on at different times however in one embodiment only one emitter in each spot sensing assembly is  active at any one time while the sensors are being read the emitters can be activated in the sequence continuously the emitters can be sequenced numerous times as the note in the transport passes adjacent to the spot sensing assemblies as a result three sets of test spots can be arranged in a line are sensed on each passing note for each test spot the first detector which senses reflection can produce a first signal responsive to each emitter each first signal can be representative of the amount of radiation reflected from the test spot from a corresponding emitter likewise the second detector can produce second signals responsive to the amount of light transmitted through the test spot on the note from each emitter the circuit can be operative to receive the first and second signals from the first and second detectors respectively and to generate reflectance and transmission values in response thereto for each test spot four reflectance and four transmission values can be generated likewise for each row of three test spots which are checked on the note simultaneously by the three spot sensing assemblies twelve reflectance values and twelve transmission values can be generated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention generally about  rows of test spots can be sensed as the note moves past the spot sensing assemblies this can result in the circuit generating about  reflective values and  transmission values per note the values in the data store can correspond to reflectance and transmission values for a number of note types in various orientations and spatial positions the circuit can be operative to generate stored value sets from the values in the data store stored value sets can be generated based on the angle of skew of the note which is detected as it passes the sensing assemblies numerous stored value sets can be generated by the circuit each corresponding to a particular note denomination note orientation and note position the circuit can be operative to calculate values representative of the levels of correlation between the sensed value set of reflectance and transmission values for the note and each of the stored value sets by comparing the level of correlation between the sensed value set and the stored value sets a highest correlation value can be determined the highest level of correlation will be with a stored value set that corresponds to the particular denomination and orientation of the note which passed through the transport to produce the sensed value set the circuit can be operative to generate a signal indicative of the note type it identifies in accordance with an embodiment of the invention the circuit can be operative to compare the highest correlation value with a set threshold value even worn notes and those that have been subject to abuse exhibit a relatively high level of correlation with a stored value set for the correct note type if however the level of correlation is not above the set threshold then the note may not be identifiable or it may he a counterfeit or it may be identified and determined to be unfit for reuse the circuit can generate signals indicative of these conditions brier description of the drawings figure  is a schematic of a preferred embodiment of the apparatus

note and three transversely disposed spot sensing assemblies which correspond to the data graphically shown in figure  best modes for carrying out inventionreferring now to the drawings and particularly to figure  there is shown therein a preferred embodiment of an apparatus of the present invention generally indicated  the apparatus includes a note transport  transport  is preferably a belttype transport that moves sheets such as currency notes one at a time from an entry end  to an exit end  sheets such as notes move on the transport  in a note direction indicated by arrow a the apparatus of the present invention also includes a plurality of spot sensing assemblies  the preferred form of the invention includes three spot sensing assemblies which are spaced from one another in a direction transverse of the note direction of note movement see figure  each of the spot sensing assemblies includes a reflectance detector schematically indicated  each spot sensing assembly  also includes a transmission detector schematically indicated  as indicated in figure  the reflectance detector  is in operative connection with and outputs first signals to a control circuit schematically indicated  the transmission detectors  are also in operative connection with the control circuit  and the transmission detectors output second signals thereto control circuit  is also in operative connection with a data store schematically indicated  which holds stored values in a manner later explained the apparatus of the present invention may in certain embodiments also include auxiliary validation sensors schematically indicated  the auxiliary sensors  preferably detect properties of passing notes that are not detected by the spot sensing assemblies these auxiliary sensors may include for example magnetic type sensors or sensors for sensing identification strips on passing notes or sheets the auxiliary sensors  do not form part of the present invention and are not further discussed herein it will be understood however that many types of auxiliary sensors may be used in connection with the present invention and the signals output by such sensors are processed and analyzed in the control circuit  through appropriate electronic components the spot sensing assemblies  are shown in greater detail in figures  and  each spot sensing assembly includes a reflectance detector  which in the preferred form of the invention includes a photocell the reflectance detectors  are positioned on a first side of a passing note  which is shown in phantom in figure  the transport  moves note  past the spot sensing assemblies each spot sensing assembly  includes four emitters  the emitters  are positioned generally adjacent to and in surrounding relation of each reflectance detector  each spot sensing assembly includes emitters with wavelengths which generally span the visible range of light and infrared in the described embodiment each spot sensing assembly includes a blue emitter a green emitter a red emitter and an infrared emitter in the preferred form of the invention the emitters are light emitting diodes leds which are selectively operable to produce generally monochromatic light at a particular wavelength in other embodiments of the invention other types and wavelengths of emitters may be used each emitter  in a spot sensing assembly is oriented so as to direct and focus radiation onto a test spot schematically indicated  which is shown on the adjacent surface of a passing note in the preferred form of the invention because there are three spot sensing assemblies properties of the note are sampled simultaneously at three test spots  which are transversely spaced across the bill as best shown in figure  radiation from the emitters  is reflected from each test spot  to the reflectance sensor  of the spot sensing assembly the reflected light is passed through a lens  adjacent to each reflectance detector to further focus the reflected light thereon radiation from the emitters  also passes through each test spot on the test note the transmitted radiation passes to the transmission detector  of each of the spot sensing assemblies  in the preferred form of the invention each of the transmission detectors  includes a photocell as a result when reflectance detector  senses radiation from one of the emitters reflected from the test note transmission detector  simultaneously senses radiation transmitted through the test note from the same emitter in the preferred form of the invention the control circuit  is operable to selectively actuate each of the emitters  the control circuit actuates each type emitter in each spot sensing assembly individually so that only one emitter in a spot sensing assembly is producing radiation at any time in one embodiment the control circuit  is operative to activate the same type emitter in each of the spot sensing assemblies  simultaneously for example all the blue emitters in each of the spot sensing assemblies are activated to produce radiation at the same time thereafter all the blue emitters go off and all the green emitters in each of the spot sensing assemblies come on thereafter the green emitters go off and the red emitters come on when the red emitters go off the infrared emitters come on the infrared emitters go off and the sequence repeats alternatively the emitters may be activated in a marquee style so that the particular type emitter in each assembly is on for a time before it is read and emitters of the same type are read at different times this approach has the advantage that it enables the emitters to stabilize before being read by the controller of course the sequence of emitters may be different in other embodiments the emitters radiate individually and in sequence rapidly such that each emitter comes on one time for each test spot  the test spots preferably are discrete and each of the emitters direct light onto generally the same spot on the note during one sequence despite the fact that the note is moving as those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing description each reflectance detector  produces four first signals for each test spot  the four first signals are produced responsive to radiation from the blue green red and infrared emitters respectively similarly each transmission detector  produces four second signals for each test spot  there is one second signal for the radiation transmitted through the test spot from each of the four emitters in the spot sensing assembly the control circuit  receives each of these first signals and is operative to generate a reflectance value responsive to each signal representative of the magnitude of light reflected by the note  from each of the emitters likewise the control circuit  is operative to generate transmission values responsive to each of the four second signals from transmission detector  each of the transmission values are representative of transmitted light through the test spot from each emitter because there are three spot sensing assemblies  spaced transversely across the note the first circuit is operative to generate  reflectance values and  transmission values for each row of  test spots  on the note in the preferred form of the invention the control circuit  is operative to actuate the emitters in the spot sensing assemblies very rapidly this is done so the test spotsare maintained discrete and compact a number of test spots are preferably sensed as a note moves past the three spot sensing assemblies  in the transport in the preferred form of the invention the spot sensing assemblies are actuated so that each spot sensing assembly senses about  test spots on a standard us currency note this means that generally  x    test spots are sensed on the average note because  transmission and  reflectance values are generated per test spot  x    about  data values per note are gathered the transport  is preferably moved in such a speed that  standard us currency notes per second are moved past the spot sensing assemblies of course in other embodiments different numbers of test spots data values and note speeds may be used a fundamental advantage of the present invention is that the emitters produce radiation which spans the visible range of light as well as infrared this provides signals which test the validity of the note at a number of different wavelengths in both the transmission and reflectance modes this enables the gathering of much more data concerning the note image and material properties than prior types of note denominators and validaters a further fundamental advantage of the present invention is that it is capable of identifying many types of notes in different orientations as later explained the preferred form of the present invention does not require that the notes be precisely aligned either in the note direction or transversely in the note path as schematically represented in figure  a note which is delivered to the present invention for identification and validation may be one of many types the preferred form of the invention is configured to identify  different denominations of notes of course other embodiments of the invention may analyze different numbers of note denominations however in the preferred form of the present invention there is no requirement that the notes delivered be oriented a particular way therefore notes may be delivered face up face down as well as with the top of the note leading or with the bottom of the note leading to identify the note as a particular type the present invention must be able to handle notes delivered in all four orientations in figure  a sensed value set  representative of a set of data sensed from the test note is shown as previously discussed in the preferred embodiment this sensed value set will generally include a set that is  by  this is because each row of three test spots generates  values  reflectance and  transmission and there are generally  rows of test spots on the note the right side of figure  shows stored value sets  in the preferred form of the invention the stored value sets are produced by the control circuit  the sensed value set  generated from the note is compared for correlation with each of the stored value sets  in figure   stored value sets are shown this is representative of the  note denominations multiplied by four possible orientations for each note type as will be later explained in detail in the preferred form of the invention there are many more than  stored value sets to which the sensed value set is compared this is because the apparatus must determine not only the particular note type  from among  possible note types and orientations but must also determine the note type even though the note position may be shifted either in the direction in which the note is transported or transverse to the note direction or may be skewed relative to the direction of transport the process by which the control circuit calculates the values representation of the level of correlation between the sensed valued set which is representative of the reflectance and transmission values from the sensed note and the stored value sets is schematically represented in figure  for purposes of the correlation calculation carried out by the control circuit  the sensed value set  is considered to be x data the data values in the stored value set indicated  are considered to be y data the level of correlation is calculated in accordance with the equation cxy∑xiμx⁢yiμyσx⁢σy where cxyis the correlation coefficientxiis the sensed value from the sensed value set datayiis the corresponding value in the stored value setµxis the average of the values in the portion of the sensed value set being correlatedµyis the average of the values in the corresponding portion of the stored value set being correlatedσxis the standard deviation of the sensed values in the portion of the sensed value set being correlatedσyis the standard deviation in the corresponding portion of the stored value set as will be appreciated the greater the correlation coefficient the higher the level of correlation between the sensed value set and the stored value set being compared a high value is indicative that the stored value set corresponds to the particular type test note that generates the data in the sensed value set turning now to figure  there is schematically shown a sensed value set  from a note that is moved past spot sensing assemblies  as shown in the upper portion of figure  sensed value set  is a matrix that is  by  the lower portion of figure  shows a similarly sized stored value set  which is generated by circuit  from data in the data store  in a manner later explained in the preferred form of the invention each set comprising the three columns of x values representing one color and mode in sensed value set  is checked for correlation with corresponding values in the three columns of stored value set  a correlation coefficient is calculated for the values in each triple column set the correlation coefficients for each of the  triple column sets are then multiplied together by the control circuit to obtain an overall correlation value indicative of a level of correlation between the sensed value set and the stored value set in one form of the invention the correlation coefficient values for reflectance mode values are first multiplied together to obtain an overall correlation value for reflectance thereafter the same is done for all correlation coefficient values for transmission mode values to obtain an overall value for transmission these overall values are then multiplied together to calculate a final value indicative of correlation of the stored value set and the test note calculating the transmission and reflectance values separately has the advantage that the individual values can be analyzed individually by the control circuit in accordance with its programming this may be preferred in some embodiments for example high correlation for overall reflectance but not transmission may be indicative of some quality of the note that may warrant taking it out of circulation other embodiments may combine correlation values in other ways such as by wavelength or radiation the combination of correlation values for analysis may differ in other embodiments depending on the notes and properties of interest the present invention because the stored value sets generated are arranged in matrices can analyze certain physical areas on notes in detail through programming of the control circuit thus in embodiments of the invention the manner in which sensed and stored value sets are generated and correlation values calculated may be tailored to note properties and areas of interest the particular type of note passing through the apparatus of the invention is generally indicated by the stored value set having the highest overall level of correlation with the sensed value set this stored value set corresponds to one note type for example a particular note denomination in a particular orientation once the control circuit determines the stored value set with the highest level of correlation it then indicates the particular type of note that it has determined the passing note to be by generating a signal indicative thereof in some embodiments it is also desirable to point out situations where the passing note has a relatively low level of correlation with all of the possible note types this may be indicative of a counterfeit note a foreign note or currency that is unacceptable for reuse due to tears dirt wear or extraneous markings the control circuit  is operable to provide an indication not only of the identity of the note type which best correlates with the sensed value set but also to indicate when the calculated highest level of correlation is below a set threshold which suggests a counterfeit or unacceptable note alternatively the control circuit of the apparatus of the present invention may be configured to include several set thresholds for correlation these may correspond to notes which are suspect as counterfeit or severely damaged and notes which merely exhibit signs of wear age or abuse which make them unacceptable for return to circulation because the preferred form of the present invention provides data which accurately identifies notes by denomination despite wear dirt and extraneous markings it is possible to make such judgments concerning the quality of a note as well as to identify its type the present invention also provides data which may be used advantageously specifically for counterfeit detection purposes the ability of the invention to test both transmission and reflectance across a broad spectrum of radiation and to compare sensed data to stored values for proper notes enables the setting of thresholds for particular wavelengths of radiation some wavelengths of radiation may provide data more indicative than others of counterfeit or unacceptable notes this is particularly true in countries which have currency notes that include different color schemes for different denominations the control circuit of the present invention may be programmed to abstract and analyze particular abstracted correlation data for this purpose while in the embodiment of the invention previously described correlation coefficients are calculated for sets which correspond to  columns of data and these correlation coefficients are then combined other embodiments may use sets comprised of other portions of the sensed data for purposes of calculating the correlation coefficients these correlation coefficients may then be combined to produce a final value indicative of correlation with the stored value data for example correlation values may be calculated between each column or line of sensed data and stored data these correlation values may then be combined alternatively correlation values based on  columns associated with each mode transmission  reflectance may be calculated and then the  values combined alternatively a single correlation value for all data in the sensed and stored value sets may be calculated the approach of calculating correlation coefficients for  columns of data and then combining them as described has been found to work well for us currency however for other types of notes or documents or for other forms of sensing hardware other approaches to calculating correlation coefficients and then combining them may also be found to work well in indicating the identity of the test note or document referring again to figure  it should be noted that in the embodiment of the invention shown that generally the first four rows of sensed data and generally the last three rows of such data are not correlated with the stored value sets when the bill is transversely aligned in the note path generally the calculation of the level of correlation is made between sensed value sets and stored value sets comprising  rows and  columns as later explained the first four rows of data sensed from the note and the last at least three rows are generally used to calculate whether the note is skewed in the transverse direction of the bill path as well as to confirm that the note is the proper length if the note is skewed the control circuit generates stored value sets by selecting values from the data store which are correspondingly transposed to correspond to the calculated angle of skew further as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art if a note is longer than a proper note such that it produces data for more test spots than it should it is identified as a suspect or counterfeit note by the control circuit and is rejected or treated accordingly in the preferred embodiment of the invention notes passing the spot sensing assemblies on the transport need not be aligned either in the note direction or in a transverse direction to be identified to achieve this the data store includes data for all of the identifiable note types at a much closer spacing than the spacing between test spots detected by the spot sensing assemblies as a note passes in the preferred form of the invention the data is collected and stored for increments that are onefourth the spacing between the test spots on a note passing in the transport of course in other embodiments of the invention other increments may be used in figure  a sensed value set  is schematically represented a first template  is representative of a particular type of note denomination that passes in centered relation relative to the  spot sensing assemblies in the transport as a result it is indicated in figure  as having a  offset the values shown in first template  are the  transmission and reflectance values for a note of a particular type at increments onefourth the distance between the test spots on a passing note thus in the preferred embodiment first template  would be a matrix of  by  x   values stored value sets for comparison to a sensed value set are derived from template  by the control circuit by taking the values in every fourth line from the template in other words the data in lines     and so on correspond to a note in a particular position relative to the direction a note moves in the transport similarly lines     and so on correspond to the same type of note in another position relative to the note direction from the template  the control circuit generates stored value sets corresponding to the particular note type to which template  corresponds in varied positions relative to the note transport direction in figure  second template  corresponds to the same note type as note  second template  however has reflectance and transmission values for test spots on the note offset a transverse increment from the test spots which produced the values in first template  by taking every fourth line of values from template  the control circuit generates stored value sets for the particular type of note transversely offset from the centered position and in various positions relative to the direction of note transport third template  shown in figure  corresponds to the same type of note as templates  and  template  contains values corresponding to test spots on the note shifted transversely from the zero offset position in an opposed direction from template  third template  is also a matrix of  by  values stored value sets are produced therefrom by the control circuit by abstracting every fourth line of values in the preferred embodiment of the invention templates are provided for test spots at several transversely offset positions this enables notes to be disposed from the centerline of the note path as well to have a leading edge that is not aligned with any reference and still be identified the process of inputting the data necessary to produce the templates is accomplished in the preferred embodiment during a set up mode of the apparatus in the set up mode stored value data is generated by positioning a note of each type in the transport data is gathered by each spot sensing assembly from  lines of test spots instead of the  lines which is the usual number for a sensed note this can be accomplished by static positioning of the note or alternatively by moving the note at a speed which enables the spot sensing assemblies to be sequenced sufficient times to gather the data for storage in the data store during the set up mode the notes are sensed while centered in the transport path as well as disposed transversely from the centered or zero offset position so that the templates for notes that are transversely offset in increments are generated and stored the ability to set up the device by using actual currency and passing it through the transport enables set up of forms of the apparatus in a rapid and reliable fashion this is desirable where this data must be gathered for twenty notes each of which has four orientations and several offset positions in one embodiment of the invention templates are produced for four offset positions in each transverse direction from the zero offset position these templates are offset in increments of oneeighth of an inch this means that a note passing through the transport may be positioned within one half inch in either transverse direction of the zero offset position and still be accurately identified in other embodiments of the invention it is feasible to gather andor compute the stored values experimentally and store them in templates in the data store alternatively such templates may be produced in a separate machine and then loaded into the data store of the apparatus provided the data is accurately gathered the apparatus will properly indicate the type of note sensed the process by which the apparatus of the present invention calculates a level of correlation and determines the identity of a note is schematically represented in figure  it should be understood that in the operation of apparatus  the control circuit  actuates the emitters of each of the spot sensing assemblies  in the sequence on a continuing basis a note can arrive at any point during the sequence as the note moves adjacent to and then passes the three spot sensing assemblies  the control circuit gathers the data at a step  the data gathered is arranged in memory as a matrix of values that is generally  by  this raw data is represented by matrix  matrix  may actually contain more values if the note is skewed however for purposes of this initial example a  by  matrix will be assumed which corresponds with a nonskewed note as represented by  by  submatrix  the first four rows of data from the note are used by the control circuit to calculate a skew angle at a step  in a manner hereinafter discussed further as represented by the  by  submatrix  control circuit  is operable to calculate the note length at a step  in doing this the control circuit considers the skew angle because the spot sensing assemblies will sense more than  rows of test spots on a note if the note is skewed at step  the length of the note is determined based on the number of test spots from which data is received and the skew angle the note length is compared to a stored value indicative of the number of test spots for a standard note length and if the note is too long or too short control circuit  generates a signal indicative of the condition sensed assuming for purposes of this example that the note is the correct length and transversely aligned with respect to the note path the control circuit  is operative at a step  to generate stored value sets the stored value sets are generated from templates  the nine templates  shown are each a matrix of  columns by  rows the nine templates  comprise a master template  which corresponds to a note type one note denomination in a particular orientation each of the nine templates  correspond to the note type in each of nine transverse positions in the note path the  rows of data in each template  represent the transmission and reflectance values in increments onefourth the distance between test spots on a sensed note that is passed through the transport in the embodiment of the invention described the nine  by  templates  comprise the master template  which includes all the stored values corresponding to one note type because the preferred form of the invention is configured to identify twenty notes in four orientations there are eighty master templates in the data store in this preferred embodiment each of the master templates is comprised of nine templates like templates  this means that in this preferred embodiment the data store holds  x    templates each template having  x    data values for a total of  x    stored values in the data store of course in other embodiments other template arrangements may be used the control circuit  is operative in the example shown to produce fortyfive stored value sets  from the templates  in each master template  these fortyfive stored value sets are shown in a table in figure  these stored value sets  are generated by the control circuit by taking every fourth line from each of the templates  the control circuit preferably does this starting with the sixteenth line in each of the templates  this is done because as previously discussed the first four rows of data taken from the note are used to calculate skew angle and are generally not used in generating the stored value sets  if the note is not skewed fortyfive stored value sets  are generated for each of the eighty templates  as can be appreciated from the foregoing discussion with the first four rows of test spots being discarded the first row of test spots on the note from which the data would be used for correlation purposes in this example would be the fifth row of test spots this corresponds to the  x  twentieth line in each template  thus the control circuit takes the twentieth line and every fourth line thereafter until  rows of data are read to generate a  by  stored value set  stored value sets produced in this manner correspond to the zero vertical position in the table in figure  however because the note sensed may be shifted forward in the note path from the zero position the control circuit  is operative to generate stored value sets  that are likewise shifted forward in the note direction this is done by starting with the nineteenth line in each template  and taking every fourth line thereafter until  values are gathered this corresponds a shift forward one increment stored value sets generated in this manner are the  stored value sets  shown in figure  likewise stored value sets shifted two increments forward are generated starting with the eighteenth line of data in each of the templates  and taking every fourth line thereafter this corresponds to the  stored value sets  shown in the table in figure  as can be appreciated stored value sets are also generated starting with the seventeenth line in each template  these correspond to the  stored value sets  stored value sets starting with the sixteenth line correspond to the  stored value sets  in the table in figure  the note may also be shifted rearwards from the zero vertical position as a result stored value sets  are produced starting with the twentyfirst twentysecond twentythird and twentyfourth values in each of the templates  these correspond to the    and  vertical position stored value sets respectively shown in figure  stored value sets  are further generated for transverse offset positions as shown in figure  stored value sets are produced for transverse offset positions of     and  the  symbol is used herein with transverse offsets to represent approximately  cm it should be noted that both vertical and transverse offsets are indicated in similarly evenly spaced increments and that other similarly spaced increments in english or metric units may be used thus the  stored value sets  represent reflectance and transmission values for one note type shifted forward and backwards in the direction the note moves in the transport as well as in both transverse directions while the master templates  consist of nine transverse subtemplates  in the preferred form of the invention stored value sets  are only produced for five transverse positions of the note rather than nine this is because the transport of the preferred embodiment and the manner in which the notes are delivered generally maintain the notes within  of the zero offset position for this reason in the preferred embodiment it is not necessary to produce additional stored value sets however in alternative embodiments where the transverse position of the note may be further disposed from the zero offset position additional stored value sets may be generated by the control circuit and used for correlation with the sensed value sets  referring again to figure  the matrix of raw values  from a test note that is sensed undergoes a vertical deskewing step  performed by the control circuit  when the note is sensed as skewed as later explained when the note is not skewed as in this example step  has no effect on the raw data in the present example a sensed value set  which is a  by  matrix is produced by the control circuit  directly from the raw data the control circuit  is then operative to calculate the level of correlation between the sensed value set  and each of the stored value sets  in the manner discussed with reference to figure  each of the correlation values is calculated and temporarily stored by the control circuit which storage is represented by table  from all the correlation values calculated for each master template one value will generally be the highest of course there are eighty master templates and the control circuit is operative to find the highest level of correlation among the fortyfive values for each of the  master templates this is represented by a step  in figure  the control circuit is then operative at a step  to provide an indication of the identity of the note type that produced the highest correlation value and therefore most closely correlates with the sensed value set from the note that passed through the apparatus as previously discussed embodiments of the invention also have stored in connection with the control circuit a threshold value which the highest level of correlation calculated must exceed before a note is considered genuine if the highest level of correlation for all the stored value sets does not exceed this threshold level then the note is suspect and potentially a counterfeit suspect notes of this type may be returned to a customer or held within the apparatus in a designated location this is done by using a divert mechanism that transports notes to the designated location alternative embodiments of the invention may also be used to segregate notes that are considered in good condition from those that exhibit wear abuse or soiled conditions this is accomplished by having stored in connection with the control circuit  a further threshold value for correlation which is above the threshold for note genuineness but below that for notes in suitable condition such an intermediate threshold may be used for purposes of segregating bank notes that while still good are sufficiently worn or soiled such that they should be removed from circulation a further advantage of the present invention is that it may provide an indication of note type that includes note orientation this enables the present invention to be coupled with mechanisms which reorient the note and segregate notes of different denominations this enables the notes to be collected for bundling or for dispense to a user of the machine in which the apparatus of the present invention is installed the present invention also provides capabilities for detecting counterfeit notes this is achieved because the available data may be selectively processed by the control circuit in ways that are intended to assist in the detection of counterfeit notes if for example it is known that counterfeit currency for a particular country tends to deviate significantly from actual currency either in reflection or transmission of a particular wavelength of radiation or in a particular region of a note the level of correlation for this particular wavelength or region of the note may be analyzed by the control circuit individually notes which exhibit the properties of a counterfeit may then be identified as suspect even through the overall level of correlation may be marginally acceptable the particular properties which may distinguish a counterfeit note from a genuine note will depend on a particular currency or other document involved and its properties a further advantage of the preferred embodiment of the present invention is that notes passing through the apparatus need not be aligned transversely in the note path rather the notes may be skewed such that one of the transverse sides is ahead of the other an example of a note  that is skewed relative to the note path is shown schematically in figure  note  is shown with its left side leading lines  which are superimposed on the note in figure  show the lines or grid of test spots that would be sampled if the note were aligned in the note path lines  represent the lines of test spots on the skewed note that are tested by the spot sensing assemblies superimposed lines  represent where the spot sensing assemblies sense data therefore the intersections of lines  and  represent a grid of locations where data is gathered by the spot sensing assemblies as the note  passes a sensed value set  shown in figure  shows the matrix of raw data that is generated as note  passes the spot sensing assemblies the spot sensing assembly that is positioned toward the left in figure  begins sensing data from the note before the spot sensing assembly in the center further the spot sensing assembly in the center begins sensing data before the spot sensing assembly on the right the spot sensing assemblies that do not sense the note sense a near zero reflectance value and a large transmission value similarly at the trailing portion of the note which is shown by the bottom of the raw sensed value set  the spot sensing assemblies stop sensing the note at different times in a manner that is essentially a mirror image of the condition at the leading edge of the note as can be appreciated from figure  because of the skewed character of the note the spot sensing assemblies sense data for more than  of the transverse lines  it will be recalled that  rows of test spots were sensed in the prior example for a nonskewed note to analyze this data the control circuit  of the apparatus of the present invention is operable to modify the raw sensed value set data  represented in figure  so that it is similar to other sensed value sets for transversely aligned notes the control circuit  of the invention is further operative to produce stored value sets which account for the angle of skew of the note when a note is skewed the control circuit  is first operative to modify the raw sensed value set  by transposing the data to eliminate the data points near the leading edge that represent the absence of a note this involves shifting the values on the right for each type of emitter as shown in figure  upwardly so that a sensed value set is created in which the sensed note data is present in each position in the  rows such a modified sensed value set is indicated  in figure  as shown in figure  by shifting the raw values a sensed value set which is a matrix of  by  sensed values is produced although the data was gathered from more than  of the transverse lines  when the bill was sensed the modified sensed value set  squares up the sensed data so that it is a similar sensed value set to a transversely aligned note such squared up data is usable by the control circuit for purposes of checking to see if the note sensed is the proper length if after squaring up the raw data the data does not correspond to the length of a proper note an appropriate indication of a suspect note is given as can be appreciated from figure  the modification of raw sensed value set  to create sensed value set  does not result in a matrix of values that can be readily correlated with templates for notes that are aligned in the note path this is because the test spots on skewed note  progressively move closer to the right edge of the note as the note passes the rate at which the test spots on the note migrate toward the right is a function of the skew angle to enable correlation of the modified sensed value set  with stored value sets the control circuit  is operable to generate stored value sets for correlation that account for the angle of skew this is graphically represented in figure  figure  shows a modified sensed value set schematically indicated  this modified sensed value set  for purposes of this example can be envisioned as corresponding to a note like that in figure  where the note is skewed such that the left side in the frame of reference leads the right side the control circuit is operable based on the calculated angle of skew of the note to take values from different subtemplates  in the master template  as graphically represented in figure  as shown on the right in figure  the values in columns   and  represent the templates similar to subtemplates  for a  horizontal offset  horizontal offset and  horizontal offset respectively as shown in figure  to generate a stored value set for correlation with modified sensed value set  the control circuit  is operative to select a series of values from the  offset template represented by column  the control circuit is then operative to jump so as to begin selecting values from column  which corresponds to the template  for the same note type transposed   from the  offset position further after taking several values from column  the control circuit is operative to begin selecting values from column  which is representative of the template for the same note type disposed  from the  offset position the point where the control circuit  begins selecting values from the different templates is determined by the angle of skew stored value sets are generated for all positions of the note disposed within  of the zero reference in the note path in a similar manner as can be appreciated from the graphic representation in figure  to generate stored value sets that encompass the possible positions for a skewed note the control circuit must abstract values from templates  for notes that are disposed more than  away from the zero offset position as can now be appreciated from figure  this is why there are additional transverse offset templates  in each master template  even though the note is generally confined to an area plus or minus  from the zero  offset position in the note path the calculation of the skew angle which determines how the control circuit selects or abstracts values from the various templates to produce the stored value sets is explained with reference to figures  and  figure  shows a note  which is skewed in a manner similar to note  in figure  note  has a left side leading a rightside in a direction of note travel indicated by arrow a a spot sensing assembly  is positioned to the left as shown in figure  a spot sensing assembly  is positioned to the right as shown in figure  both of the spot sensing assemblies are the same and similar to spot sensing assemblies  previously discussed line  in figure  is representative of the reflectance values for a first emitter type to have produced radiation which is reflected from note  in an amount above a set threshold  this threshold is indicated as  percent in figure  which has been found through experimentation to be an acceptable value for this purpose when using us currency notes of course other threshold values may be used data points  are representative of the actual reflectance values for the particular type emitter in spot sensing assembly  which was the first of the emitters to produce a reflectance value above the threshold line  is produced by a curve fitting process carried out by control circuit  using actual data points  this is done through execution of known curve fitting algorithms line  is fitted by the control circuit to data points  data points  are representative of the actual reflectance values from the emitter type in spot sensing assembly  that corresponds to the emitter that produced data points  in spot sensing assembly  by comparing the times at which the lines  and  each crossed the threshold  the skew angle of the note may be calculated this difference in time in which reflectance values for the same emitter type in each of the spot sensing assemblies crossed the threshold is represented by the quantity δt in figure  the distance between spot sensing assemblies  and  is a known fixed quantity similarly the speed at which the note moves on the note transport is also known as shown in figure  the angle of skew θ can be calculated by the following equation tanθν⁢δ⁢tx where θis the angle of skewvis the velocity of the note in the note directionδtis the difference in time between when the first emitter in a first spot sensing assembly senses the property of the note crossing the threshold and when the corresponding emitter in the furthest disposed spot sensing assembly senses the property for that assembly crossing the thresholdxis the distance between the spot sensing assemblies   for which the time difference is evaluated as can be appreciated from the foregoing discussion the angle of skew determines the points at which the control circuit begins selecting values from the templates to produce the stored value sets for comparison to the modified sensed value set of course the angle of skew may be in either direction which necessitates that the control circuit be enabled to abstract values from templates  progressively in either transverse offset direction referring again to figure  which shows the correlation sequence step  is the deskewing step in which the raw sensed value set from the spot sensing assemblies like set  in figure  is squared up to produce a modified sensed value set similar to set  in figure  when the data is skewed this step is done to produce the sensed value set  in figure  for purposes of correlation in step  the stored value sets are produced by the control circuit by abstracting data from the templates  in each master template  responsive to the skew angle detected thus in the example represented in figure  values are abstracted from the  offset template  and the  offset template  to generate the stored value set  in the table of stored value sets the  vertical and  horizontal offset position as will be appreciated from the prior discussion for the stored value sets  shown in the table above the  position shifts between the two adjacent templates  occur one line of data higher with each  step upward in the table of stored value sets similarly the shift between the templates would occur one data line downward for each   increment below the  vertical offset position in the table of stored value sets for example to generate the stored value set  shown in the table having a  vertical offset and a horizontal offset position of  values on the corresponding lines highlighted in figure  in the  horizontal offset template would instead be taken from the template having a horizontal offset of  likewise the lines shown highlighted in figure  in the  horizontal offset template would instead be taken from the  horizontal offset template similarly lines of data would be abstracted from these two templates by the control circuit  one data line upward from the values used to produce the   stored value set to generate the stored value set shown in the table at   abstracting values from the templates two data lines upward from the values used to generate the   stored value set provides the   stored value set and so on similarly abstracting values from the two templates used to produce the   stored value set  provides the       and   stored value sets this is done by abstracting values successively one data line lower than those abstracted to produce the prior stored value set likewise to produce the stored value set  in the  vertical offset  horizontal offset position the control circuit  abstracts values from the  and  horizontal offset templates  and so on it can be appreciated that the selection process executed by the control circuit  to generate the stored value sets for comparison with the sensed value set  can be visualized as a matter of shifting leftright among the templates  and up and down within the templates  to produce the various stored value sets  shown in the table positions in figure  it should be remembered however that even though values are abstracted or selected to produce the stored valued sets  all the selected values in a stored value set come from a single master template  which corresponds to a single note denomination having a particular orientation as a result when the values indicating levels of correlation are calculated and the highest one is found the stored value set which produced this highest level of correlation will correspond to only one type identity the control circuit  of the preferred embodiment is schematically represented in figure  the control circuit  includes an optical sensors and electronics component  the optical sensors and electronics component includes the spot sensing assemblies  which produce the first and second signals which cause the control circuit  to generate the reflectance and transmission values the control circuit further includes a scanning control subassembly  which is in connection with the optical sensors and electronics component  the scanning control subassembly  actuates the emitters in the sequence to produce the synchronized first and second signals which correspond to each emitter type a multiplexer and analog to digital ad converter component  is operative to receive the first and second signals from the spot sensing assemblies and to produce the raw reflectance and transmission values and to direct them to generate the sensed value set for each sensed note the control circuit  further includes an auxiliary sensors subassembly  the auxiliary sensors subassembly corresponds to the auxiliary sensors  previously discussed these auxiliary sensors are preferably a type particularly tailored to the document or note type being sensed a module controller  is operative to receive data from and to control the operation of the other components of the system the controller  is in connection with an angle encoder subassembly  the angle encoder subassembly  is operative to determine the skew angle of a note from the initial emitter signals as the note is sensed in the manner previously discussed the control circuit  further includes a communications subassembly  which is operative to transmit signals to and from the controller  the communications subassembly transmits information to and from a larger system of which the apparatus is a part it also delivers signals to and from input and output devices the controller  is in communication with a plurality of calculator modules  each calculator module  includes a digital signal processor  each digital signal processor  is in operative connection with a static random access memory  the memories  hold the stored values which are used to determine the level of correlation between the sensed value set and the generated stored value sets each memory  preferably holds a different group of the master templates  each calculator module  further includes a calculator controller  the calculator controllers are operative to produce the stored value sets from the templates in the memories  this is done based on angle of skew data provided by the controller  the calculator controllers are further operative to cause their associated digital signal processor to calculate the correlation values between the data values in the sensed value set and the stored value sets the calculator controllers are further operative to control the associated digital signal processor to calculate the overall correlation coefficient for each stored value set and to indicate the highest correlation value for the master templates handled by the particular calculator module the architecture of the preferred form of the control circuit  enables rapidly carrying out large numbers of calculations which are necessary to generate the stored value sets and to determine the correlation values for the sensed value set and all the stored value sets the control circuit  has the advantage that each of the digital signal processors operates in parallel on the master templates stored in its associated memory in addition the processing capabilities of control circuit  may be increased by adding additional calculator and modules  to generate and correlate additional stored value sets this enables correlating selective or additional sensed values with stored data in operation of the control circuit  the controller  operates the scanning control subassembly  to sequence the emitters in the spot sensing assemblies which are included in the optical sensors and electronics subassembly  the first and second signals corresponding to reflectance and transmission from each emitter are delivered to the multiplexer and ad converter  which delivers digital reflectance and transmission values corresponding to each emitter the multiplexer and ad converter  also receives signals from the auxiliary sensors and electronics subassembly  and delivers appropriate signals from these to the controller  as well the controller  is operable to sense a note entering into proximity with the spot sensing assemblies and to produce the raw sensed value set the angle encoder subassembly  is operative to determine the angle of skew from the raw sensed value set and to deliver the information to the controller  the controller  is further operative to modify the raw sensed value set and to deliver the modified sensed value set and the angle of skew data to each of the calculator modules  the controller  is operative to determine the note length from the modified sensed value set and compare it to the length for a standard note based on the number of test spots obtained if the sensed note does not have the proper length a signal indicative thereof is generated and further processing for that note is not conducted each calculator module  is operative to generate stored value sets from the stored values in the master templates in memories  based on the angle of skew the calculator modules are further operative to calculate the correlation coefficient values for the modified sensed value set and each of the generated stored value sets each calculator module stores and communicates to the controller  the calculated overall correlation coefficient value for each of the generated stored value sets each calculator module provides this information along with the data identifying the master template which was used to generate the stored value sets to controller  along with other selected correlation data that the calculator modules may have been programmed to provide the controller is operative to receive the signals from each of the calculator modules and to determine which master template produced the highest level of correlation with the sensed value set the controller module is further operative to determine if the correlation value which is the highest is over a first threshold which indicates that the level of correlation is likely to be indicative of the note type associated with the particular master template the controller  then transmits signals to the communication subassembly  indicative of the note type identified or signals indicative that the note identified is suspect because its highest correlation level is not above the threshold in alternative embodiments the controller  may test to determine if the correlation value exceeds other thresholds and transmit signals indicative of the fitness of the note for further use or other signals relating to the genuineness or suspect character of the note the communication subassembly  transmits signals to a communications bus connected to the apparatus of the present invention and to other devices and systems which are operative to further process the note or provide information about the note while in the preferred embodiment of the control circuit  is adapted to performing the calculating functions required for identifying the types of notes in other embodiments other control circuit configurations may be used further in the preferred form of the control circuit  the memories  which make up the data store may be programmed through the apparatus this may be done in a setup mode as discussed by selectively positioning sample notes and moving them in controlled relation adjacent the spot sensing assemblies to gather the data necessary to produce the master templates this is done by having the module controller  control the operation of the note transport to move the sample notes at a speed which will enable gathering data at all the desired locations on the note the controller  may also be programmed in the setup mode to receive signals indicative of the note type and the transverse offset positions of the note used to provide template data in the memories  which comprise the data store alternatively the stored data may be produced in a different apparatus and loaded into the memories  through the controller  or from another source in this approach stored values may be gathered from static analysis of sample notes in the preferred embodiment the optical sensors and electronic subassembly  further includes a compensator circuit that facilitates calibration of the spot sensing assemblies in the preferred form of the invention the optical sensors and electronic subassembly is calibrated using a selected standard grade of white paper which is passed through the note transport adjacent to the spot sensing assemblies in the calibration mode the optical sensors and electronic subassembly  is operative to adjust the amount of radiation generated by each of emitters to produce a preset output this ensures that the level of radiation produced by each of the emitters is sufficient to correlate accurately with the stored value sets that are produced of course in other embodiments of the invention other types or reference material may be used for purposes of calibration periodic calibration of the optical sensors and electronic subassembly  ensures that changes in the emitters over time or changes in the optical path due to accumulation of dust or other contaminants will not adversely impact the accuracy of the apparatus due to the nature of light emitting diodes leds used for the emitters and the nature of the control circuitry which generally responds to relative values rather than absolute values in the preferred embodiment calibration is required infrequently as can be appreciated from the foregoing description the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention presents the advantage that it is capable of identifying notes that are presented in any orientation it further operates to identify notes at high speed and without the need to have the notes precisely aligned or positioned with respect to a frame of reference the preferred embodiment of the present invention further has the advantage that it is readily adaptable to different types of currency notes or other document types and can be used to detect suspect or counterfeit notes the preferred form of the present invention is also readily adaptable to different types of notes and may be programmed to simultaneously identify notes from different countries which have different properties and which are different sizes further due to the data available the preferred form of the present invention may be programmed to analyze certain sensed values in greater detail to point out characteristics that may be associated with unsuitably worn or counterfeit notes the preferred embodiment of the present invention further presents the advantage that it is rapidly configured programmed readily calibrated and does not require frequent adjustment thus the new
