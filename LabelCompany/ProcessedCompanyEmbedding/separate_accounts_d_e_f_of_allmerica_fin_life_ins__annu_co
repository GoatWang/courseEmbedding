defendant violated its fiduciary duty by construing the mortgage transaction to defendants benefit and plaintiffs detriment docket entry   ¶  defendant claims that plaintiffs argument fails as a matter of law because under massachusetts law the relationship between a lender and a borrower without more does not establish a fiduciary relationship famm steel inc v  sovereign bank  fd  0 st cir0

havkin wilson altered her description of the loan docket entry   ¶  docket entry   ¶  neither havkin nor plaintiff articulate from what or to what wilson allegedly changed her description or provide

bakis held that in targeting the greek community the bank knew and exploited the fact that the investor had a deep respect for financial institutions as well as a deep personal trust and respect for  the banks agent id the banks actions constituted a selfbenefitting acceptance of the investors trust such that a fiduciary relationship was formed id while the bank in bakis directly solicited investors plaintiff and defendant lacked any direct relationship certainly not one of deep personal trust and respect there is no evidence in the record that plaintiff placed its trust in anyone other than havkin nor that defendant knew of or accepted any offers of trust from plaintiff plaintiff has additionally failed to specify or demonstrate any special relationship between plaintiff and defendant or any specific deception on defendants part since no fiduciary duty exists when the relationship is an armslength lenderborrower business relationship not one of trust and confidence defendant cannot be held to fiduciary duty standards as to plaintiff famm steel inc v sovereign bank  fd at 0 in sum there is no justification for an exception to the general rule that under

defendant consented to an agency relationship with nor wielded any control over elite or havkin docket entry   while there is no evidence of mutual consent express or implied that elite or havkin is to act on behalf and for the benefit of defendant there is an express agreement stating the contrary theos  sons inc v mack trucks inc  ned at  the wholesale broker agreement explicitly states that neither party shall at any time hold itself out to any third party to be an agent or employee of another docket entry   ex g this document articulates defendants lack of consent to an agency relationship with elite for the purpose of discerning an actual agency relationship plaintiffs ignorance of it is immaterial in light of this document defendant cannot be held to have consented to an actual agency relationship with elite or havkin as discussed above plaintiff has failed to produce sufficient evidence of wilsons interactions with havkin and elite arguments regarding wilsons alleged actions and statements therefore cannot be relied upon to demonstrate consent on behalf of defendant plaintiff likewise does not support his claim that elite or havkin was in any way subject to the defendants control theos  sons inc v mack trucks inc  ned at  see commonwealth  aluminum corp v baldwin corp 0 fsupp at  the essence of the principalagent relationship is the right of power or control

parties docket entry   ex g there is no evidence in the record to contradict this agreement plaintiff also alleges that havkin acted with the apparent authority of defendant massachusetts law recognizes apparent authority where conduct by a principal causes a third person reasonably to believe that a particular person  has authority to enter into negotiations or to make representations as his agent kansallis fin ltd v fern  fd  0 st cir quoting hudson v mass prop ins underwriting assn  mass 0  ned    see restatement second of agency §  apparent authority is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which reasonably interpreted causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the

fern  fd at 0 plaintiff fails to produce evidence that defendant acted in a manner to justify a reasonable belief that havkin or elite was an agent of defendant while plaintiff may have signed the closing documents and not canceled the transaction in reliance on havkins assurances that the terms would be altered there is no evidence that defendant undertook any conduct that would cause plaintiff to reasonably believe that those assurances were made by an agent of or per the instruction of defendant the mere allegation that plaintiff believed havkin to be an agent of some lender

v fern  fd at 0 requiring conduct by a principal absent a showing of any conduct that would cause plaintiff to reasonably believe that havkin was an agent of defendant the relationship between plaintiff and defendant remains merely one of a lender and borrower where no fiduciary duty is owed see famm steel inc v sovereign bank  fd at 0 relationship between a lender and a borrower without more does not establish a fiduciary relationship plaintiff cites to trifiro for the proposition that defendant through some conduct bestowed apparent authority onto havkin docket entry   plaintiff

negotiations with trifiro and his agents and breached a contract to market several commercial properties to trifiro trifiro v ny life ins co  lexis   trifiro claimed that the analyst was actively involved in the negotiation process and in a position of ostensible authority such that nyl must be held to the terms as negotiated id at  plaintiff submits that the facts at bar are analogous  there is no evidence however that defendant was indisputably actively involved in the negotiation such that a belief of apparent authority would be reasonable docket entry   the trifiro courts in fact reached a similar conclusion while holding that an argument could be made that the analyst acted with ostensible authority any reliance by trifiro upon the analysts statements was not reasonable as a matter of law because the assertions were made as part of mere preliminary negotiations trifiro v ny life ins co  lexis    see  fd at  purchaser did not reasonably rely on statement by vendors officer

assertions after acknowledging that the terms contained in the closing documents were vastly inconsistent with those negotiated and acknowledging that it is the actual closing paper work that really matters is similarly unreasonable docket entry   ex m in sum although agency is usually a question of fact plaintiff fails in his burden to provide evidence demonstrating that defendant and havkin were in an actual apparent or implied agency relationship no genuine issue of material fact therefore exists and plaintiffs claim fails as a matter of law as no fiduciary relationship exists between defendant as a lender and plaintiff as a borrower and as there is no evidence that havkin acted as an agent of defendant summary judgment is warranted in defendants favor on count iii ii unjust

plaintiffs original mortgages were to be less than 0 docket entry   in addition the promissory note is secured against plaintiffs residence so that if defendant forecloses on its security interest defendant may obtain ownership of plaintiffs home docket entry   defendant counters that plaintiff did not bestow any benefit on defendant for which it is unjust for defendant to retain docket entry

with oregon revised statute ors  or merely as a restraint on solicitation which need only comply with common law after january  0 any noncompetition agreement entered into between an employer and an employee is voidable and may not be enforced by a court of this state unless four requirements are met ors  first the employer must inform the employee in a written employment offer received by the employee at least two weeks before the first day of the employees employment that a noncompetition agreement is required as a condition of employment or the agreement is entered into upon a subsequent bona fide advancement of the employee by the employer id at a second the employee must be employed as an exempt administrative executive or professional employee id at b    order third the employee must have access to trade secrets or competitively sensitive confidential business or professional information id at c fourth the employees total annual gross salary and commissions at the time of the

insufficient notice of the agreements prior to their employment roderick was hired on january   and signed her agreement that same day without any prior notice petersen executed his agreement on

prospective customers away from plaintiff the overall effect of the agreement is to prevent defendants from competing with plaintiff moreover case law interpreting prior versions of ors  has consistently held that an agreement restraining an employee from directly or indirectly soliciting business from former  the court declines plaintiffs invitation to rewrite the scope of the agreement

employee from directly or indirectly soliciting clients or otherwise causing the employer to lose clients was a noncompetition agreement even though it was intended as a nonsolicitation agreement

employee from engaging in the same business as the employer first allmerica fin life ins co v sumner  f supp d   d or  holding that a contractual provision restraining an employees ability to solicit former customers and coworkers amounts to a noncompetition agreement plaintiff has not articulated a persuasive basis for the court to depart from this line of cases alternatively even if the nonsolicitation agreement is simply a restraint on trade plaintiff has not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of this claim to be enforceable a restrictive covenant must be  partial or restricted in its operation in respect either to time or place  on some good consideration and  must be reasonable that is it should afford only a fair protection to the interests of the party in whose favor it is made and must not be so large in its operation as to interfere with the interests of the public nike inc v mccarthy  fd   th cir  citation omitted although plaintiff may succeed as to the first two elements plaintiff has not demonstrated that the nonsolicitation agreement is reasonable again the court finds the breadth of the agreement to be troubling on its face the agreement precludes defendants from   order engaging in conduct that even indirectly diverts former or prospective customers from plaintiff it does not merely restrict defendants from soliciting clients they had actual contacts with while employed by plaintiff see konecranes inc v sinclair  f supp d   d or  in deciding whether a noncompete agreement is reasonable an important consideration is whether it merely restricts the former employee from luring away specific accounts  ie those he serviced while employed or whether it restricts the employee from competing at all plaintiff has also not met its burden as to the confidentiality agreement the confidentiality agreement provides that during the term of this agreement and indefinitely subsequent to the termination of this agreement for whatever reason the employee shall not directly or indirectly under any circumstances or by any means disclose or divulge or use for the employees benefit or for the benefit of any third party the confidential information of the company without the express written consent of the president of the company compl at ex   further the employees must return all confidential information or materials that are the property of the employer upon request or upon termination of employment id the confidentiality agreement however does not prohibit defendants from using information for legitimate business purposes within the scope of employees employment id based on the testimony provided any allegedly improper downloading or emailing may have been performed for legitimate business purposes defendants testified that their conduct enabled them to work from home to compare their client lists with their commission reports to ensure that they were properly compensated or to otherwise complete their work for plaintiff while it is clear that defendants may have violated the confidentiality agreement by retaining plaintiffs property injunctive relief is not a proper remedy as it does not appear that there is any   order ongoing potential for harm irreparable or otherwise any alleged harm can be remedied with damages additionally after consulting with plaintiffs counsel regarding potential spoliation issues defendants have agreed to delete any retained data that is the property of plaintiff b uniform trade secrets act utsa claim to establish a claim under the utsa plaintiff must demonstrate that  the subject of the claim qualifies as a statutory trade secret  the plaintiff employed reasonable measures to maintain the secrecy of its trade secrets and  the conduct of the defendants constitutes statutory misappropriation acrymed inc v convatec  f supp d 0  d or  according to the statute a trade secret includes information including a drawing cost data customer list formula pattern compilation program device method technique or process that a derives independent economic value actual or potential from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and b is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy ors  a customer list can sometimes be a trade secret eg when the employer has expended considerable time and money to pinpoint a narrow segment of the population that is interested in this product or service ikon office solutions inc v am office products inc  f supp d   d or  this includes nonpublic information about clients that employees have agreed to keep confidential dial temporary help servs v shrock  f supp   d or  however a customer list is not considered a trade secret if the information is publicly available or can be easily identified by a person with rudimentary knowledge of the   order industry ikon office solutions inc  f supp d at  citing w med consultants inc v johnson  f supp   d or  customer information not trade secret if it is commonly known in the industry or readily ascertainable through public sources here plaintiffs allegedly secret customer lists consist of contact information for law firms and attorneys who previously scheduled court reporting services with plaintiff see hunt decl under seal exs ac presumably any person familiar with the court reporting industry would know that law firms and attorneys are prospective clients for a court reporting firm the only information in plaintiffs lists that is not publicly available is the date of plaintiffs last contact with that client and the name of the legal assistant who contacted plaintiff the court recognizes that the identity of the legal assistants who arrange for court reporters may be valuable to plaintiff and defendants but is not confident that it is a trade secret although plaintiff has taken efforts to keep its act sales database and customer lists private plaintiff has not shown that it has expended considerable effort or expense to create its lists or that it derives independent economic value from the publicly available contact information plaintiff has however raised a serious question regarding whether plaintiffs court reporter list should be considered a trade secret plaintiffs list of reliable wellqualified and recommended court reporters has been honed over several years and is not publicly available defendants may have improperly retained this list following the end of their employment with plaintiff but do not believe that they have the list in any event this factor weighs in favor of an injunction 0  order c computer fraud and abuse act cfaa an individual is liable under the cfaa if he or she knowingly and with intent to defraud accesses a protected computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than  in any year period  usc § 0a again the court finds that plaintiff has not established that it is likely to succeed on this claim because defendants credibly testified that any computer access was legitimate and part of defendants duties while employed by plaintiff however roderick admits that she sent client lists to petersen after he had been terminated and that defendants continued to email documents to their personal accounts after being warned to stop that conduct immediately by plaintiff such evidence raises some questions as to whether defendants exceeded their authority this factor weighs slightly in plaintiffs favor  irreparable harm plaintiff contends that its loss of its confidential client information and loss of business constitutes irreparable harm see alexander  alexander benefits servs inc v benefit brokers  consultants inc  f supp   d or  finding a probability of success on the merits and irreparable harm where the defendants admitted taking copies of the employers client activity reports and customer files and the employer would be unable to fairly compete because of the misappropriation at this point the court finds no irreparable harm defendants have admittedly returned or will delete any of plaintiffs property that they retained following their termination of employment defendants testified that they have never used any of those   order documents to divert business from plaintiff thus far plaintiff has presented no evidence that it will be unable to fairly compete with esquire or other related businesses because of defendants conduct the loss of plaintiffs confidential court reporter list could limit plaintiffs inability to contract with wellqualified court reporters this harm however can be reasonably quantified and remedied with damages therefore this factor weighs against the issuance of an injunction  balance of hardships plaintiff has only demonstrated serious questions going to the merits of its claims so the balance of hardships must tip sharply in its favor to obtain an injunction see alliance for the wild rockies  fd at  plaintiff asserts a legitimate interest in preventing defendants from disseminating plaintiffs confidential information and soliciting plaintiffs clients although defendants may be voluntarily restricting their marketing practices for esquire in the portland area they have received no threats to their jobs with esquire at this time the hardships favor plaintiff  public interest plaintiff argues that the public interest in contracts and business development would be furthered by this injunction this court disagrees the public interest would be disserved by the enforcement of an unduly broad and statutorily voidable contract although defendants may have breached their confidentiality agreements or exceeded their authority in their use of plaintiffs information the only potentially confidential information held by defendants is the list of reliable court reporters because these court reporters are independent contractors this court believes that any injunction affecting the court reporters ability to obtain work would not serve   order the public interest if this list is later deemed to be a trade secret

resolution of this matter see ed mich lr f for the reasons stated below the court grants defendant s motion for judgment on the administrative record grants defendant s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim denies plaintiff s motion for judgment on the administrative record and grants defendant s motion to strike i statement of facts plaintiff benjamin dehart worked for northwest airlines as an airplane mechanic he worked from september   until november   the date he was placed on medical leave of absence for injuries arising from an automobile accident in which his vehicle was rearended by a truck soon thereafter dehart sought long term disability benefits  ltd  under northwest s group employee benefit plan entitled northwest airlines department a0 disability benefit plan the plan  effective june   the plan issued and administered by defendant life insurance company of north america  lina  a subsidiary of cigna corporation provides ltd benefits to employees who offer continued satisfactory proof of disability ar  the plan defines disability as the following an employee is considered disabled if solely because of injury or sickness he or she is  unable to perform the material duties of his or her regular occupation and  after disability benefits have been payable for  months the employee is considered disabled if solely due to injury or sickness he or she is unable to perform all the material duties of any occupation for which he or she is or may reasonably become qualified based on education training or experience ar  in accordance with the plan lina determined dehart could not meet the duties of his regular occupation as an airplane mechanic he began receiving ltd benefits on january 0 0 after the accident dehart began treatment with dr marvin bleiberg for pain in his neck and back the treatment was relatively unsuccessful in relieving the pain  based on the results of an mri dr teck mun soo diagnosed dehart with traumatic spondylopathy disc herniation c c c bilateral l radiculopathy myelopathy and carpel tunnel ar  he underwent decompression and fusion surgery of the spine on october  0 id prior to the surgery in march 0 dehart applied for and received social security disability benefits ar  on february  0 dehart received a  million settlement arising out of his thirdparty tort action filed against the driver of the truck doc  ex b he did not notify lina of the settlement on september  0 dehart underwent another mri which indicated that the fusion was stable ar  a month later dr bleiberg performed an electrodiagnostic nerve conduction study on dehart ar  dr bleiberg found carpel tunnel syndrome on the right and left and that there is no electrodiagnostic evidence for a cervical radiculopathy ar  several months later on january 0 0 the standard for disability changed requiring dehart to demonstrate that he was unfit to perform any occupation in order to continue receiving ltd benefits ar  nonetheless lina approved payment under this standard and continued dehart s benefits during this time dehart also received insurance benefits from state farm his nofault carrier on september  0 nearly four years after the accident dehart visited dr joseph femminineo for an independent medical examination  ime  requested by state farm based on the exam dr femminineo concluded that dehart was able to perform sedentary and lightduty work ar  on march  0 a transferable skills analysis revealed that dehart could perform sedentary and light occupations such  as electric meter repairer parts manager and aircraft equipment sales representative ar  therefore on march  0 lina notified dehart that he failed to qualify for continuing ltd benefits ar  on june  0 dehart appealed the termination of his benefits in support he submitted a letter dated april  0 from dr bleiberg stating mr dehart is permanently disabled from any and all gainful employment ar  dr bleiberg noted that dehart required several medications to treat his pain including oxycontin methadone baclofen restoril albutrin and zoloft resulting in decreased concentration and fatigue ar  dr bleiberg also posited that dehart requires the ability to alternate sitting standing walking and lying down at will and that dehart would likely miss several days of work because of the pain in his neck and back id dehart also submitted several office notes detailing dehart s recurring visits to dr bleiberg during  ar 0 dr charles mccool lina s associate medical director and dr donald minteer separately reviewed dehart s appeal both concluded that the medical information indicated that dehart could perform light to sedentary work ar  therefore lina upheld its decision to terminate benefits ar 0 dehart then filed a second appeal on december   lina assigned the case to dr francis hall to conduct an independent peer review ar  dr hall concluded that dehart could at least return to sedentary work ar  notably dr hall unsuccessfully attempted to contact dr bleiberg twice ar  on february  0 lina affirmed its decision to terminate benefits ar  on april  0 dehart filed the instant action seeking judicial review of the termination of his  benefits under erisa upon disclosure of the  million settlement agreement the court granted leave for lina to amend its answer and file a counterclaim to recover overpayment of benefits doc  ii standard of review motions for judgment on the administrative record in an erisa action are not akin to motions for summary judgment under fed r civ p a see wilkins v baptist healthcare sys inc 0 fd   th cir   this standard of review does not neatly fit under either rule  or rule  but is a specially fashioned rule designed to carry out congress s intent under erisa  accordingly a district court reviews an erisa plan administrators denial of benefits de novo unless the plan grants the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits cox v standard ins co  fd   th cir 0 citing gismondi v united techs corp  fd   th cir 0 if the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority a court applies the highly deferential aarbitrary and capricious standard of review id the arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action when it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation based on the evidence for a particular outcome that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious schwalm v guardian life ins co of america  fd   th cir  internal quotation marks omitted quoting shields v readers digest assn inc  fd   th cir 0 even when a claimant has introduced evidence that might be sufficient to support a finding of disability if there is a reasonable explanation for the administrators decision denying benefits because of the plans provisions then the decision is neither arbitrary nor capricious  id citing williams v intl paper co  fd   th cir  therefore a reviewing court must uphold the administrators decision if it is the result of a deliberate principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence baker v united mine workers of am health  ret funds  fd   th cir  iii analysis a appropriate standard of review arbitrary and capricious lina asserts that the plan contains language granting it discretionary authority to determine benefit eligibility and thus the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies cox  fd at  indeed the plan provides claimant must provide to lina at his or her own expense satisfactory proof of disability before benefits will be paid ar  see also ar  lina shall have the authority in its discretion    to decide questions of eligibility for coverage or benefits under the plan  dehart does not dispute the effect of plan language indeed such language is sufficient to confer discretionary authority to lina see perez v aetna life ins co 0 fd 0  th cir  noting that language requiring satisfactory evidence to the insurer or to the company created a clear grant of discretion  as such the court finds the language sufficient to grant discretion to lina in determining benefit eligibility nonetheless dehart asserts the court must review the decision de novo because  connecticut general life insurance company  cglic  a wholly owned subsidiary of cigna sent a letter to the michigan commissioner of insurance warranting that cglic does not use forms containing discretionary clauses in its policies  minnesota law prohibits discretionary clauses in insurance policies and   lina as both claims administrator and insurer operated under a conflict of interest in processing dehart s claim each argument will be addressed in turn first dehart asserts lina is bound by cglic s statement that it does not use forms containing discretionary clauses in its policies issued in michigan doc  ex  lina is a wholly owned subsidiary of cglic however the plan in this case was issued in minnesota not michigan ar  regardless subsidiaries are treated as wholly separate corporations under michigan law and thus must be treated as such see wells v firestone tire  rubber co  nwd 0  mich   we recognize the general principle that in michigan separate entities will be respected  consequently lina cannot reasonably be bound by statements in a letter sent from a parent corporation to the insurance department of another state dehart s argument is without merit next dehart argues minn stat § q prohibits discretionary clauses in policies issued after january   lina s ltd plan was issued june   the statute provides in relevant part no health plan    may specify a standard of review upon which a court may review denial of a claim or of any other decision made by a health plan company with respect to an enrollee this section prohibits limiting court review to a determination of whether the health plan company s decision is arbitrary and capricious an abuse of discretion or any other standard less favorable to the enrollee than a preponderance of the evidence minn stat § q health plan is a statutorily defined term that expressly excludes disability or income protection coverage minn stat § a0 because the policy at issue concerns only ltd benefits and is not a health plan under minnesota law the statute is inapplicable  last dehart argues that a conflict of interest influenced lina s decision and thus the court must review the decision de novo the general rule is that an apparent conflict of interest arises when the administrator both determines eligibility for benefits and is responsible for paying such benefits see glenn v metro life ins co  fd 0  th cir 0 noting that such a dual function creates an apparent conflict of interest  in such a case the conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion firestone tire  rubber co v bruch  us 0   internal citation omitted here lina as administrator determined eligibility for benefits and paid out benefits lina contracted with professional disability associates  pda  which employed dr hall to review dehart s appeal contrary to dehart s claim an apparent conflict of interest does not require the court to engage in de novo review see kalish v liberty mut  fd 0  th cir 0 rather it is only a factor in the court s analysis as to whether the decision was arbitrary and capricious moreover other than a blanket statement that lina routinely hires pda to review claims dehart provides no evidence that pda or dr hall are prone to find in favor of lina merely because lina paid for the independent peer review see peruzzi v summa med plan  fd   th cir  requiring significant evidence that the conflict of interest tainted the decision such unsupported conclusory statements do not demonstrate that the decision was tainted consequently the court will place little weight on this factor in its analysis of lina s decision to terminate benefits and the decision will be analyzed under the arbitrary and capricious standard  b lina s decision was not arbitrary and capricious lina s decision to terminate benefits will be upheld if it is the result of a deliberate principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence baker  fd at  dehart bears the burden of demonstrating he is eligible for benefits ar  he argues that lina improperly terminated his ltd benefits because his condition has not improved and he is still completely disabled specifically he argues lina ignored the medical evidence provided by his treating physician dr bleiberg indicating the severe pain he experiences on a daily basis precluding his ability to work any occupation dehart also asserts lina failed to consider the ruling by the commissioner of social security that he is disabled in contrast lina claims dehart is able to perform at least sedentary work and failed to meet his continuing burden for ltd benefits lina asserts it considered the award of social security benefits and properly discounted dr bleiberg s conclusions based on the medical evidence in the record  social security administration s decision a finding of disability by the social security administration  ssa  does not automatically entitle a claimant to benefits under an erisa plan since the plan s disability criteria may differ from the social security administration s delisle v sun life assur co of canada  fd   th cir 0 citing whitaker v hartford  fd   th cir 0 however where the plan administrator  encourages the applicant to apply for social security disability payments  financially benefits from the applicant s receipt of social security and then  fails to explain it is taking a position different from the ssa on the question of disability the reviewing court should weigh this in favor of a finding that the decision was arbitrary or capricious  bennett v kemper nat servs inc  fd   th cir 0 in the instant case it is undisputed that lina encouraged dehart to apply for social security disability benefits and that lina benefitted from the award because it reduced its obligation in fact lina hired an attorney to represent dehart in the matter dehart argues that lina failed to provide an explanation for discounting the decision of the ssa and thus this factor weighs in his favor that the decision was arbitrary and capricious in the letter denying dehart s appeal lina stated we are aware that mr dehart was awarded social security disability benefits however the standard for determining disability under this policy may be different from the standard used by the social security administration ssa as a fiduciary under northwest airlines departments ltd policy we are required to make our determination based on the applicable provisions of the policy and the proof of loss information available without an opinion from ssa explaining the basis for its decision we cannot evaluate its reasoning and so can take note of its decision but cannot rely on or otherwise promote that decision ahead of other proof of claim and policy information we must make our determination independent of social security s determination and based upon the medical information provided and the specific policy provision requirements under northwest airlines department policy number lk  ar  in contrast to the above statement dehart asserts lina received the ssa opinion in 0 ar  although lina received notice of the decision there is no evidence in the record that it received the actual opinion detailing the ssa s rationale for a finding of disability the fax dated march 0 0 does not contain the ssa opinion in fact dehart cites no evidence that he submitted it to lina in accordance with his burden to demonstrate his disability undoubtedly lina cannot provide an explanation for something it did not possess during its determination 0 dr hall did consider the award letter in his review but did not provide a discussion of its contents because he did not possess the actual opinion ar  perhaps most importantly the ssa s decision predates lina s decision to terminate benefits by over three years during this time dehart underwent intense surgery and substantial medical treatment for his injuries resulting in improved functionality lina explained its reasoning for not following the ssa s decision noting that it must conduct its own review in accordance with the plan language and that dehart never submitted the actual opinion as evidence of his disability due to the changing circumstances of dehart s treatment the ssa s disability determination offers little probative value as evidence of dehart s disability at the time lina terminated ltd benefits regardless the court will consider this factor in dehart s favor but will afford it little weight  medical evidence lina terminated benefits based on its conclusion that dehart failed to demonstrate his inability to perform the material duties of any occupation because he is able to perform sedentary to light work as evidence of that he cannot perform even sedentary work dehart points to several statements in dr bleiberg s april 0 letter that his pain is debilitating and that he is completely and permanently disabled dehart submitted the letter in support of both appeals in all dr bleiberg listed eighteen different diagnoses affecting dehart he also stated that despite all of the treatment mr dehart remains with severe pain and significant functional deficits to the present time ar 0 he further notes that dehart complains of insomnia and severe back spasms id in terms of functional limitations dr bleiberg noted that the amount of  medication dehart requires leads to fatigue and concentration problems based on his pain dr bleiberg concluded that dehart requires the ability to alternate sitting standing walking and lying down at will ar  he further posited that this would require dehart to miss numerous days of work precluding any ability to maintain gainful employment dr bleiberg s extensive patient notes document dehart s consistent complaints of pain for example on july   dehart complained of a sharp and stabbing sensation in his back ar  however dr bleiberg noted that there is no specific aggravating factor and that not much is seeming sic to help id lina correctly points out that dr bleiberg never conducted a physical examination in order to determine functionality dr bleiberg confirmed this in his deposition ar  when asked how dehart s functionality was determined dr bleiberg stated that it was solely based on what dehart tells him id in contrast dr femminineo conducted a comprehensive physical examination and concluded that dehart could return to work with restrictions ar 0 these restrictions included avoidance of lifting weight greater than 0 pounds avoidance of repetitive bending stooping and twisting at the waist and in particular avoidance of extension of the cervical spine and lumbar spine over extended periods of time  id dr femminineo also recommended weaning dehart off of the several pain medications as dehart had reached maximum medical improvement noting he is on some very potent longacting narcotic agents for his present subjective complaints id he expressed concern that dehart had been taking the medications for several years dehart attacks this analysis citing dr bleiberg s deposition testimony that dr femminineo failed to take into account dehart s cervical and lumbar radiculopathy  pinched nerves muscle spasms severe pain and narcotic medications ar  in essence these all relate to dehart s complaints of pain however dr femminineo s physical functional analysis revealed dehart possessed enough functionality without pain to perform sedentary work notwithstanding his complaints of pain in his lower back and neck remarkably dr bleiberg s september 0 report expressly found no electrodiagnostic evidence for a cervical radiculopathy contradicting his deposition testimony ar  dehart offers no explanation for this discrepancy dr bleiberg never conducted a physical functional analysis instead relying solely upon dehart s selfreported complaints dehart fails to provide any other reason as to why dr femminineo s medical opinion is unsound certainly lina reasonably afforded greater weight to dr femminineo s functional analysis as opposed to dr bleiberg s second hand reports of dehart s pain in his neck and back this also undermines dr bleiberg s conclusion that side effects of the several prescribed narcotic medications preclude dehart s ability to work dr femminineo concluded that the medications should be gradually discontinued thereby removing any side effects that interfere with concentration or cause fatigue during work moreover dr hall dr mccool and dr minteer all concluded that dehart could return to at least sedentary work dehart takes issue with lina s reliance on these paper reviews however there is nothing inherently objectionable about a file review by a qualified physician in the context of a benefits determination calvert v firstar fin inc  fd   th cir 0 in his review dr hall noted that dehart had grade one anteriolithesis and moderate to severe loss of invertebral disc space ar  however he stated that this is likely a cause for him to have low back  pain difficulties but by itself does not determine how debilitating his pain is and should not be considered fully debilitating with a competent functional analysis id further dr hall noted that although dehart self reports pain little is offered in the form of treatment aside from medical management ar  dr hall also noted that dehart stated that he could perform daily living activities and that he rides an exercise bike for ten minutes a day in all four independent physicians determined that dehart could at least return to sedentary work thus it was reasonable for lina to discount dr bleiberg s findings considering that dr bleiberg never determined dehart s functionality dr bleiberg merely relegated dehart to prescription drugs based on his complaints of severe pain indeed a plan administrator is not required to accept opinions of the claimant s treating physician when contrary medical evidence exists see cooper v life ins co of north am  fd   th cir 0 noting that insurer was not obligated to blindly accept the treating physicians opinions  here dr bleiberg s conclusion that dehart is permanently disabled and unable to maintain gainful employment is substantially based on dehart s complaints of pain and unsupported by the evidence notably dehart offers no other evidence to refute the findings of the four other physicians lina did not ignore dr bleiberg s opinion but reasonably concluded that dehart could return to work in at least a sedentary capacity after being disabled for several years as a result of the accident  conclusion dehart concedes that it is his burden to demonstrate that he is disabled however a substantial majority of the medical evidence indicates that he can return to  work in at least a sedentary capacity after weighing all of the relevant factors including the little weight afforded to both the apparent conflict of interest and ssa s decision it is clear lina performed a full and fair review of dehart s claim under this very deferential standard lina s decision is not arbitrary and capricious where objective medical evidence of dehart s inability to perform sedentary work is lacking c lina s counterclaim  standard of review lina s counterclaim to recover overpaid benefits is not entitled to deferential review but is appropriately analyzed as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule a see lee v kaiser found health plan long term 0 wl   nd cal february  0 noting that because defendant s counterclaim does not implicate the denial of longterm disability benefits    the court finds it appropriate to treat the present motions as motions for summary judgment  summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law fed r civ p a the central inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so onesided that one party must prevail as a matter of law anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    rule  mandates summary judgment against a party who fails to establish the existence of an element essential to the partys case and on which that party bears the burden of proof at trial celotex corp v catrett  us      lina s motion to strike before turning to the merits of lina s counterclaim the court must address lina s motion to strike several affidavits addressing dehart s settlement award in 0 in support of his argument that lina is not entitled to overpayment dehart submitted affidavits from leonard koltonow and james borin both michigan attorneys koltonow who represented dehart in the negligence lawsuit attests that the lawsuit did not arise out of a work loss provision in a nofault insurance policy doc  ex  it also states that the settlement did not allocate payment for lost wages id similarly the affidavit of borin states that the clear language of the plan does not confer a right of set off of proceeds from any tort or negligence settlement doc  ex  lina also seeks to strike dehart s affidavit which states that state farm has continued its payment of benefits doc  dehart s affidavit is offered as evidence of his disability but was never presented to lina during its review of dehart s claim the court did not consider it in its analysis above consequently the court will strike the affidavit see racknor v first allmerica fin life ins co  f supp d   ed mich   the court may not admit or consider any evidence not presented to the administrator  it is clear that the affidavits of koltonow and borin are offered as legal conclusions that the settlement proceeds from the negligence lawsuit do not qualify as other income benefits under the plan the court refuses to accept these affidavits as support for dehart s position see berent v kemper corp 0 f supp   n ed mich  noting that the court is not required and expressly refuses to accept as support for a party s position with respect to a pending motion an affidavit of a  thirdparty    who offers nothing more than his personal opinion regarding the law  although koltonow represented dehart in the negligence suit his opinions regarding the interpretation of lina s plan language are irrelevant consequently the court will strike both affidavits  no genuine dispute of fact exists under erisa a plan fiduciary may commence a civil action to obtain other appropriate equitable relief    to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan  usc § a the plan provides that if a disabled employee entitled to ltd benefits receives additional other income benefits those benefits will reduce any benefits payable or will result in a request for a lump sum payment of the overpaid amount ar   other income benefits include any amounts which the employee receives or is assumed to receive under    any work loss provision in mandatory nofault auto insurance id the plan further provides that other income benefits or earnings that are paid in a lump sum will be prorated over the period for which the sum is given if no time is stated the lump sum will be prorated monthly over a five year period ar  in addition if no specific allocation of a lump sum payment is made then the total payment will be an other income benefit id here lina seeks return of the overpayment of benefits to dehart not for a portion of his settlement based on the plan language which grants lina authority to recover overpaid benefits the court finds lina s counterclaim qualifies as appropriate equitable relief under § a see thurber v aetna life ins co  fd   d cir  holding that claimant held administrator s overpayment of  benefits in constructive trust upon which administrator held an equitable lien thereby constituting equitable relief under erisa lina asserts that the  million settlement dehart received as a result of his thirdparty tort action filed against the driver of the truck constitutes other income benefits because it results from work loss damages under mandatory nofault auto insurance thus lina overpaid dehart s benefits in the amount of  dehart does not dispute this amount the plan expressly provides that lina may recover overpaid benefits if the claimant receives other benefits pursuant to any work loss provision in mandatory nofault auto insurance under michigan nofault law an injured party s recovery is limited to  of lost wages for up to three years see mich comp laws § b however michigan s mandatory nofault scheme also authorizes thirdparty actions for noneconomic and economic damages in excess of  of three years worth of work loss mcl § c indeed dehart s action expressly sought damages for all allowable expenses and work loss in excess of the daily monthly and three year limitations plus all other economic damages allowable under the michigan nofault law doc  ex a ¶  dehart received a  million settlement arising out of his thirdparty tort action clearly dehart s settlement proceeds constitute other income benefits under the policy as they arise out of any work loss provision in mandatory nofault auto insurance per the reimbursement agreement dehart was required to promptly notify lina of any award of other benefits received ar  in addition because the settlement did not allocate or differentiate between  work loss payments and noneconomic damages the entire lump sum offsets the benefits paid by lina from the time of settlement dehart argues that the settlement proceeds do not constitute other income benefits under the plan for several reasons first he argues the plan does not expressly require offset from an auto negligence lawsuit and that the settlement did not account for lost wages or income replacement dehart filed the suit seeking damages under michigan s nofault scheme the mere fact that the settlement agreement did not allocate any categories of damages is not dispositive notably dehart s suit would have been barred but for the express provision permitting such actions in the michigan nofault scheme dehart relies on baxter v sun life assurance company of canada  f supp d  nd ill 0 for the proposition that negligence actions cannot arise under nofault statutory schemes his reliance is misplaced in baxter the beneficiary received a settlement award arising out of a medical malpractice suit brought against the hospital where he received treatment id at  defendant argued that the award constituted other income benefits because it was an amount received due to income replacement or lost wages paid to you by compromise settlement or other method as a result of a claim for any other income benefit id at  the court found the language insufficient to include medical malpractice tort claims within the definition of other income benefits because a malpractice recovery is not a typical income benefit which foreseeably results from a disability id at  perhaps more importantly the claimant s tort action arose out of treatment he received after he became disabled unrelated to the cause of his disability id at  n unlike  baxter dehart s thirdparty tort action sought damages relating to the cause of his disabling condition and fits squarely within the plan language second dehart asserts that because michigan nofault insurance work loss only compensates an insured for up to three years work loss recovery is not a mandatory recovery under mcl §  this argument is off point the plan uses the word mandatory to modify nofault auto insurance it merely refers to the type of nofault scheme which in michigan is mandatory for all operators of automobiles last dehart argues that settlement proceeds do not constitute income under the internal revenue code  irc  his settlement proceeds may not be taxable income under the irc however this does not modify the defined terms of the plan in sum lina is entitled to recover  in overpaid benefits iv conclusion accordingly the court grants defendant s motion for judgment on the administrative record grants defendant s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim denies plaintiff s motion for judgment on the administrative record and grants defendant s motion to strike the decision of the administrator is affirmed it is so ordered

appellant david a jefferson tyree b harris iv and lisa ramsay cole nashville tennessee for appellee massachusetts mutual life insurance company opinionthis appeal involves a clinical psychologist who lost his professional license following a sexual affair with a former patient five months after the board of examiners in psychology revoked his license the psychologist filed a claim with his disability insurance carrier asserting that depression had prompted him to have the affair and had also rendered him unable to practice psychology   the insurance company denied coverage and filed a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court for sumner county seeking to establish its obligations under the psychologists policy   following a bench trial the court determined that the psychologist has failed to demonstrate that he was disabled within the meaning of the policy   on this appeal the psychologist asserts that he is entitled to disability benefits and the insurance company insists that it was entitled to discretionary costs under tenn r civ p 0   we concur with the trial courts conclusion that the psychologist has not demonstrated that he is entitled to benefits under his disability policy   we also find that the insurance company was entitled to recover part of its requested discretionary costsidavid a jefferson obtained a doctorate in clinical psychology and acquired a license to practice psychology in tennessee in    he and his family moved to sumner county where he established a flourishing private practice in hendersonville   in  dr jefferson began treating jane roe  for panic attacks and depression   ms roes panic attacks eventually subsided and dr jefferson discontinued her therapy in august    however dr jefferson and ms roe continued to see each other on a personal basis   even though both of them were married they began having a sexual relationship in october   their affair ended in february  after dr jefferson started an affair with another woman   ms roe retaliated by telephoning dr jeffersons wife and children to tell them about her relationship with dr jefferson and by filing a complaint with the board of examiners in psychology “licensing board” in may  dr jefferson sought therapy from dr wayne c richard another clinical psychologist   dr richard determined that “various stressors” had rendered dr jefferson “somewhat dysfunctional” in his professional and home life  in july  the licensing board filed a formal notice of charges against dr jefferson based on ms roes complaint   dr jefferson responded to these charges by asserting that he was “a highly qualified and competent psychologist” and that “there was no ethical rule ․ which prohibited social or romantic relationships between psychologists and their former patients”   following a hearing on april  and  0 the licensing board entered an order on may  0 finding that dr jefferson had “engaged in improper sexual contact and sexual intercourse with ․ an individual who had recently completed a course of psychotherapy and was still under the influence of that powerful relationship” and that he had “used said individual to fulfill his needs and exploited said individual”   accordingly the licensing board permanently revoked dr jeffersons license to practice psychology in tennesseedr jefferson promptly filed a petition for reconsideration and a motion for a stay of the licensing boards may  0 order   less than one month later he consulted with a physician friend dr william e hardin about “going on disability because of depression” on october  0 dr jefferson filled out a claim form seeking benefits under his disability income policy issued by massachusetts mutual life insurance company “massachusetts mutual”   he described his sickness as “major depression following revocation of license” and stated that he had been totally disabled since april  0 and that he had been receiving treatment from dr hardin since june  0on december  0 the licensing board heard argument on dr jeffersons petition for reconsideration and motion for stay   approximately one month later on january   massachusetts mutual denied dr jeffersons claim for disability benefits   thereafter on february   the licensing board denied his motions to reconsider and to stay its order   dr jefferson then filed an untimely pro se petition for reconsideration of the boards february   order asserting among other things that “i am so rehabilitated that it is almost beyond description”   when the licensing board did not act on his petition dr jefferson sought judicial review of the boards decision in the chancery court for davidson countyin june  massachusetts mutual filed a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court for sumner county to ascertain its rights and obligations under dr jeffersons disability insurance policy   it asserted that dr jeffersons claimed disability was the result of his own voluntary acts rather than a debilitating sickness or injury   after taking proof on october  and november   the trial court entered its judgment on february   concluding that dr jefferson “was not entitled to any benefits under the policy of disability insurance in question ․ having failed to demonstrate that he was unable to work as the direct and proximate result of a compensable disability and did not demonstrate a loss of income of at least twenty percent 0 as the direct and proximate result of a disability․” dr jefferson filed a timely tenn r civ p 0 motion and massachusetts mutual moved for its discretionary costs under tenn r civ p 0on december   while the parties posttrial motions were pending the chancery court for davidson county filed its memorandum and order in the proceeding to review the licensing boards revocation of dr jeffersons license   the chancery court determined that the licensing board erred by finding that dr jefferson had violated the ethical prohibition against clienttherapist relationships   however it found the evidence supported the boards findings that ms roe was still under dr jeffersons influence and that he had exploited their relationship to fulfill his own needs   accordingly the chancery court upheld the licensing boards determination that dr jefferson was guilty of repeated negligence in the course of his practice   the chancery court also reduced dr jeffersons punishment from a permanent revocation to an eightyear suspension ending on may     the court conditioned the reinstatement of dr jeffersons license on the licensing boards imposition of reasonable conditions to assure that his negligent behavior did not reoccur the chancery courts decision prompted dr jefferson to file an amended tenn r civ p 0 motion in this proceeding   on january   the trial court filed an order denying dr jeffersons tenn r civ p 0 motion and massachusetts mutuals motion for discretionary costs   dr jefferson perfected this appeal he now argues that the trial court misconstrued the terms of his disability policy and “did not properly weigh the evidence”   massachusetts mutual asserts that the trial court properly determined that dr jefferson was not entitled to benefits under his disability policy but that the trial court erred by denying its motion for discretionary costsiidr jeffersons disability income policythis appeal requires that we first scrutinize dr jeffersons disability policy because both his rights and massachusetts mutuals obligations are governed by the terms of their contract of insurance merrimack mut fire ins co v batts  swd   tennctapp   in this case the contract of insurance is found in the policy itself “which includes any attached papers and endorsements”   insurance policies are subject to the same rules and principles that are used to construe other contracts  american justice ins reciprocal v hutchison  swd   tenn  williams v berube  assocs  swd   tennctapp   the courts role is to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in their written contract of insurance   harrell v minnesota mut life ins co  swd   tenn  angus v western heritage ins co  swd  0 tennctapp   accordingly when the

tennctapp and should avoid artificially narrowing the policys coverage or extending coverage beyond the policys intended scope   merrimack mut fire ins co v batts  swd at  an insurance policy should be construed fairly and reasonably  angus v western heritage ins co  swd at 0  black v aetna ins co  swd   tennctapp   it should also be construed as a whole english v virginia sur co  tenn  0  swd    and its language should be taken and understood in its plain ordinary and popular sense  american justice ins reciprocal v hutchison  swd at   griffin v shelter mut ins co  swd   tenn   when coverage questions arise the courts should consider the components of an insurance policy in the following order   the declarations  the insuring agreements and definitions  the exclusions  the conditions and  the endorsements  standard fire ins co v chester odonley  assocs  swd   tennctapp   the insuring agreement defines the outer limits of an insurance policys coverage   thus if coverage cannot be found in the insuring agreement it cannot be found elsewhere in the policy  merrimack mut fire ins co v batts  swd at the insuring agreement in dr jeffersons disability policy appears under the heading “income benefit”   it states quite succinctly that “we will pay a monthly income for each month that the insured is disabled beyond the end of the waiting period”   the significant terms in this sentence “monthly income” “disabled” and “waiting period” are defined elsewhere in the policyfor our purposes the term most relevant to this appeal is “disabled” because an insured is not entitled to a monthly income payment for any month in which he or she is not disabled   the term “disability” is defined in the policys definition section asan incapacity of the insured which• is due to sickness or injury  and• begins while this policy is in force  and• requires care by or at the direction of a legally qualified physician this physician must be someone other than the insured or a member of the insureds immediate family  and• reduces the insureds ability to work  and• causes a loss of earned income as discussed in this partthe repeated use of the coordinating conjunction “and” at the conclusion of the separate clauses limiting the scope of the term “incapacity” signals that an incapacity must be consistent with each of the five limitations before it can be considered a disability for the purposes of dr jeffersons policy   see sherman v reserve ins co 0 sod   fladistctapp  casteel v iowa dept of transp  nwd   iowa   see also blacks law dictionary  th ed0 defining “and” as a “conjunction connecting words or phrases expressing the idea that the latter is to be added to or taken along with the first”the policy further defines several of the key terms found in the clauses limiting the types of incapacity that will render a person disabled   a disability due to sickness is a “disability which results from or is contributed to by illness disease or bodily or mental infirmity”   a disability due to injury is a “disability which results from accidental bodily injury to the insured and which is not contributed to by illness disease or bodily or mental infirmity”not all persons who become ill or who are injured are entitled to disability benefits under dr jeffersons policy   in light of the policys definition of “disability” a person whose ability to work has been reduced because of a sickness or injury is not entitled to monthly income payments unless the sickness or injury has also caused a “loss of earned income”   the policy defines and explains the computation of the “loss of earned income”   it is essentially a monthly computation of the difference between  the monthly average of the insureds earned income before the sickness or injury  and  the amount of income the insured actually earns during a particular month following the illness or injury   however before an insured is entitled to disability benefits for a particular month the policy requires that his or her loss of earned income for that month be at least 0 of his or her average predisability income  in simple terms an insured is not entitled to a monthly disability payment unless his or her earned income for that month is at least 0 less than his predisability average earned income iiidr jeffersons disability claim we now turn to dr jeffersons disability claim   as the person seeking benefits dr jefferson had the burden of establishing that he had become incapacitated and that he was entitled to benefits under his disability policy   while the basis for dr jeffersons claim changed over time the trial court concluded that his “incapacity” beginning on april  0 was not caused by a disability due to sickness and that this incapacity had not resulted in a loss of earned income   we agreea dr jeffersons disability claim must be analyzed using one of the most basic principles of insurance law   this principle is that the insured has the burden of demonstrating that a covered loss has occurred0  pitman v blue cross blue shield  fd   0th cir  blaine constr corp v insurance co of n am  fd   th cir construing tennessee law  prudential ins co v

revere life ins co  fsuppd   dminn   accordingly from the outset of his claim dr jefferson had the burden of establishing that he had been disabled by an incapacity that satisfied his disability policys five requirementsbin his “statement of claimant” dated october  0 dr jefferson described the nature of his claimed sickness as “major depression following revocation of license”   he checked a box on the form indicating that this sickness did not occur at work   he also identified his sole treating physician was “wm hardin” and stated that dr hardin had treated him presumably for his “major depression” from june  0 to the present   when asked “how long were or will you be totally disabled” dr jefferson replied that he had been totally disabled from april  0 and that he did not know how long his disability would continuein addition to the information regarding the nature and treatment of his claimed sickness dr jefferson provided information regarding his earned income on the “statement of claimant” form   he estimated that his earned income for the twelve months immediately preceding the date of his disability april  0 had been 0 and that his earned income for the highest twentyfour months out of the last five years prior to his disability had been    he also stated that he had earned nothing for services rendered or work performed from april  0 to october  0in light of the information dr jefferson supplied to massachusetts mutual on october  0 his disability claim had three essential ingredients   first the incapacity that reduced his ability to work was his “major depression following the revocation of his license”   second that the incapacity for which he was seeking benefits began on april  0   third that the claimed incapacity has resulted in a  loss of earned income after april  0the complexion of dr jeffersons disability claim changed somewhat after massachusetts mutual pressed him for more information after receiving dr jeffersons october  0 claim form the company requested him to provide additional information including his  through  federal income tax returns his work activities after april  0 his job description the disciplinary proceedings before the licensing board and details of the treatment he had been receiving for depression   dr jefferson provided a great deal of additional information in response to these requests including his tax returns materials and transcripts from the disciplinary proceeding and treatment notes from the professionals whom he had consultedin his responses dr jefferson revealed for the first time that dr richard had treated him for depression from may  through may    he did not explain why he had not listed dr richard on his october  0 “statement of claimant”  or why he had stated that his depression had caused his incapacity in april 0 rather than in may  when he first sought treatment from dr richard   the essence of the information provided by dr richard was that dr jefferson was suffering from “major depression” when he first sought treatment in may    dr richard could not identify precisely when this “major depression” had started but believed that it was the result of cumulative stresses at home and at work including jane roes complaint to the licensing board   dr richard had also determined that dr jefferson had had dysthymia  since childhood or adolescence and that he also had a personality disorder the information dr jefferson provided massachusetts mutual demonstrated  that he had not missed work from  through april  0  that he had continued to see patients up until the day that the licensing board revoked his license and  that prior to the administrative hearing he had made appointments to see patients during and after may 0   the records of the licensing boards proceedings revealed that dr jefferson had vigorously asserted throughout that he was a competent clinical psychologist that he should be permitted to continue to see patients and that the disciplinary proceedings had provided him with whatever rehabilitation he requireddr jeffersons federal income tax returns demonstrated that his gross business income had trended steadily upward during the five years from  to  and that his net business income showed a similar trend  his 0 tax return revealed a precipitous decline in net business income because he was required to close his practice following the revocation of his license in april 0 and his appointment books indicated that he saw fewer patients between january and march 0 than he had seen between january and march   notwithstanding the decrease in the number of patients he saw during the first four months of 0 dr jefferson reported gross business earnings of  in 0 before his license was revoked cdr jefferson takes issue with the trial courts conclusion that he had not “demonstrated a loss of income of at least twenty percent 0․” first he argues that it is uncontradicted that he has earned virtually nothing since the revocation of his license in april 0   second he asserts that his federal income tax returns do not paint an accurate picture of the services he performed each month or of his monthly billings prior to april 0 because they contained annualized information and because there was a lag time between when he rendered the services and when his patients paid for themdr jeffersons first point is welltaken   there can be no reasonable dispute that for every month following april 0 he has earned at least twenty percent less than his preapril 0 average monthly income   thus the trial courts conclusion regarding dr jeffersons loss of income after april 0 is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence   dr jeffersons undisputed testimony establishes that he has not practiced psychology since april 0 and that he has earned relatively modest amounts from a patent on a mechanical checklist device for pilots and from working as an ariel photographer a landscaper and in mortgage sales   it also establishes that he has consistently earned less than eighty percent of his preapril 0 average monthly income from these activitieswe fail to see the relevance of dr jeffersons second point   while dr jefferson like many other professionals may very well have been paid for his services months after he rendered them this fact adds little support for his postapril 0 disability claim   he has already established that he provided no psychological services after april  0   it is therefore irrelevant that he would have been paid months later for his services had he provided them   for our purposes the relevant facts are  that dr jefferson provided no professional services after april  0  that he earned no income from professional services after that date and  that his earned income in any month following april  0 has as far as this record shows never exceeded eighty percent of his preapril 0 average monthly incomethis point might conceivably be relevant were dr jefferson seeking disability benefits for some period prior to april  0   however he is not   his october  0 “statement of claimant” pinpoints the beginning date of his disability as april  0   it necessarily follows that if dr jefferson insists that his disability began on april  0 he could not possibly be seeking disability benefits for any period prior to that date   therefore the circumstances surrounding the payments dr jefferson received for professional services rendered before april  0 is essentially irrelevant to his claim involving a postapril 0 disabilitydthe fact that dr jeffersons postapril 0 monthly income has never exceeded eighty percent of his preapril 0 average monthly income does not by itself entitle the doctor to draw disability   to be entitled to disability benefits under his policy he must also demonstrate that the decline in his monthly income was caused by an incapacity that was “due to sickness or injury”   for the purpose of dr jeffersons policy the term “sickness” includes a “mental infirmity”the record establishes that dr jefferson has or had at least three mental infirmitiesdysthymia a narcissistic personality disorder and “major depression”   dr jeffersons depression is the only one of the three that could possibly support a disability claim because its onset occurred after the effective date of his policy  however dr jeffersons “major depression” will not support his disability claim unless he can also demonstrate  that it caused his incapacity to work and  that it would have prevented him from practicing as a clinical psychologist even if his license had not been suspendeddr jefferson is not the first professional who has sought disability benefits following the revocation or suspension of a professional license   when called upon to review these claims the courts have distinguished between persons who are unable to engage in their profession and those who are not allowed to do so  new york life ins

disability over another type”   however dr jefferson was obliged to demonstrate that his mental infirmity whatever it may be actually hindered his ability to practice psychology depression qualifies as a mental infirmity under dr jeffersons disability policy   there are however different levels of depression and not all levels of depression impair a persons ability to practice his or her profession   while dr jefferson demonstrated that he was to some degree depressed as early as may  he was not entitled to disability benefits until he demonstrated that his depression became so severe that it reduced his ability to work   this is precisely where his case falls shortinitially dr jefferson pinpointed april  0 as the day on which his depression became so severe that it disabled him from practicing as a clinical psychologist   this date was two days after the licensing board had decided to revoke his license   both dr jeffersons physician and the psychiatrist retained by massachusetts mutual to review dr jeffersons claim agreed that the loss of a professional license could trigger a disabling depression   dr hardin stated that dr jefferson was neither mentally nor physically capable of practicing psychology immediately after the revocation of his license   dr kenner agreed that the loss of dr jeffersons license “must have been a significant blow to his overinflated ego”dr jefferson however shifted the onset of his depression sometime after he submitted his disability claim   he may very well have realized that postlicense revocation depression would most likely not warrant the payment of disability benefits   instead of claiming that his disability was caused by a depression triggered by the loss of his license he asserted that the onset of his disabling depression occurred at least three years before be lost his license and that he had in fact been “very impaired” since    these assertions have two significant shortcomings   first dr jeffersons treating professionals declined to state categorically that his depression whenever its onset had rendered him incapable of practicing psychology prior to may 0   second dr jefferson proved by his own conduct that his depression had not prevented him from continuing to practice psychology until the day the licensing board revoked his licensedr richard the clinical psychologist who treated dr jefferson from may  to may  stated that he had diagnosed dr jefferson with a major depression   while he could not determine precisely when this depression began he stated that its onset was before may  and that it was the result of the cumulative effects of various stresses in dr jeffersons life including the regulatory threat to his license   dr richard agreed that psychologists can continue to function with stresses similar to those experienced by dr jefferson but added that they do not function well   based on the information provided by dr jefferson dr richard determined that dr jefferson had become “somewhat dysfunctional in his professional life as well as his home life and personal life”   he concluded that dr jeffersons “function would begin to fall off” whenever he “felt that the stress level was supremely high”   while dr richard stated on several occasions that dr jeffersons depression “contributed to him making poor decisions and judgments” he never stated that depression prevented dr jefferson from practicing psychology   in fact despite diagnosing dr jefferson with a major depression and personality disorder dr richard insisted that dr jefferson was “a very compassionate person who cares about people” and also stated “i dont know that hes not a good therapist”dr hardin was the only physician who treated dr jefferson for depression   he began treating dr jefferson in june 0 and stated unequivocally that dr jefferson was mentally and physically incapable of practicing psychology after he lost his license in april 0   however dr hardin was far less certain about dr jeffersons circumstances prior to the loss of his license   he conceded that he lacked personal knowledge regarding dr jeffersons ability to discharge the duties and responsibilities of a clinical psychologist from  through early 0   while he surmised that dr jefferson was “probably” not capable of practicing psychology prior to june 0 he admitted that he could not “judge” whether dr jeffersons depression actually affected his workdr kenner the psychiatrist retained by massachusetts mutual to evaluate dr jeffersons disability claim stated that dr jefferson was depressed prior to april 0 but that he was not so depressed that he was unable to work   he concluded that the loss of his license was a “significant blow” to dr jefferson and that dr jefferson did not have a major depressive disorder until he lost his license   dr kenner opined that dr jeffersons longstanding personality disorder not his depression was the root cause of the conduct that had precipitated the disciplinary proceedings against him   and like dr richard dr kenner concluded that none of dr jeffersons mental infirmities were compulsive disordersthe evidence regarding the nature of dr jeffersons practice most of which dr jefferson himself provided undermines his claim that a major depression had already impaired his ability to practice psychology by the time the licensing board revoked his license in april 0   dr jefferson testified that he had been actively practicing psychology since    his annual billings and gross income had increased steadily every year even after  the year in which dr jefferson claimed that his “major depression” had rendered him “very impaired”   by all accounts the nature of dr jeffersons practice remained essentially unchanged until early 0dr jefferson conceded that he would have continued to practice psychology had the licensing board not revoked his license in april 0   he insisted throughout the administrative and judicial proceedings involving his license that he was not impaired and that he had done nothing unethical enough to justify revoking his license he continued to see patients until the very day his license was revoked and had even been setting appointments during the month following the anticipated licensing boards hearing   dr jefferson also acknowledged that he would have continued to see patients had the board decided not to revoke his licensethe timing and circumstances of dr jeffersons treatment for depression likewise undermine his claim that it significantly affected his ability to practice psychology   despite his assertion that he had been suffering with a major depression since  he did not seek another psychologists assistance until may  shortly after jane roe filed her complaint against him with the licensing board   when he did consult another clinical psychologist he chose one who lacked experience or expertise in treating psychologists or other professionals accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with clients or former clients   similarly dr jefferson did not seek a physicians assistance for his depression until june 0 three years after its claimed onset but a little more than one month after the licensing board revoked his license   dr jeffersons expressed purpose for seeking his physicians assistance according to the physicians treatment notes was to discuss “going on disability because of depression”dr jefferson concedes as he must that he would not have stopped practicing psychology had the license board not forced him to   however he asserts that he successfully demonstrated that his preapril 0 depression had impaired his ability to practice   in this regard he points to the evidence  that he was in denial about his problems prior to april 0  that the number of patients he was seeking declined markedly beginning in january 0 and  that the quality of his work had declined   we have determined that each of these facts even if true do not necessarily prove that dr jefferson was unable to function as a clinical psychologist prior to the revocation of his licensedr jefferson insisted throughout the proceedings before the licensing board that he was “a highly qualified and competent psychologist”   however to bolster his disability claim he downplays these assertions by insisting that he was in denial prior to april 0 and that he began to overcome this denial only after the licensing board revoked his license   while drs harding and richard corroborated dr jeffersons claim that he had been in denial much of the force of the denial argument is undercut by the fact that dr jefferson never conceded to the licensing board that he had been impaired in any way and never acted as if he had become more selfaware after the revocation of his license   ten months after losing his license dr jefferson personally proclaimed to the licensing board “i am so rehabilitated that it is almost beyond description”   throughout the lengthy judicial proceedings to review the licensing boards decision that lasted until december  dr jefferson never departed from his insistence that he was fully competent to practice psychology   the force of the denial argument is also undercut by the concessions of drs hardin and richard that psychologists with depression are not necessarily incapable of practicing psychologydr jefferson also relies on his testimony that he saw far fewer patients during the first three months of 0 than he did during the same period in    even if this evidence is true it does not necessarily establish that dr jefferson treated fewer patients in 0 because he was unable to treat more   the decline in his patient base could very well have been caused by other external factors not related to his ability to practice psychology such as increased competition from other psychologists or the spreading awareness in the community where he practiced of his disciplinary problems with the licensing boardthe decline in the number of dr jeffersons patients could also have been caused by concerns on the part of referring physicians about the efficacy of his therapy   the record contains anecdotal evidence that dr jefferson may have been inappropriately impatient distracted or preoccupied during several therapy sessions with several of his patients   however dr jefferson never conceded that his treatment of any patient was improper and there is no evidence that his impatience distraction or preoccupation prevented him from competently treating his patients   disability insurance policies are not malpractice policies and do not insure against the risk that an otherwise competent professional might render service in a particular case that falls below the prevailing standard of care   competency is not inexorably linked with capacity   accordingly the anecdotal evidence of isolated therapeutic lapses does not establish that dr jeffersons ability to render acceptable psychological services was impaired prior to the revocation of his licensewe have in this case not an appeal from a summary judgment but an appeal from a trial courts considered decision following a bench trial   the trial court heard all the testimony reviewed the exhibits and assessed the credibility of the witnesses called both by dr jefferson and by massachusetts mutual   after weighing all the evidence the trial court concluded that dr jefferson had failed to demonstrate that his depression had actually impaired his ability to practice psychology before the licensing board revoked his license in april 0   the evidence as we see it supports this conclusion   accordingly the record demonstrates that dr jeffersons postapril 0 loss of income was not due to his depression but rather to the loss of his license   because the loss of his license was a legal disability not covered by his disability insurance policy dr jefferson is not entitled to disability benefitsivmassachusetts mutuals claim for discretionary costsmassachusetts mutual takes issue with the trial courts denial of its motion for 0 in discretionary costs   it asserts that the trial court erred because it had prevailed in the declaratory judgment action it was required to file to address dr jeffersons claim   we have determined that the trial court erred by declining to grant  in covered discretionary costs that appear to be necessary and reasonableafollowing the entry of the judgment declaring that dr jefferson was not entitled to disability payments massachusetts mutual moved to assess 0 in discretionary costs against dr jefferson under tenn r civ p 0   massachusetts mutual itemized these costs in an affidavit attached to its motion   these costs included    for court reporter fees  0 for dr kenners fees  0 representing dr hardins fee to attend his deposition   for dr richards court appearance   for dr bill phofl  0 for the services of dr prudence l orr  0 for the services of dr c dawne kimbrell   for copying and for court documents and   for dr orrs airfaredr jefferson responded that the requested costs should be disallowed because their amount was “exorbitant” and “outrageously unreasonable”   he insisted that dr kenners fee was “ridiculous” and that it should be disallowed because dr kenner “only testified at trial and he never evaluated the defendant neither was his deposition taken” and because the trial court had not accepted dr kenners testimony   in more general terms he argued that massachusetts mutual was not entitled to costs under tenn r civ p 0 because it had initiated the suit and because “in view of defendant losing his license to practice psychology the requiring of him to pay this amount will work an undue financial burden on him in that he is earning his income from mowing lawns”bthe courts exist in our society to resolve disputes that the parties themselves cannot resolve   while the courts strive to secure a just speedy and inexpensive determination of every dispute brought before them it is an inescapable modern reality that obtaining a judicial resolution of a dispute can be costly and timeconsuming   all too frequently the parties who prevail in litigation are not made whole because their litigation expenses erode the economic value of their recovery many judicial systems have allocated the increasing costs of litigation by embracing the principle of loser pays all   american courts however have continued to require as a general matter each party to be responsible for its own litigation expenses   thus the american rule requires litigants to pay their own attorneys fees in the absence of a statute or contractual provision otherwise  state v brown  williamson tobacco corp  swd   tenn  john kohl  co v dearborn  ewing  swd   tenn   litigants are also required to underwrite the costs of preparing for trial   traditionally the only litigationrelated costs that a losing party was expected to pay were the statutory costs taxed by the trial court clerk  tenn r civ p 0tennessees courts have recognized several modest exceptions to the traditional rules governing the allocation of litigation expenses   these exceptions stem from a desire to make the prevailing party whole  scholz v sb intl inc  swd   tennctapp   thus even in the absence of a statute or contract we have recognized that losing defendants in slander of title actions should be required to pay the prevailing plaintiffs legal expenses  ezell v graves  swd  0 tennctapp0   for similar reasons the tennessee supreme court has promulgated tenn r civ p 0 that permits the courts to require losing parties to pay certain other litigation expenses incurred by the prevailing partythe passage of time has obscured tenn r civ p 0s history   it was first promulgated by the tennessee supreme court on january   and was intended to complement legislation that had been introduced in the tennessee general assembly amending tenncode ann § 0 to permit the courts to tax certain litigation expenses as costs  the legislation specifically empowered the court to tax as costs  court reporter expenses for depositions and trial the cost of transcripts the fees of courtappointed experts interpreters fees and the costs of charts and photographs  nancy f maclean  bradley a maclean rules of civil procedure annotated §  at  d edtenn r civ p 0s companion legislation stalled soon after it was referred to the senate and house judicial committees   on march   faced with the certainty that the general assembly could not enact the proposed amendments to tenncode ann § 0 the tennessee supreme court submitted a revised version of tenn r civ p 0 that omitted any reference to the amendment to tenncode ann § 0 that was then foundering in the legislature   ultimately the general assembly approved the revised version of tenn r civ p 0 even though it never enacted its companion legislation  thus as of august   tenn r civ p 0 read as followsa party who desires to recover discretionary costs or any recoverable costs not included in the bill of costs prepared by the clerk of the trial court shall move the court to assess discretionary costs and attach thereto an itemized and verified bill of costs   the affidavit shall be made by the party or his duly authorized attorney or agent having knowledge of the facts certifying that such items of costs are accurate and were reasonable and necessary to preparation and trial of the case and that the services for which such fees have been charged were actually performed   the motion shall be filed as a posttrial motion pursuant to rule 0 the watershed event that shaped the current understanding of tenn r civ p 0 was lock v national union fire ins co  swd  tenn   in that case the tennessee supreme court approved the trial courts use of tenn r civ p 0 to award a prevailing plaintiff  the court reporters appearance fees for the depositions and trial  the court reporters transcription costs and  the fees charged by the expert witnesses for appearance at their depositions  lock v national union fire ins co  swd at  n  noting that the case was its first opportunity to construe tenn r civ p 0 the court explained that “it was our intent that reasonable and necessary costs in the preparation and trial of a case could be assessed as discretionary costs by the trial court”  lock v national union fire ins co  swd at 0in  following the lock decision the tennessee supreme court amended tenn r civ p 0 to more precisely define the types of costs that could be recovered and to require that motions seeking these costs must be filed and served within thirty days after entry of the judgment  tenn r civ p  adv commn cmt to  amend   following other amendments in  and  tenn r civ p 0 now provides in partcosts not included in the bill of costs prepared by the clerk are allowable only in the courts discretion   discretionary costs allowable are  reasonable and necessary court reporter expenses for depositions or trials reasonable and necessary expert witness fees for depositions or trials reasonable and necessary interpreter fees for depositions or trials and guardian ad litem fees  travel expenses are not allowable discretionary costs awarding costs in accordance with tenn r civ p 0 like awarding other costs is within the trial courts reasonable discretion   perdue v green branch mining co  swd  0 tenn   accordingly we employ a deferential standard when reviewing a trial courts decision either to grant or to deny motions to assess these costs  scholz v sb intl inc  swd at    because these decisions are discretionary we are generally disinclined to secondguess a trial courts decision unless the trial court has abused its discretion  woodlawn meml park inc v keith 0 swd   tenn  stalsworth v grummons  swd   tennctapp  mitchell v smith  swd   tennctapp the “abuse of discretion” standard of review calls for less intense appellate review and therefore less likelihood that the trial courts decision will be reversed  state ex rel jones v looper  swd   tennctapp  white v vanderbilt univ  swd   tennctapp   appellate courts do not have the latitude to substitute their discretion for that of the trial court  myint v allstate ins co 0 swd 0  tenn  state ex rel vaughn v kaatrude  swd   tennctapp   thus a trial courts discretionary decision will be upheld as long as it is not clearly unreasonable bogan v bogan 0 swd   tenn and reasonable minds can disagree about its correctness  eldridge v eldridge  swd   tenn  state v scott  swd   tenn   discretionary decisions must however take the applicable law and the relevant facts into account  ballard v herzke  swd   tenn   accordingly a trial court has “abused its discretion” when it applies an incorrect legal standard reaches a decision that is illogical bases its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence or employs reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining party  woodlawn meml park inc v keith 0 swd at   clinard v blackwood  swd   tenn  wilder v wilder  swd   tennctapp  robinson v clement  swd   tennctapp parties are not entitled to costs under tenn r civ p 0 simply because they prevail at trial  sanders v gray  swd   tennctapp   the particular equities of the case may influence a trial courts decision about these costs  perdue v green branch mining co  swd at 0  stalsworth v grummons  swd at    however the courts should as a general matter award discretionary costs to a prevailing party if the costs are reasonable and necessary and if the prevailing party has filed a timely and properly supported motion  scholz v sb intl inc  swd at  a nonspecific antipathy toward awarding discretionary costs under tenn r civ p 0 appears to continue in some quarters of tennessees judiciary   it is not an easy undertaking to reconcile cases upholding the denial of discretionary costs with other cases affirming the award of similar costs based on essentially similar facts   even though the decisions regarding these costs are “discretionary” a trial courts decision should be guided by the language of tenn r civ p 0 itself and the policies that led to the rules enactment  stalsworth v grummons  swd at    thus when deciding whether to award discretionary costs under tenn r civ p 0 the courts should  determine whether the party requesting the costs is the “prevailing party”   limit awards to the costs specifically identified in the rule  determine whether the requested costs are necessary and reasonable and  determine whether the prevailing party has engaged in conduct during the litigation that warrants depriving it of the discretionary costs to which it might otherwise be entitled0  the courts should not however base their decisions to award costs under tenn r civ p 0 on  a desire to punish the losing party  whether the prevailing party is the plaintiff or defendant or  the weight given to a particular witnesss testimony  the party seeking to recover its costs under tenn r civ p 0 has the burden of demonstrating that it is entitled to recover these costs  stalsworth v grummons  swd at    as a general matter a party seeking these costs must file a timely motion and must support this motion with an affidavit detailing these costs verifying that they are accurate and that they have actually been charged and that they are necessary and reasonable   once a party seeking costs under tenn r civ p 0 has filed its motion the nonmoving party may present evidence and argument challenging the requested costs   the party who takes issue on appeal with a trial courts decision regarding discretionary costs has the burden of showing how the trial court abused its discretion  sanders v gray  swd at  proceedings involving discretionary costs like proceedings involving requested attorneys fees are frequently decided on affidavits and argument of counsel in light of the entire record   parties rarely seek contested hearings on requests for discretionary costs and thus do not commonly present evidence beyond their competing affidavits   thus fully developed records of contested proceedings involving costs under tenn r civ p 0 are rare and are certainly not required to enable the trial court or an appellate court for that matter to review a claim for discretionary costs   in cases where the issue of discretionary costs has been decided on affidavits and the record of the entire proceeding without the presentation of new evidence specifically pertaining to the disputed costs themselves the trial courts decision can effectively be reviewed without a transcript of the hearing on the tenn r civ p 0 motion   accordingly parties challenging a trial courts decision regarding discretionary costs are not necessarily required to submit a transcript of the hearing on discretionary costs in order to raise the issue on appeal cthe trial courts order denying massachusetts mutuals motion for discretionary costs does not state that the court heard additional evidence regarding discretionary costs at its january   hearing   it states simply that the motion was decided on the “entire record” the “motion to assess discretionary costs and supporting pleadings of ․ massachusetts mutual life insurance company” the “statement of counsel” and the “filings in support of or in opposition to the pending postjudgment motions”   this recitation leaves no room for reasonable doubt that the parties did not present additional evidence regarding massachusetts mutuals request for discretionary costs at the january   hearing   accordingly having a transcript of this hearing is not necessary to enable us to effectively review the trial courts decision to deny discretionary costs in this case massachusetts mutual is clearly the prevailing party in this case it convinced the trial court to declare that it was not contractually obligated to pay dr jefferson disability benefits   it also convinced the trial court to dismiss dr jeffersons counterclaim   the company also filed a timely and properly supported motion seeking discretionary costs   likewise the voluminous record contains no evidence that the company engaged in the sort of conduct during the litigation that would disentitle it to recover its costs   thus based on the record as a whole we have concluded that massachusetts mutual is entitled to recover its expenses that qualify as discretionary costs and that these expenses are necessary and reasonablebased on its affidavit massachusetts mutual is entitled to  for its court reporter fees 0 for dr hardins fee to appear at his discovery deposition and  for dr richards fee for appearing at trial   by the same token massachusetts mutual clearly is not entitled to  for dr orrs travel expenses because tenn r civ p 0 explicitly excludes them   the company is likewise not entitled to the claimed  in document expenses because they are not among the types of expenses listed in tenn r civ p 0 that qualify as discretionary costs   thus the only remaining disputed costs are the 0 in expert witness fees claimed by massachusetts mutual including dr kenners 0 fee tenn r civ p 0 limits the types of expenses related to expert witnesses that can be recovered as discretionary costs   only “reasonable and necessary expert witness fees for depositions and trial” are recoverable   thus prevailing parties cannot recover expert witness fees for preparing for depositions or trial no matter how reasonable and necessary these fees are  miles v marshall c voss health care ctr  swd   tenn permitting the recovery of a vocational experts witness fee but not the fee charged to examine the plaintiff  crawford v dodson no w0coarcv  wl  at  tennctapp aug  no tenn rapp p

at  tenn sp workers comp panel dec   or for appearances at depositions for proof when the expert also testifies at trial  seals v englandcorsair upholstery mfg co  swd   tenn   prevailing parties may however be able to recover the standby fees charged by expert witnesses who were required to be on call but who were not called because of some act attributable to the nonprevailing party  stalsworth v grummons  swd at the record contains little information regarding the nature of the services provided by drs kenner kimbrell orr and pfohl other than the dates on which the services were rendered and the fees charged for the services   the affidavit supporting massachusetts mutuals motion to assess discretionary costs does not explain the nature or purposes of these services   other parts of the record including dr jeffersons response to massachusetts mutuals motion establish that dr kenner was not deposed but that he testified at trial on november    that dr pfohl was never deposed and did not testify at trial  and that neither dr orr nor dr kimbrell testified at trial even though one of them was apparently deposed massachusetts mutual as the party seeking discretionary costs had the burden of demonstrating that it should be reimbursed for the costs associated with its experts   in light of the nature of dr jeffersons disability claim it was certainly appropriate for massachusetts mutual to decide to present expert testimony regarding dr jeffersons mental infirmities and their effect on his ability to practice psychology   however massachusetts mutual was still obliged to demonstrate that the claimed fees for these experts were necessary and reasonable and were limited to fees charged for appearing at a deposition or trial the record contains only sketchy information regarding drs kimbrell orr and pfohl   it provides no factual basis for concluding that their services whatever they may have been were necessary and reasonable rather than duplicative of dr kenners services   it also provides no basis for determining that their claimed fees were limited to fees charged for appearing at trial or at a deposition   accordingly massachusetts mutual has not demonstrated that it is entitled to reimbursement for the expenses associated with these three experts dr kenner testified at trial   despite the trial courts opinion regarding the value of his testimony presenting expert evidence regarding dr jeffersons mental infirmities and their effect on his ability to practice psychology was necessary and reasonable   however massachusetts mutual is not entitled to recover any of dr kenners fees as discretionary costs for two reasons   first much of his fee plainly involved nonrecoverable trial preparation services   second the affidavit supporting the motion to assess discretionary costs does not identify which of dr kenners many fees represented his fee for attending the trial   accordingly massachusetts mutual has failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to reimbursement for any portion of dr kenners feesvwe affirm the trial courts conclusion that dr jefferson has failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to benefits under massachusetts mutuals disability policy   we vacate the order denying massachusetts mutuals motion to assess discretionary costs and remand the case to the trial court with directions to enter

noting that dr jefferson told ms roe in early  that he was being investigated for potential ethical violations stemming from an affair with a former patient in    the board of examiners of psychology eventually directed dr jefferson to conduct research and write four papers addressing intimate relationships with former patients   dr jefferson later confided to another clinical psychologist that he had had affairs with four former patients   ms roe also filed a medical malpractice case against dr jefferson on february  0 which was subsequently dismissed as untimely  roe v jefferson  swd

with his father  his extramarital affairs and  the threat of disciplinary proceedings   jefferson v board of examiners in psychology no ii davidson ch december     apparently the licensing board did not appeal the chancery courts decision   the policy itself recites that “this policy is a legal contract between the owner and us   the entire contract consists of the policy which includes any attached papers and endorsements”   accordingly the trial court correctly determined that the promotional materials dr jefferson received from massachusetts mutual prior to applying for insurance were not part of the insurance contract   for the purposes of establishing the monthly average of an insureds income before the disability began the policy selects the higher of  the average of the insureds income for the twelve months before the disability began or  the average of the insureds highest income for any consecutive  month period during the five years before the disability began   dr jeffersons policy provides that a reduction in earned income will not qualify as a “loss of earned income” unless it is at least  of the insureds average predisability income   however sometime after the policy was issued massachusetts mutual liberalized this condition by decreasing the  threshold to 0   the policy contains the following example explaining this computationthe monthly average of your earned income before you became disabled was    now your disability prevents you from earning that amount   for any month that you can earn 0 your loss of earned income is  or 0   for any month that you can earn  your loss is less than  and there is no loss of earned income for the purpose of this policy   for any month that you can earn only  your loss exceeds  and the loss of earned income is considered to be   italics in the policyafter massachusetts mutuals liberalization of the minimum loss of earned income requirement from  to 0 the  loss of earned income in this example would in fact qualify as a loss of earned income because it amounts to at least 0 of the insureds average predisability income0   two corollaries to this principle are  that an insurance company has the burden of proving that an exclusion in its policy applies to a claim interstate life  accident ins co v gammons  tennapp    swd    and  that once an insurance company demonstrates that an exclusion applies the burden shifts to the insured to demonstrate that its claim fits within an exception to the exclusion  standard fire ins co v chester odonley  assocs  swd at    perhaps dr jefferson did not identify dr richard on the october  0 form because it asked only for a list of “treating physicians”   dr richard was a clinical psychologist not a physician   in common parlance a physician is a person who possesses a medical degree   this common understanding generally comports with the words technical meaning   for licensing purposes a “physician” is a person who is licensed pursuant to either chapter  or chapter  of title  of the tennessee code tenncode ann § 0df supp   chapters  and  apply to persons with a medical degree or a degree from a school of osteopathic medicine   psychologists are not licensed under chapters  or  but rather under chapter    dr richard described dysthymia as a “low grade of depression” that does not necessarily interfere with a persons functioning   in his words persons with dysthymia “keep going but they are not actualizing their potential or having a lot of fun in life”   he also stated that dr jeffersons dysthymia had probably begun in childhood or adolescence   clearly dr jeffersons dysthymia did not bring about an incapacity under his disability policy because  it began before the policy was in force  it had not reduced his ability to work and  it had not caused a “loss of earned income”   while dr richard declined to specifically characterize dr jeffersons personality disorder he determined that dr jefferson had a “sexual addiction”   dr william kenner classified dr jeffersons condition as a “narcissistic personality disorder” that caused dr jefferson to lack “the moral courage to tell himself no when it comes to having sex with patients”   both drs richards and kenner stated that dr jeffersons personality disorder had been in place since childhood or adolescence   accordingly like his dysthymia dr jeffersons personality disorder was not a “mental infirmity” that caused an incapacity under his disability policy because  it began before the policy was in force and  it had not reduced his ability

corporation “afc” allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company “afliac” collectively “allmerica” and frederick h eppinger jr submit this memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ class action complaint the “complaint” for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under federal rule of civil procedure b introduction plaintiffs are three former allmerica agents who allege that they entered into an oral contract with afc andor afliac in september  which provided that they would receive “ commissions” for selling “nonproprietary products” ie life insurance and annuities administered by a company other than allmerica plaintiffs claim that allmerica paid  commissions from october   through november   but then stopped doing so for “replacement” sales whereby allmerica products were exchanged for nonproprietary products and allege that defendants attempted to recoup some commissions that had been paid previously plaintiffs bring claims for breach of contract and a violation of the pennsylvania wage payment and collection law “wage act” both claims fail as a matter of law specifically plaintiffs’ claims are preempted by the securities litigation uniform standards act “slusa”  usc §§ pb bbf because this court already has ruled in denying plaintiffs’ motion to remand that this is a “covered class action” under the statute even if slusa did not apply the statute of frauds bars plaintiffs’ attempt to sue for breach of an oral contract plaintiffs cannot state a wage act claim because as “independent contractors” they lack standing and in any event such a claim requires plaintiffs to plead an enforceable employment contract not an unenforceable oral agreement as set forth below the court should dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint with prejudice    case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  allegations of complaint afc and afliac are delaware corporations with offices located in worcester massachusetts compl ¶  frederick h eppinger is the president and chief executive officer “ceo” of afc id ¶  plaintiffs are former financial advisors of allmerica who provided financial planning services for their clients and “marketed and sold a variety of allmerica annuity insurance and investment products to clients” for which they were paid a commission based on the total dollar value of the sale id ¶¶     as allmerica agents plaintiffs sold both “proprietary products” which were annuities and life insurance policies administered by allmerica and “non proprietary products” which were annuities and life insurance products administered by a company other than allmerica id ¶¶  when plaintiffs sold a nonproprietary product the company administering that product paid a commission to allmerica and allmerica historically paid  of that commission to the agent responsible for the nonproprietary sale and retained the balance of  id ¶  plaintiffs allege that during a september  meeting the managing director of allmerica’s pittsburgh office announced that effective october   allmerica would pay agents in the pittsburgh region  of the commissions up from  for their sales of non proprietary variable annuities and life insurance the “ commission arrangement” id ¶ 0 plaintiffs also allege that the  commission arrangement was “announced” in emails conference calls and individual meetings id ¶  plaintiffs claim that over the next six weeks until november   they arranged for many of their existing variable life and annuity customers to replace their existing proprietary  for purposes of this motion only defendants recite the factual allegations set forth in the complaint see fed r civ p b in so doing defendants admit neither the veracity of plaintiffs’ allegations nor their relevance    case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  products with allmerica with nonproprietary products with other companies and that allmerica paid  commissions on those transactions id ¶¶   however plaintiffs claim that on november   allmerica terminated the  commission arrangement on the replacement business ie transfers of allmerica accounts to nonproprietary accounts retroactive two weeks to november   id ¶¶  plaintiffs further allege that allmerica attempted to recoup some of the commissions paid to plaintiffs under the  commission arrangement during those weeks by deducting amounts from commissions that otherwise would have been paid to plaintiffs id ¶¶  on may   plaintiffs filed this lawsuit purportedly on behalf of a putative class of allmerica agents who sold nonproprietary products through allmerica between october   and november   pursuant to the  commission arrangement and  did not receive the commissions to which they claim they were entitled  were required to return their commissions or  had their commissions “charged back” against their trail commissions id ¶  in count i plaintiffs allege that allmerica breached a “contract” by attempting recoup commissions paid to plaintiffs pursuant to the  commission arrangement see id ¶¶   in count ii plaintiffs allege that allmerica and mr eppinger violated the pennsylvania wage payment and collection law  pa cons stat § 0 et seq see id ¶¶  argument i plaintiffs’ state law claims are preempted by slusa the complaint should be dismissed in its entirety because it asserts two purportedly state law claims that are preempted by slusa this court already has ruled that the complaint was properly removed to federal court under slusa because it “arises out of the sale of annuities and variable life insurance products both of which are ‘covered securities’ for purposes of the    case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  slusa” see order dated october   at  denying motion to remand that order also compels dismissal because the scope of slusa preemption is identical to that for removal see  usc §§ pc bbf see also  usc §§ pb bbf “no covered class action    may be maintained in any state or federal court” simply put because this state law class action has been found to have been properly removed under slusa by definition it must be dismissed under slusa thereby leaving plaintiffs with whatever federal remedies they are entitled to assert see eg cape ann investors llc v lepone  f supp d  0 d mass 0 state claims dismissed under slusa “congress made federal court the exclusive venue” for class actions covered by slusa “by providing for removal of state actions to federal court and requiring the immediate dismissal of ‘covered lawsuits’” quoting riley v merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc  fd   th cir  emphasis supplied winne v equitable life assurance soc’y  f supp d   sdny 0 granting motion to dismiss “because the removal and dismissal provisions of slusa are intertwined once the court determines that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists pursuant to the statute it is a short step to dismissal of the statelaw claims” emphasis supplied araujo v john hancock life ins  f supp d  0 edny  granting motion to dismiss “slusa directs the removal and dismissal of class actions” within its scope emphasis supplied  plaintiffs cannot relitigate the court order that held that each of the elements required for slusa removal and dismissal has been satisfied see davis v dawson inc  f supp d   d mass  under law of the case doctrine “once a court decides upon a rule of law that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case” in any event the order is correct first this lawsuit is a “covered” class action compare  usc § bbfbiii “covered class action” includes any lawsuit in which “damages are sought on behalf of more than 0 persons or prospective class members” and order at  with compl ¶  “the class consists of hundreds of individuals” second both of plaintiffs’ claims were brought under state “statutory or common law” based at least in part on alleged misrepresentations and manipulation see order at  compl ¶¶ 0   third variable annuities and variable life insurance as a matter of law are “covered securities” under slusa see order at  citing lander v hartford life ins co  fd 0 d cir  dudek v prudential securities inc  fd  th cir  herndon v equitable variable life ins co  fd  th cir 0    case 0cvfds document  filed  page 0 of  ii plaintiffs’ claims would not survive dismissal even if they were not preempted by slusa a the statute of frauds bars plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim plaintiffs’ contract claim  an attempt to sue under an unwritten commission agreement   is barred by the massachusetts statute of frauds which specifically requires that any such agreements to compensate “brokers” be in writing any agreement to pay compensation for service as a broker or finder    shall be void and unenforceable unless such agreement is in writing signed by the party to be charged therewith or by some other person authorized     the provisions of this section shall apply to a contract implied in fact or in law to pay reasonable compensation but shall not apply to a contract to pay compensation for professional services as an attorneyatlaw or licensed real estate broker or real estate salesman acting in their professional capacity mass gen laws ch  §  emphasis supplied this “special business brokerage statute of frauds manifested a legislative purpose to discourage claims for commission based on conversations which persons heard differently or remembered differently” see alexander v berman  mass app ct   0 it “should be interpreted broadly to further its policy determination that agreements for compensation for certain services be in writing” see cantell v hill holiday connors cosmopulos  mass app ct 0   for this reason massachusetts courts dismiss lawsuits brought to enforce unwritten commission arrangements see eg north east tech sales inc v barshad no b  wl  at  mass super ct aug   dismissing breach of contract claim based on oral agreement to pay 0 sales commission as unenforceable under chapter  §  cox v thornton assocs inc no civ a 0  wl 0 at  mass super ct aug   dismissing breach of contract claim based on oral agreement to pay sales commissions as barred by chapter  §     case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  count i must be dismissed because chapter  §  forecloses plaintiffs’ attempt to sue for breach of an alleged oral contract to pay “ commissions” there is no question that plaintiffs are “brokers or finders” under chapter  §  a “broker” is “an agent who acts as an intermediary or negotiator especially between prospective buyers and sellers a person employed to make bargains and contracts between other persons in matters of trade commerce and navigation” cantell  mass app ct at  statutory term “broker” not a technical term and should be given ordinary meaning and construed according to common usage a “finder” is “an intermediary who brings together parties for a business opportunity” id at  plaintiffs plead themselves into the “broker or finder” definition they allegedly served as “intermediaries” between their clients who were prospective buyers of life insurance and annuities and allmerica which sold those products see eg compl ¶  alleging that plaintiffs “marketed and sold a variety of allmerica annuity insurance and investment products to clients” plaintiffs also allege that they “were compensated based upon a system comprised of commissions” calculated as a “percentage of the total dollar value of products purchased by the client” see id ¶¶   alleging that plaintiffs “paid commissions as a result of client’s purchasing annuities and life insurance policies mutual funds stock sales and other services” on similar allegations massachusetts courts have found plaintiffs to be “brokers or finders” under chapter  §  see cantell  mass app ct at  holding that employment agency was “broker” because “its claim for services is predicated upon its serving as an intermediary that was willing to negotiate an employment contract between employer and employment candidate” bay colony mktg co v fruit salad inc  mass app ct     “a finder differs from a brokerdealer because the finder merely brings two parties together to make their own contract while a brokerdealer usually participates in the negotiations a finder locates introduces and brings parties to a transaction together while a broker does more attempting to bring the parties to an agreement” see cantell  mass app at     case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  oral agreement for solicitation of new accounts and sales territories for seller’s food products in return for commission within statute of frauds alexander  mass app ct at  plaintiff who introduced defendant seller to potential buyer of business was “broker” it is equally clear that plaintiffs are suing to enforce an oral “contract” that even if it existed would be “void and unenforceable” under mass gen laws ch  §  plaintiffs contend that defendants contracted to pay  commissions ie “compensation” for their sales of nonproprietary products ie “services as a broker or finder” compl ¶ 0 yet nowhere does the complaint allege that any such deal was memorialized in a written contract signed by allmerica as required by chapter  §  to the contrary plaintiffs affirmatively allege that the supposed  commission arrangement was oral for example plaintiffs claim that defendants “announced the implementation” of the  commission arrangement at a meeting in september  and thereafter “promulgated and announced” the deal in unsigned and unidentified emails conference calls and individual meetings see compl ¶ 0 emphasis supplied ¶  this is not sufficient see north east tech sales  wl  at  dismissing contract claim under statute of frauds where as here complaint alleged that agreement was set forth in “various emails” and an unsigned draft of contract plaintiffs certainly have not satisfied the signed writing requirement by attaching to their complaint two unsigned documents that if anything demonstrate why ch  §  requires that commission agreements be in writing exhibit a is an email reminding recipients to attend a  significantly insurance agents and brokers do not fall within one of chapter  § ’s express statutory exceptions for “an attorneyatlaw or licensed real estate broker or real estate salesman” indeed the legislature’s inclusion of the express statutory exceptions “strengthens the inference that no other exception was intended” cantell  mass app ct at  emphasis supplied quoting protective life ins co v sullivan  mass  0  for this reason courts routinely dismiss contract claims brought by “brokers” and “finders” who  like plaintiffs here  do not fall within the statutory exceptions see eg cantell  mass app ct at  dismissing contract claim by employment agent who did not fall within any of the statutory exceptions bay colony  mass app ct at  food broker’s contract claim dismissed under chapter  §  no basis in statute to conclude that “legislature intended to obviate disputes over claimed commissions for services rendered in certain commercial brokerage contexts but not others”    case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  meeting and conference call at a local country club but says nothing about the supposed agreement upon which plaintiffs base their claim see compl ex a exhibit b is a letter to one plaintiff that references a commission chargeback but does not refer to any agreement to pay any particular amount of commissions much less any obligation by any defendant to pay  commissions on replacements of proprietary products with nonproprietary ones see compl ex b thus even taken together these documents do not approach an enforceable contract see christo v draper no p0  wl 0 at  mass app ct july   holding that two documents did not satisfy statute of frauds first document not in compliance where as here not signed or initialed by party second document not in compliance where as here it made no mention of any payment to plaintiff in exchange for finder services finally plaintiffs’ attempt to sue for breach of an alleged oral contract is particularly improper because they do not specify the party with whom they claim to have contracted they claim only to have been employed by “allmerica” a term they define in the complaint to include afc and afliac without ever identifying which entity allegedly was bound to and allegedly breached the  commission obligation see compl ¶  even under a rule a notice pleading standard plaintiffs are required to identify the party that is allegedly bound see orrell v umass mem med ctr inc  f supp d   d mass  dismissing breach of contract claim where plaintiff failed to allege privity of contract with defendants plaintiffs’ failure to plead the other side to the contract is also conspicuous because although they sued afc and afliac the documents they filed with the national association of    case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  securities dealers “nasd” identify neither as their employer but instead say they worked for allmerica investments inc which they have not sued b plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the pennsylvania wage act plaintiffs also fail to state a claim under the pennsylvania wage act count ii because plaintiffs i are not “employees” with standing to sue under the wage act and ii cannot reinvent an inactionable contract claim as one under the wage act  plaintiffs are not “employees” under the wage act plaintiffs cannot state a claim under the wage act because only “employees” have standing to sue under the statute and there are no factual allegations that they were employees of afi as opposed to afliac or of mr eppinger personally see  pa stat § 0aa plaintiffs’ bald assertion of having been “employees” of all defendants is inadequate see resolution trust co v driscoll  fd   st cir  affirming dismissal of complaint in passing on motion to dismiss although factual allegations are assumed to be true “this tolerance does not extend to legal conclusions or to bald assertions” although plaintiffs allegedly were allmerica agents and clearly are suing over a dispute that arises out of a master servant or “employment” relationship the wage act does not apply to all employment relationships  it only provides a remedy to those who were “employees” and excludes those who provided services as “independent contractors” see turk v communication design inc  as registered representatives licensed to sell securities such as variable annuities and life insurance plaintiffs are obligated to file public forms u and bd identifying their employer see  usc § o as a matter of law the court is entitled to consider publicly filed documents on a motion to dismiss see eg watterson v page  fd   st cir  district court properly considered public documents in granting motion to dismiss nasdcompiled information based on plaintiffs’ u and bd forms are attached hereto as exhibits a ries b murray and c henry  that is plaintiffs parrot the statute by referring to themselves as “employees” compl ¶  but nowhere is that assertion supported by factual allegations even under the liberal standard of fed r civ p a plaintiffs cannot satisfy their pleading burden with unsupported legal conclusions see united states ex rel karvelas v melrosewakefield hosp 0 fd 0  st cir  granting motion to dismiss “simply parroting the language of a statutory cause of action without some factual support is not sufficient to state a claim”    case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  0 pa d  cth   pa ct cm pleas  granting demurrer to plaintiff’s wage act claim where as here plaintiff was independent contractor and not defendant’s employee see also general electric co v lyon  f supp   d mass  granting motion to dismiss statutory counterclaim where as here defendant failed to allege facts that would support statute’s “critical elements” plaintiffs certainly cannot hide behind a boilerplate “employee” allegation now that in related litigation they denied they were “employees” but instead represented that they were “independent contractors” speakman v allmerica fin life ins  annuity co no civ 0 cvfds d mass pls’ mem in opp to mot to dismiss at  nor is this semantics courts have found that insurance agents like plaintiffs are independent contractors not employees see eg schweiger v farm bureau ins co of nebraska  fd 0 th cir  insurance agent held to be independent contractor knight v united farm bureau mut ins co 0 fd  th cir  same oestman v national farmers union ins co  fd  0th cir  same  plaintiffs cannot base a wage act claim on a void and unenforceable oral contract even if plaintiffs had standing to sue under the wage act count ii must be dismissed because they have failed to allege breach of an enforceable contract that is the pennsylvania wage act “does not create a right to compensation rather it provides a statutory remedy when the employer breaches a contractual obligation to pay earned wages the contract between the parties governs in determining whether specific wages are earned” weldon v kraft inc   thus the pennsylvania wage act is distinguished from mass gen laws ch a which excludes the entire universe of “employment relationships” and does not distinguish between “employee” and “independent contractor”  indeed even if “independent contractors” were deemed “employees” for purposes of the wage act as noted above plaintiffs never identified which of the two entities they sued employed them and have not sued the entity allmerica investments inc that they identified as their employer in the documents they filed with the nasd see exs a b c  0  case 0cvfds document  filed  page  of  fd  0 d cir 0 emphasis supplied affirming dismissal of wage act claim where as here there was no express contractual obligation to pay wages here plaintiffs transparently rely on their deficient breach of contract allegations see compl ¶  “by breaching its contracts with plaintiffs for commissions as outlined above defendants are in breach of the pennsylvania wage payment and collection law” plaintiffs cannot sue directly for breach of that “void and
