plaintiffappellant v wing shing products bvi ltd defendantcross appellant  decided august    before rader bryson and linn circuit judges bryson circuit judge appellant sunbeam products inc appeals from a decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york  br  affirming in part and reversing in part a decision of the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york  br  appellee wing shing products bvi ltd cross appeals we affirm  the appellee is one of a family of companies under common ownership and control we refer to them collectively and individually as “wing shing” l in june  john sham the president of wing shing approached jerry blackwell then a vicepresident of sunbeam’s predecessor a company known as mr coffee mr sham offered to manufacture coffeemakers for mr coffee and he provided mr blackwell with sketches of a design for the proposed coffeemaker in response to questions from mr blackwell mr sham provided a photograph of a wooden model of the coffeemaker between august  and early  employees of mr coffee had a series of communications with representatives of wing shing regarding the coffeemaker design in the course of those communications mr coffee employees asked that the design be changed by  eliminating grooves on the brew basket  eliminating ridges on the reservoir cover  moving the power switch from the base to the left column  opening the brew basket from the left to right  moving the waterlevel gauge from the right column to the left column  inserting a metal plate on the bottom of the base and  adding a shroud around the power switch wing shing incorporated those changes into the design which became known as the “ad” model design on june   mr coffee entered into an agreement with wing shing to purchase ad model coffeemakers from wing shing the agreement contained several clauses pertinent to this case it provided that  the agreement was to be effective between january   and december    “any and all existing patent rights for the units or any of its component parts shall be the sole and exclusive property andor responsibility of mr coffee” and  the parties would negotiate patent rights before applying for a patent on any jointly developed patentable items   after the execution of the agreement wing shing began to supply coffeemakers to mr coffee unbeknownst to mr coffee on july   mr sham filed a design patent application for the design of the ad coffeemaker listing himself as the sole inventor that patent issued on july   as us design patent no  “the ’ patent” wing shing did not mark the ad coffeemakers as being covered by a patent after the ’ patent issued however in november  mr coffee informed wing shing that simatelex manufactory co ltd was also producing the ad coffeemaker for mr coffee in march  wing shing sent a telefax message to mr coffee stating that it had no objection to mr coffee transferring the ad tooling to simatelex in that same telefax wing shing informed mr coffee that it had a design patent on the ad and therefore that it was entitled to sell the product to others although wing shing stated that the patent might result in business conflicts with mr coffee it never explicitly stated that mr coffee was infringing the ’ patent wing shing later conceded in the course of litigation that the march  telefax did not constitute notice of infringement of the design patent by  sunbeam had acquired mr coffee and had dramatically reduced the volume of ad coffeemakers it purchased from wing shing wing shing then filed a patent infringement claim against simatelex although sunbeam was in bankruptcy wing shing filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay in the sunbeam bankruptcy proceedings in response sunbeam sought enforcement of the automatic stay and commenced an adversary proceeding against wing shing in the bankruptcy court in that proceeding sunbeam contended that sunbeam was the exclusive owner of the ’ patent had an indefinite exclusive license to market and sell the ad   coffeemakers in certain markets and had the right to choose any manufacturer to supply the ad coffeemaker the bankruptcy court denied wing shing’s motion to lift the automatic stay and enjoined wing shing from pursuing the district court patent infringement claim against simatelex in the adversary proceeding wing shing filed an answer to sunbeam’s claims and counterclaimed asking the bankruptcy court to enter a judgment enjoining sunbeam from infringing the ’ patent and awarding wing shing damages for past infringement in a joint pretrial order the parties stipulated to the issues to be tried in that proceeding which included the issue of joint inventorship the bankruptcy court tried the case including the issues to which the parties stipulated in the pretrial order at the conclusion of the trial the court decided inter alia that  sunbeam was not a joint inventor of the ’ patent  wing shing was not barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from pursuing its infringement claim  wing shing did not breach the agreement to negotiate patent rights but even if it did sunbeam was barred by the statute of limitations from pursuing that claim  wing shing was barred by the doctrine of laches from claiming damages for presuit infringement  wing shing did not give sunbeam notice of infringement prior to filing suit and for that reason as well was barred from claiming damages for presuit infringement and  sunbeam was entitled to deduct certain expenses of its mr coffee line of products in calculating its profits on the products that incorporated the infringing design sunbeam appealed to the district court from the first three rulings and wing shing crossappealed from the other three the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court on all but two of the issues the district court did not reach the laches issue and   it disagreed with the bankruptcy court as to the breach of contract issue holding that wing shing had breached the agreement requiring it to negotiate patent rights on jointly developed patentable items the court concluded however that even though wing shing had breached the agreement sunbeam’s contractbased claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations ll we first address whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal wing shing argues that we do not have jurisdiction because sunbeam did not assert a joint inventorship claim or a claim requiring resolution of a substantial question of patent law sunbeam responds that jurisdiction in this court is proper because its complaint sought a declaration from the court that it owned the ’ patent or had an exclusive license based on the “course of conduct” of the parties sunbeam alleged in its complaint that the design in wing shing’s design patent “is the same as that contained in the mr coffee specifications” based on that allegation it argues that the “course of conduct” allegation incorporated a joint inventorship claim into the complaint in the alternative sunbeam maintains that the pretrial order which clearly contemplated that the court would resolve the joint inventorship question had the effect of amending its complaint to add a claim arising under the patent laws wing shing counters that the pretrial order did not in fact amend the complaint to include the issue of joint inventorship this court has jurisdiction under  usc §  when a district court had subject matter jurisdiction under  usc § a holmes group inc v vornado air circulation sys inc  us    section a provides subject matter jurisdiction if the complaint alleges a patent law claim or a claim that depends on   the resolution of a substantial question of patent law id at  see also christianson v colt indus operating corp  us    we agree with wing shing that sunbeam’s complaint by itself does not allege a patent law claim or a claim that depends on the resolution of a substantial question of patent law the complaint does not even mention joint inventorship but instead requests relief based on a contract claim the pretrial order however clearly identified the question whether mr coffee employees were joint inventors of the ’ patent as an issue to be tried by the court moreover the pretrial order stated that “the pleadings shall be deemed amended” to the extent necessary to allow wing shing to present its evidence at trial first thus the order which contemplated that joint inventorship was one of the issues in dispute effectively amended sunbeam’s complaint to the extent necessary to allow orderly presentation of the stipulated issues under these circumstances it is fair to interpret the pretrial order as constructively amending the complaint to add the claim of joint inventorship we have held that a district court “effected a constructive amendment of the complaint” when neither party objected to the district court adjudicating a joint inventorship claim that was not effectively pleaded in the plaintiff’s complaint eli lilly  co v aradigm corp  fd   fed cir  we have also held that “for the purpose of determining federal circuit jurisdiction we do not differentiate between actual and constructive amendments to the complaint” chamberlain group inc v skylink tech inc  fd   fed cir  because we interpret the complaint as amended by the pretrial order to raise the patent issue of joint inventorship we hold that we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal   lll with respect to the issue of joint inventorship sunbeam argues that because mr coffee’s employees suggested changes in the wing shing coffeemaker they are joint inventors of the ’ patent as a matter of law to support its argument sunbeam relies on pannu v iolab corp  fd  fed cir  in which we stated that “because it is undisputed that the invention was conceived while link and pannu were engaged in a collaborative enterprise and it is furthermore undisputed that pannu conceived significant aspects of the invention pannu is certainly at least a coinventor” id at  the bankruptcy court found however that “even if the court was to give weight to the overall appearance of the design patent including the wellknown concepts and functional aspects proposed by mr coffee the court finds that mr coffee’s contribution to the design patent was not significant in quality when measured against the dimension of the full invention” the district court upheld that finding holding that the bankruptcy court as factfinder was not clearly erroneous in concluding that mr coffee employees were not joint inventors inasmuch as the patented design was “substantially similar” to the original version submitted by mr sham and the modified design did not contain any “inventive concept” that was absent from the original sunbeam argues that the district court applied the wrong test when it ruled that the “improved design must contain an inventive concept” we disagree in hoop v hoop  fd   fed cir  we stated that “minor differences between the prior art and the new claim will not suffice” to make the person who suggested the changes that resulted in the differences an inventor we added that the differences   “must be substantial and not just superficial the new design must contain an inventive concept” id the district court therefore did not err by employing the “inventive concept” test furthermore the bankruptcy court found that the mr coffee employees’ contributions were not significant considering the overall appearance of the coffeemaker as well as the limited and mainly functional nature of the suggested changes in hoop we also articulated the ultimate test for design patent inventorship to be “whether the second asserted invention is ‘substantially similar’ to the first” id citations omitted in particular as a result of the changes to the design of an eagle shaped motorcycle fairing guard made by the party claiming inventorship the new fairing design had a noticeably different visual appearance see id at  figures  and  in that case we agreed with the trial court that the party claiming inventorship was likely not an inventor because the new fairing design had “strong similarities” to the drawings provided to that party by the inventor id at  in the present case the changes suggested by mr coffee are no more significant than those made by the party claiming inventorship in hoop accordingly we affirm the bankruptcy court’s ruling that mr coffee was not a joint inventor of the ’ patent lv although the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the mr coffee employees were not joint inventors it disagreed with the bankruptcy court’s finding that the ad design was not “jointly developed” by wing shing as that term was used in the agreement the district court therefore concluded that wing shing had breached its contractual obligation to negotiate patent rights prior to filing a patent application on the ad however both courts held that the statute of limitations period began to run   when wing shing breached the contract by filing the ’ patent application without first negotiating patent rights with sunbeam in july of  and that it expired in  at least two years before this case was filed thus both courts held that sunbeam could not prevail on its contractbased claim sunbeam now argues for the first time on appeal that equitable tolling should suspend the running of the statute of limitations its argument however runs afoul of the rule that arguments not made in the court whose order is under review are normally considered waived see eg caterpillar inc v sturman indus inc  fd   fed cir  sunbeam claims that it preserved the equitable tolling argument by raising the issue in its “reply posttrial memorandum of law” filed with the bankruptcy court the argument that sunbeam points to however was not based on equitable tolling but instead was based on new york state law principles of claim accrual sunbeam argued that under new york law a cause of action against a patentee does not accrue when the patent application is filed but only when ownership of the patent is in dispute therefore sunbeam contended “the earliest date upon which sunbeam’s cause of action accrued was  and the statute of limitations did not expire before sunbeam filed the instant suit” the bankruptcy court rejected sunbeam’s accrual argument on the ground that the breach of contract claim in this case was not tied to the dispute as to the patent’s ownership but was based on wing shing’s alleged failure to comply with its agreement to negotiate patent rights with mr coffee before filing a patent application that promise the court explained was breached if at all on july   when mr sham filed his patent application the   argument to which sunbeam directs us is not an equitable tolling argument and it therefore did not serve to preserve that issue for appeal in a portion of the same brief before the bankruptcy court sunbeam made a separate argument that wing shing’s “conduct and misrepresentations” caused sunbeam to fail to file its action in a timely fashion and that wing shing should therefore be estopped from relying on the statute of limitations as a defense to the breach of contract claim the bankruptcy court however noted that sunbeam conceded that it was aware or should have been aware of the ’ patent by march  at the latest and that sunbeam was therefore not prevented from filing a timely action for breach of contract accordingly the bankruptcy court rejected sunbeam’s “estoppel” argument sunbeam’s second argument is similar in some respects to the equitable tolling argument that sunbeam makes on appeal it differs however in that the estoppel doctrine invoked by sunbeam before the bankruptcy court requires the plaintiff to show that the action was brought within a reasonable time after the facts giving rise to the estoppel ceased to be operational see simcuski v saeli  ned   ny  the bankruptcy court held that sunbeam failed to meet that burden and sunbeam has not challenged that finding on appeal the estoppel doctrine that sunbeam raised at trial is sufficiently distinct from the argument that sunbeam now presses upon us that we cannot agree with sunbeam that the equitable tolling argument was fairly presented to the trial court we therefore decline to address the equitable tolling argument that sunbeam raises for the first time on appeal because we agree  we also decline to address sunbeam’s equitable recoupment claim which is made for the first time on appeal   with the bankruptcy court and the district court that the statute of limitations period had expired by the time sunbeam brought this action and because sunbeam does not argue that it could not reasonably have filed its breach of contract action between the time it learned of the alleged breach in  and the time the limitations period expired in  we do not reach the question whether sunbeam was a joint developer of the ad or if it was whether wing shing breached its obligation to negotiate patent rights prior to filing the ’ patent application v sunbeam argues that wing shing should be equitably estopped from claiming that sunbeam infringed the ’ patent and that the bankruptcy court misapplied the legal standards of equitable estoppel in this case in order for an equitable estoppel defense to bar a patent infringement claim the alleged infringer must show that  the patentee led the alleged infringer to reasonably infer that the patentee would not enforce its patent  the alleged infringer relied on that conduct and  the patentee suffered material injury as a consequence of that reliance ac aukerman co v rl chaides constr co  fd   fed cir  sunbeam complains that wing shing led it to believe that wing shing would not enforce its patent and that it relied on that representation to its prejudice sunbeam relies in particular on the march  telefax in which wing shing stated the following in response to mr coffee’s direction to transfer tooling for the ad to another manufacturer “it’s a sic bad news to us however you own this tooling and we will have no objection if you decide to do so we feel very disappointed on sic your suggestion our long term business relationship will then be hurt badly when it really   happens    however the important point is that we have the product design patent of ad and was being filed sic that means we can sell and we will sell the same product to other customers in the same market” sunbeam contends that the march  telefax lulled it into believing that wing shing had no objection to mr coffee transferring the production of the ad to another manufacturer and that it would not thereafter seek to enforce its design patent but at most would seek to promote the design among mr coffee’s competitors the bankruptcy court however concluded that mr coffee was not misled by that telefax into believing that wing shing would not sue for patent infringement the court alluded to evidence in the form of internal communications among sunbeam officers noting that wing shing owned the design patent for the ad that “it likely will be an issue if we part ways with them” and that the design of the ad might have to be changed “to avoid any patent issues tdb sic to be determined” based on that evidence the bankruptcy court concluded that “rather than being led to believe that wing shing was not going to pursue an infringement claim sunbeam was in fact concerned that the design patent might potentially become an issue of contention should sunbeam cease doing business with wing shing” and that sunbeam even considered reworking the ad design to avoid a possible infringement claim accordingly the bankruptcy court concluded “that sunbeam was not misled by wing shing’s conduct and that sunbeam was aware of and had discussed internally the potential danger of a patent infringement action being brought by wing shing at some future date” the district court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the bankruptcy court’s finding that “wing shing did not engage in conduct sufficiently   misleading for sunbeam to reasonably infer that wing shing would not enforce its patent rights” with respect to the internal mr coffee communications the district court noted that it was “clear from the opinion that the bankruptcy court found that wing shing’s conduct including the march  fax from wing shing to mr coffee was not misleading and more specifically that sunbeam did not rely on and was not misled by any such conduct” although the evidence on this point is subject to different possible interpretations we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court as factfinder did not commit clear error in finding that sunbeam was not misled into believing wing shing would never enforce its patent and that the march  telefax did not lead sunbeam to believe that wing shing would not look to enforce its patent at some point in the future because equitable estoppel does not apply if the alleged infringer fails to prove the existence of both misleading conduct and actual reliance on that conduct we uphold the district court’s ruling rejecting sunbeam’s equitable estoppel defense vl wing shing appeals from the bankruptcy court’s ruling that its failure to provide notice of infringement bars it from recovering damages for infringement prior to the date suit was filed the patent act provides that if a patentee does not mark the patented article the patentee cannot recover damages unless he shows that the infringer was actually “notified of the infringement and continued to infringe thereafter” see  usc § a see also sri int’l inc v advanced tech labs inc  fd   fed cir  the purpose of the notice requirement is to ensure that the accused infringer is aware of the patent during the period in which liability arises and damages accrue id wing shing neither marked its coffeemakers with the patent   number nor provided adequate notice to sunbeam that it was infringing the ’ patent wing shing argues that it gave sunbeam notice of infringement at a trade show in  when mr sham allegedly told a sunbeam employee that “we have the product design patent and sunbeam should not buy from anybody else but should buy from us” the bankruptcy court rejected mr sham’s uncorroborated testimony about that alleged communication on credibility grounds as the district court explained the bankruptcy court “was in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses and determine whether testimony was credible” like the district court we decline to upset the trial court’s credibility finding we also agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court “did not commit clear error in determining that wing shing failed to provide constructive or actual notice to sunbeam and therefore is precluded from the recovery of presuit claims” because we hold that the notice issue disposes of wing shing’s claim for pre suit damages we follow the same course as the district court and decline to address whether the bankruptcy court erred in holding that the doctrine of laches also bars wing shing from recovering presuit damages vll finally wing shing complains that the bankruptcy court erred in allowing sunbeam to deduct certain fixed costs allocated to the sales of the ad coffeemakers when calculating sunbeam’s profits on the infringing units the amount of damages is a finding of fact reviewed under the clearly erroneous rule minn mining  mfg co v johnson  johnson orthopaedics inc  fd   fed cir  however certain subsidiary decisions “such as choosing between reasonable alternative accounting methods for determining profit margin” are discretionary with the   trial court and are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard id smithkline diagnostics inc v helena labs corp  fd   n fed cir  in this case the bankruptcy court found that some fixed costs were properly attributable to the infringing coffeemakers and other fixed costs were not in addition the court refused to deduct those fixed costs that the court concluded sunbeam had failed to show were related to the production of the infringing products the court found that the fixed costs that were deductible were “directly related to the ad coffeemakers and that the ad coffeemakers could not have been brought to market without them” while wing shing argues that the evidence did not justify the court’s conclusion that those costs were related to the cost of selling the infringing units sunbeam introduced some documentary and testimonial evidence about the various categories of expenses and the bankruptcy court analyzed the categories in question with care although the evidence available to the court on this issue was somewhat limited we nonetheless agree with the district court that there was sufficient evidence for the bankruptcy court to make a reasonable determination of the costs associated with the sale of the ad units the court’s ruling on that issue was thus not clearly erroneous we also agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court made “reasonable determinations as to what categories and portions of items should be included and what costs should be deducted in calculating sunbeam’s profit” thus the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by employing a methodology that included certain cost items that wing shing argues should not have been deducted in calculating sunbeam’s profits on the infringing products

bc ibc  an international business company  is the most commonly used official name for what is more popularly known as an offshore company ibcs are the basic building blocks of the offshore financial services industry essentially a modern ibc is a private corporation which is exempt from tax suitable for virtually any international business activity has a flexible organizational structure is not burdened by excessive reporting and recordkeeping requirements and maintains strict confidentiality provisions since the adoption of the british virgin islands international business companies ordinance in  the bvi ibc has attained a model status in the offshore services industry with more than  total incorporations and more than  new companies registered every month bvi is by far the most popular offshore tax haven such is the dominance of the british virgin islands as an offshore corporate domicile that in many regions of the far east international business companies are called simply as bvis in january   a brandnew version of the bvi business companies act came into force the new act represents a further development in the already outstanding bvi offshore corporate legislation the new law successfully addresses the challenges faced by the offshore financial industry in the st century in particular the pressures against illegal discrimination between domestic and offshore companies thus the new bvi business companies act removes any former distinction between a local company operating in the domestic market and an offshore company restricted only to international business according to the new act there is now only one unified type of company  a bvi business company which continues to be exempt from tax and continues to enjoy all the substantial benefits afforded by the previous legislation the chief minister of the bvi dr the hon d orlando smith said at the announcement of the new legislation the new bvi business companies act was designed to safeguard the attributes that have made the bvi the worlds premier offshore company domicile the collaborative effort to draft this new act has resulted in legislation that not only retains all the virtues of the current ibc act but makes the bvi even more attractive to clients by including new features that have become desirable since the enactment of the current act a full text of the consolidated bvi business companies act is available in our downloads section cornerstones of success these are some of the general advantages of the british virgin islands over many other offshore financial centres us dollar is the official currency in the bvi  therefore by definition there can be no currency controls and no artificial manipulation of money supply by the local government bvi are a british overseas territory which provides for an outstanding political stability the country also maintains a low international profile and a clean reputation thus avoiding the pitfalls experienced by some more publicised and less scrupulous offshore tax havens bvi has an independent judicial system based on english common law laws and regulations are routinely developed in consultation with the private sector offshore financial services sector contributes a very significant part to the countrys gross domestic product therefore an inherent and pronounced interest exists both with the government and with the general public to maintain and develop the countrys status as a competitive offshore financial centre bvi is an independent country with a fairly high standard of living therefore it avoided entering any informationsharing agreements with foreign countries or organizations for exchange of financial aid client confidentiality is robustly enshrined in the bvi corporate and business legislation bvi is easily accessible by sea and air has modern telecommunications and is on us eastern standard time  hour behind est in winters the most important characteristics of a bvi bc in detail exemption from tax a bvi business company is exempt from the bvi income tax the same exemption applies to all dividends interest rents royalties compensations and other amounts paid by a company and all capital gains realised with respect to any shares debt obligations or other securities of the company no estate inheritance succession or gift tax is payable with respect to any shares debt obligations or other securities of a bvi bc all transactions and instruments relating to transfers of any type of property of assets shares debt obligations or securities to or by a bvi bc are exempt from the stamp duty with a sole exception for landownership transactions in the british virgin islands in which case stamp duty remains payable legal personality a british virgin islands business company has separate legal personality and the same powers as a natural person secrecy confidentiality is one of the key features of the bvi business company as details of the company beneficial owners directors and shareholders are not part of public record register of members register of directors and all minutes and resolutions by the company are kept only at the offices of the registered agent in complete confidentiality certainly though these files are available for inspection to company shareholders the only documents held on public record are the memorandum and articles of association but these normally do not contain any indication as to the actual shareholders directors or the beneficial owners of the company at the same time if the owners of the company so wish the register of directors andor the register of members may be filed with the registrar of companies such step may be desirable if a complete certainly must be achieved and showed publicly as to the actual identities of the company managers or members  but again this is purely optional structural flexibility a bvi business company requires a minimum of only one owner one shareholder and one director all of them can be one and the same person apart from the director the company need not appoint any operating officers the management structure of the bvi business company may be designed in accordance with the widest variety of requirements the shareholders directors and officers of a bvi business company may be individuals or corporations and of any nationality the shareholders or directors meetings need not be held in the british virgin islands and there is no requirement for an annual general meeting meetings can be held by telephone or other electronic means alternatively directors as well as shareholders may vote by proxy where a business company has only one member who is an individual and that member is also the sole director such sole member  director may specifically appoint a reserve director to act in his place in the event of his death provisions against confiscation if a foreign government or authority seizes company shares or any other interest in the company in connection with nationalization expropriation confiscatory tax other governmental charge or with a similar cause the company or a shareholder may apply to the bvi court for an order that the company disregard the seizure and continue to treat the person from whom the shares were seized as continuing to hold the shares no reporting bvi business companies does not have an obligation to prepare of file financial accounts however records must be kept that are sufficient to show and explain the companys transactions and will at any time enable the financial position of the company to be determined with reasonable accuracy such records do not have to be kept in the british virgin islands and the location for keeping such records can be freely determined by the owners of the company and there is no requirement whatsoever to file or otherwise make public any commercial or financial records of the company bearer shares shares of a bvi business company may be issued in bearer form however the bearer shares may not be issued to their actual owner but may only be kept in custody of a licensed custodian in the bvi or with such custodian outside bvi together with a written indication as to the actual identity and address of the owner of such shares the schedule of government fees for bvi business companies contains a clear negative incentive against utilising bearer shares in the structuring of the business companies as the government fees for such companies will be considerably higher various types of incorporations a bvi business company may be incorporated as a company limited by shares a company limited by guarantee with or without authorisation to issue shares an unlimited company with or without authorisation to issue shares a segregated portfolio company and a restricted purpose company no requirement to state operational objects since  there is no requirement to specify the operational objects of the bvi business

an existing bvi company that in the opinion of the registrar such name would be likely to confuse or mislead as the bvi registrar of companies has a namereservation system a reserved name would also be considered as an already existing name without obtaining a prior written consent of the financial servies commission a bvi business company may not be registered under a name that contains a restricted word or phrase according to a published list of such restrictions  such as the words assurance bank building society chamber of commerce chartered cooperative imperial municipal royal trust
