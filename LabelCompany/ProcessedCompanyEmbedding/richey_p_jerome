over  years he handled my divorce quickly my deed transfer solely into my name child support hearing pfa against my ex bf pfa my childrens father put against me between me and our children and most importantly eric was there for me to help our family get justice for my deceased son i was very touched how eric did so much for me and cared about my circumstances he did many extra things to help me that i cannot place a monetary value on when i needed an attorney i was very lucky to be introduced to eric jackson lurie esq by my friend who also had an excellent experience with eric winning his case for him in court i recently retained eric for a pfa that was put against me by my ex between me  my children who ive had custody of for  yrs  still do it was false allegations but eric took the time to explain to me the process of what could happen and i knew he could help me i felt like eric genuinely cared about me and he went above and beyond helping me he thoroughly explained his agreement of his duties and the details when i retained him before i signed the contract and paid he asked me if i had any questions about everything he spoke with me about and he made me feel welcomed to call him if i had any other questions that i thought of after i left his office i had heard how well he was in court but that did not prepare me enough for what an excellent job he actually did in court  when it was court day i felt confident in eric that he was going to do a good job and i was able to be at ease eric did talk to me prior to court day to explain the different possibilities of the outcomes and i valued his honesty i was amazed at how well he cross examined opposing counsel  we won in court with the allegations that were against me i knew if i didnt have eric i may not have had the same outcome eric met with me on a saturday even though it was the weekend before christmas eve to give me a copy of the order to dismiss so i could get my kids back in time to enjoy the holidays with them i would highly recommend eric jackson lurie esq to anyone in need of an attorney and have already recommended him to people eric helped me with many things and i value his knowledge in criminal lawlisa marie vari  assoc pctaraj ratedi retained jills services for a child custody matter and had consulted with her twice before that date i must say that i am extremely pleased with her services even though i am certain that she is very busy she has always made me feel like my case was a priority for her she has always taken the time to explain every step in the process and has shown an exemplary ability to formulate a plan and execute it when she tells me that she is going to do something i do not wonder if it will get done jill does what she says she will do when she says she will do it this type of reliability is hard to find these days jill takes copious notes and has a fantastic memory her attention to detail is second to none american wills  estatescindy c ratedi made an appointment to have a will drawn up for my personal and business assets i was quoted a price on the phone and he didnt try to add extra charges onto my bill  lloyd set an appointment with me and worked on the will he made many suggestions and corrections that helped me prepare my will he also prepared my power of attorney and my living will i was in and out of his office within  hours and i had my will in hand i am always skeptical about lawyers trying to talk me into something that i do not need to have lloyd was up front and honest i will continue to use his practicecindy cohenlisa marie vari  assoc pcanthony ratedwithin  minutes of meeting jill rosenthal i felt a sense of calm in very turbulent times for the record i have gone through  other family law firms and did not feel comfortable with them and jill made the decision easy you see my children are my life jill has been incredibly responsive genuinely caring very knowledgeable and i have grown to trust her experience and guidance she is one of the good people out there and i do not say that lightly she is excellent at what she does and as an italian me who needs to communicate she has been more than responsive to my needs flaherty fardo llcfrancisco c ratedi felt in very good hands from the start when i had to appeal my property tax reassessment by the school district the service i received was impecable from start to finish in terms of knowledge responsibility timeliness and communication the cost for their service was quite reasonable and in the end a reasonable agreement was reached with the school district i would certainly go back to them if i ever need legal help in the future i am convinced the best option is always to go with professionals of their caliber thank you to nicole hauptman and the entire teamflaherty fardo llcmicha p ratedafter my auto accident i did not feel the hassle of dealing with the legal system would be worth it i felt it would be too much work for too little results after meeting with attorney fardo he walked me through the steps attorney fardo simplified the process and his team owned the steps throughout the lawsuit his team kept me informed and showed me great compassion it took very little effort on my part the settlement was more than i had anticipated i would highly recommend flaherty  fardo they maximized outcome while simplifying the process eric jackson lurie esquirechobysiau rated eric jackson lurie has been my personal attorney for over  years i have nothing but good to say of him he was recommended to me for my case from a family friend who is also in law never regretted going through him he is very knowledgeable and is in good standing with the court and with law enforcement he won a very difficult case that i committed yrs ago and i thought i would live with it the rest of my life but after battling in the court with him as my representative we won definitely recommendable and would go through him

the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily
