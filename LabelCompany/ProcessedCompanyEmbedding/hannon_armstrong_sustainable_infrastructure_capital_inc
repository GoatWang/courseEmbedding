classes renewable energy energy efficiency other sustainable infrastructure sustainable investing leadership team investors sustainability investment analysis sustainability means different things to different people to help you understand our approach please read below background we believe that sound investing practices should include analysis of the environmental benefit of the proposed investment it is our practice to invest in projects that increase energy efficiency provide cleaner energy positively impact the environment or make more efficient use of natural resources as such we apply a clear and transparent set of policies when evaluating the environmental impact of any proposed investment what we mean by “sustainability” we define sustainability as positively impacting the environment while being neutral or reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions in addition to ghg emissions projects are screened for other environmental benefits such as water use reduction the quantification of environmental benefits is part of our investment screening process measuring the impact of hannon armstrong’s investment we analyze project specific data for example the expected reduction in annual energy consumption resulting from the installation of energy efficiency upgrades or the energy produced by a clean energy project to determine expected environmental benefit associated with such projects for example to measure the carbon impact we calculate the annual metric tons of carbon emissions offset by the project taking into consideration the fuel mix percentages and carbon intensities of fuel in the state where the project is located we then evaluate the relative impact of our potential investment by calculating the pounds of carbon emissions reduced annually per dollar invested disclosure standards for competitive reasons it is a general policy of hannon armstrong to not disclose specific investment information however we plan to release annually the co equivalent impact of each project we finance to provide appropriate transparency of the environmental profile of our portfolio in summary we believe that our investments have and will continue to have significant environmental benefits our promise to be on the right side of the climate change issue will continue to be a defining principle of the company and we are committed to disclosing the environmental impact of our financed projects to all interested parties  data source us environmental association’s egrid    hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure capital inc  site map facebook

previous page investment company act of  — sections ca and b hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure capital inc september   response of the office of chief counsel division of investment management your letter dated september   requests our assurance that the staff of the division of investment management the “staff” will not recommend that the us securities and exchange commission the “commission” or the “sec” take enforcement action against certain majorityowned subsidiaries each an “ha subsidiary” of hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure capital inc “hannon armstrong” under section  of the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” if each of the ha subsidiaries in reliance on sections ca andor b of the  act operates in the manner described in your letter and summarized below without registering with the commission as an investment company under the  act i  background you state the following  hannon armstrong is a publiclytraded company engaged in the business of providing debt and equity financing to participants in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector  the ha subsidiaries are primarily engaged in making loans and acquiring notes evidencing loans “notes” to project companies “projectcos” or managing members of projectcos “managing members” which are owned by renewable energy companies including solar energy and wind energy companies  a renewable energy company or an affiliated projectco directly enters into power purchase agreements “ppas” andor lease arrangements with residential commercial or utility customers an ha subsidiary makes loans to andor acquires notes from a projectco or the managing member of a projectco the notes held by an ha subsidiary are repaid solely through payments received on the ppas or leases by the projectco except in limited cases described below with payments dependent on customer energy usage as described below the purpose of either a lease or ppa is to provide for the purchase of energy and related services from the renewable energy company  renewable energy companies typically choose which type of agreement to use based on regulatory considerations andor customer preferences  in general from the perspective of a renewable energy company leases and ppas are economically equivalent and largely can be used interchangeably under a lease a solar energy company for example leases equipment such as solar panels to a customer who pays a fixed monthly amount in exchange for a guaranteed minimum amount of electrical energy over the term of the lease  solar power customers do not enter into the leases for the purpose of reselling energy or purchasing the solar panels  the purpose of a lease is to provide energy for the customer’s own use  leases do however frequently include a purchase option at the end of the lease term equal to fair market value of the leased equipment  under a ppa a renewable energy company builds or installs renewable energy infrastructure in order to provide energy to its customers  for example if the customer is an end user a solar energy company installs infrastructure such as solar panels on the customer’s home or commercial building  the solar energy company guarantees that a minimum amount of energy will be produced by the solar panels and is obligated to maintain and repair the solar panels and the customer pays for the energy produced by the panels on an ongoing basis  although the ppas provide for variable payments based on the amount of energy delivered by a project rather than fixed monthly payments they are otherwise economically indistinguishable from the leases  as under the leases the goal is to provide energy and related services in exchange for customer payments the ha subsidiaries are each engaged in making loans evidenced by notes to projectcos or their managing members andor purchasing such notes  in return for the purchase price of the notes a projectco or its managing member makes payments to the ha subsidiary from cash flows based on customer payments on specific leases andor ppas  this mechanism allows renewable energy companies and their projectcos or managing members to monetize future cash flows from leases andor ppas in order to fund their current activities the notes held by an ha subsidiary are repaid solely from payments that a projectco or renewable energy company as the case may be receives on a specified set of leases or ppas except in the cases of default  because returns on the notes depend on customer payments on the leases and ppas in deciding whether to acquire the notes an ha subsidiary considers factors such as the amount of energy anticipated to be delivered under a ppa or lease the age of the lease or ppa the status of construction and the quality of the applicable infrastructure or equipment the probability of default by a customer and other factors  these factors help the ha subsidiary determine the potential future cash flows that may be generated to support payments on the note you represent that each ha subsidiary currently holds at least  percent of the value of its total assets in the notes and other notes that you believe should qualify as section ca andor b qualifying assets and that at least  percent of the net income after taxes received by each ha subsidiary for the past four fiscal quarters combined was derived from the notes and other notes that qualify as section ca andor b qualifying assets  you represent that none of the ha subsidiaries has issued and none now issues or proposes to issue redeemable securities faceamount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates ii  analysis a         section ca and b as relevant here section c of the  act excludes from the definition of “investment company” any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities faceamount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses a purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes drafts acceptances open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise insurance and services b making loans to manufacturers wholesalers and retailers of and to prospective purchasers of specified merchandise insurance and services    you contend that each ha subsidiary meets the requirements of section c because it is primarily engaged in the noninvestment company business of a purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise andor services andor b making loans to manufacturers wholesalers and retailers of and to prospective purchasers of specified merchandise andor services  b         the “primarily engaged” requirement to rely on section c an issuer must be “primarily engaged” in one or more qualifying businesses  we have provided noaction assurance where among other things an issuer has established that a substantial majority of its assets are comprised of qualifying assets  you represent that each ha subsidiary currently holds at least  percent of the value of its total assets in the notes and other notes that qualify as assets under section ca andor b because as described below you believe that the energy and related services provided by a renewable energy company are “merchandise and services” for purposes of section ca and b c         section ca to rely on section ca an issuer must purchase or otherwise acquire among other instruments notes  you represent that the ha subsidiaries acquire the notes either by originating associated loans or purchasing the notes  in addition the exclusion from the definition of investment company provided by section ca is available only to those issuers that are primarily engaged in the business of acquiring qualifying obligations “representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise    and services    ”   in this regard we have stated that a note or other obligation must relate to the sale of specific merchandise insurance or services to be a qualifying obligation under section ca  you believe that because the ppas and leases provide for customers to pay amounts tied to the receipt of energy and related services and are otherwise primarily structured to facilitate the provision of energy and related services both the ppas and leases are best understood as contracts for the purchase and sale of energy and services and not leases of equipment  you further believe that because the notes held by an ha subsidiary entitle it to payments based on the payments for energy and related services under the ppas and leases the notes represent part or all of the sales price of merchandise and services for purposes of section ca  with respect to whether energy should qualify as “merchandise” and related services should qualify as “services” under section ca you note that we have previously considered forms of energy to be “merchandise or services” for purposes of section cb and you believe that it is reasonable to take the same position for purposes of section ca  in particular you state that under the leases and the ppas the related services involve generating transmitting and distributing energy and therefore should be treated as “services” for purposes of section ca  d      section cb to rely on section cb an issuer must “make loans to manufacturers wholesalers and retailers of and to prospective purchasers of specified merchandise    and services    ”  you represent that certain ha subsidiaries acquire the notes by making loans to projectcos andor their managing members and that each ha subsidiary that originates loans satisfies the requirement of section cb that it make loans  you also believe that because the ppas and leases are best understood as contracts for the purchase and sale of energy and services they should qualify as merchandise and services under section cb  you contend that projectcos and their managing members produce energy and use the ppas and leases to sell energy and related services to utility companies who sell the energy to end users and are therefore “manufacturers wholesalers and retailers” for purposes of section cb  you further argue that the loans relate to “specified merchandise and services” because payments flow to the ha subsidiaries from payments made to each projectco by customers for the purchase of energy and related services  iii  conclusion based on the facts and representations provided in your letter we would not recommend that the commission take enforcement action against an ha subsidiary under section  of the  act if such ha subsidiary in reliance on section ca andor b of the  act operates in the manner described in your letter without registering with the commission as an investment company under the  act  this response expresses our position on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusions on the issues presented  because this position is based on the facts and representations in your letter you should note that any different facts or circumstances may require a different conclusion       kyle r ahlgren senior counsel    renewable energy companies are companies that develop construct and maintain renewable power systems and infrastructure as a source of generating energy  renewable energy companies may provide energy and related services “related services” directly to end users such as residences and businesses or to power companies such as public utilities which deliver energy to their own end users  under the leases a renewable energy company is responsible for related services such as designing permitting constructing installing testing and activating the equipment covered by the lease connecting the equipment to and providing ongoing access to the electrical grid testing operations and training the customer on how to use the equipment and maintaining the equipment  under the ppas the related services involve designing and constructing the infrastructure performing all required studies such as environmental impact studies obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals certifications and verifications and coordinating with independent service operators or similar entities that operate the applicable energy grids associated with delivering the energy produced under the ppa  in most cases at the end of each year the solar energy company refunds the customer to compensate for energy production below the guarantee but the customer does not have to make an additional payment for any amounts exceeding the guarantee  the solar energy company credits the customer for any excess energy produced by the panels and uses those credits to cover any future shortfalls  thus although payments on the lease are flat each month the size of the aggregate payments made by the customer is ultimately variable and dependent on energy usage and energy production by the solar panels  certain ha subsidiaries also may acquire notes from wind energy companies that are repaid through the proceeds of ppas associated with wind energy generation projects  these ppas function in the same fashion as the solar ppas described above  you represent that the only instances in which payments on the notes are not made solely from customer payments involve cases of mandatory prepayments or default  you state that both types of provisions are common protections in renewable energy financing agreements and without such protections an ha subsidiary would have difficulty financing its transactions you further state that mandatory prepayments are primarily triggered by unforeseen and relatively uncommon events such as casualty insurance payments or condemnation recoveries and that in default an ha subsidiary is typically provided the right to exercise voting and other ownership rights over a broad range of assets of the applicable renewable energy company  finally you state that such assets may include the entity’s rights under various agreements insurance equity interests and other securities hard assets and others  you state that you are not requesting the staff’s views as to whether the notes held by the ha subsidiaries – other than the notes – are qualifying assets for purposes of section ca or section cb  see royalty pharma sec staff noaction letter aug   noaction position under section ca where  of the issuer’s assets were comprised of royalty interests obligating others to pay royalties representing part of the sales price of specific biopharmaceutical products  new england education loan marketing corp sec staff noaction letter may   “nellie mae” noaction position under section ca and b where the issuer’s primary and effectively sole business was originating or purchasing notes representing student loans econo lodges of america inc sec staff noaction letter dec   noaction position under section ca where at least  of the issuer’s assets consisted of notes representing franchise fees owed by franchisees for an integrated package of services provided by its parent company “econo lodges”  the staff has also provided noaction assurance under section c where among other things a substantial majority of an issuer’s income would be derived from qualifying receivables  see econo lodges  as noted above you represent that at least  percent of the net income after taxes received by each ha subsidiary for the past four fiscal quarters combined was derived from the notes and other notes that qualify as section ca andor b qualifying assets   nellie mae at   you note that the leases typically provide an option to purchase the equipment at fair market value upon termination  you note that the staff in bc ziegler and company sec staff noaction letter sept   suggested that leases with the option to purchase are qualifying assets for purposes of section ca only if a portion of each payment on the lease represents part of the purchase price of the leased equipment  you argue however that the obligations under the leases here represent all or part of the sales price of the energy and related services delivered pursuant to the leases  you cite to national rural utilities cooperative finance corporation sec staff noaction letter nov   providing noaction assurance under section cb to a cooperative making loans to member rural electric systems that delivered electricity to local distribution systems which in turn sold the electricity to consumers and coloradoute financial services corporation sec staff noaction letter may   providing noaction assurance under section cb to a company providing loans to an electricity cooperative and its member cooperatives where the loans funded the purchase of electric generating transmission and distribution facilities equipment and machinery  you note that these related services include designing and constructing the equipment andor infrastructure testing and activating the equipment performing all required studies such as environmental impact studies and training the customer on how to use the equipment as applicable depending on whether the related service is covered by the lease or the ppa  incoming letter the
