substantial discount until we generate operating cash flows sufficient to pay distributions to you we may pay distributions from financing activities which may include borrowings in anticipation of future cash flows or the net proceeds of this offering which may constitute a return of capital it is likely that we will be required to use return of capital to fund distributions if any in at least the first few years of operation we are not prohibited from undertaking such activities by our charter bylaws or investment policies and we may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions and it is likely that we will use offering proceeds to fund a majority of our initial distributions this is an initial public offering we have no operating history and the prior
