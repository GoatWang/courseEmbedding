hometechnology technology oec how it works organic rankine cycle technology orc technology leadership ormat offers unique renewable power solutions based on the ormat® energy converter oec a power generation unit which converts low medium and high temperature heat into electrical energy with  patents worldwide the oec is a stateoftheart implementation of organic rankine cycle technology that we have refined and perfected through more than  years of use under the most challenging conditions ormat’s flexible modular solutions for geothermal power and recovered energy generation are all based on the oec which is specifically designed for customized power plant options our proprietary technology enables geothermal developers to efficiently and economically use the full range of naturally occurring geothermal resources found throughout the world – from low temperature geothermal water to highpressure steam globally the oec is converting energy sources whether geothermal gas or heat into valuable electricity while setting industry standards for simplicity reliability and low operating costs ormat advantages designed for outdoor use as well as indoor installation and remote unattended operation the oec combines technological innovation with over  million operating turbine hours in the field flexibilityspecially designed and tailored plants match resource conditions and optimize the efficiency and cost effectiveness of electrical generation assures long turbine lifespanunlike its steam turbine counterpart and as a thermodynamic consequence of the hydrocarbons’ ‘drying fluid’ saturation curve the oec turbine remains dry under all expected working conditions this eliminates the possibility of erosion damage to the turbines buckets and nozzles thus the oec can accommodate part load operation and large transients more effectively than steam systems operation at low temperatures and anti freeze controlthe freezing point of the motive fluid is extremely low this feature eliminates the requirement to implement controls and procedures to prevent freezeup within the condenser heat exchangers and piping  remote unattended operationorctype power systems have compiled an exemplary reliability record wherever ormat has applied them these systems do not require  manning by a licensed steam plant operator these two features result in the ability to operate oec plants in a remote unattended mode by the same compression station operators  high turbine efficiency at low speedsdue to the motive fluid’s low sonic velocity the oec yields high turbine efficiency at  or  rpm  or  hz without a gearbox increasing plant output while reducing costs condensing near atmospheric pressurethe thermodynamic properties of the motive fluid provide much higher condensing pressures than comparable steam systems by operating at condensing pressures near atmospheric the turbine requires shorter blades and the ingress of air into the system is significantly minimized the latter feature mitigates the need for vacuum maintenance  high availabilityormat binary cycle plants have demonstrated the highest average plant availability in todays market  air and water coolingthe oec can operate with either air or water cooling depending on the availability and cost of suitable water resources air cooling systems feature low operating costs and an exceptionally low environmental profile they operate in a closed loop do not require chemical additives and involve no waste disposal in addition air cooled plants do not produce a visible plume and blend into the landscape  moisturefree turbine expansionthe oec turbine remains dry eliminating the possibility of erosion damage to the turbines buckets and nozzles therefore the oec can accommodate part load operation and large transients effectively  synchronous and asynchronous generatorsthe oec can be configured to produce either synchronous or asynchronous electricity according to local requirements high performance with minimal environmental impactormats modular power plants are designed to be environmentally friendly aircooled condenser technology enables us to reinject almost  of all extracted geothermal fluids thereby avoiding the use of geothermal steam condensate or external water resources for cooling and preventing the need for chemical additives the  reinjection also sustains reservoir life and productivity due to the low profile of the aircooled condensers and the lack of any plumes from water cooling towers both environmental and visual impacts are minimized

and classified as independent they are robert f clarke roger w gale david wagener dan falk sustainability the environmental benefits of geothermal and recovered energy geothermal energy is heat energy that comes from the earths molten interior deep in the earths crust this valuable heat is brought near to the surface due to movements in the earths crustal plates by intrusion of molten magma and by deep circulation of groundwater reservoirs of hot water under pressure are formed by drilling wells into these reservoirs steam and highpressure hot water can be captured and directed to drive turbines in power plants completing the conversion of this earthbound energy from heat to electrical energycooled geothermal fluid is injected back to the reservoir where it is reheated and preserves the resource mass balance and sustainability the advantages of geothermal energy are enormous it harnesses a natural locally available energy source it offers base load electricity  yearround supply with high reliability and provides an environmentally friendly energy alternative which produces no nox emissions and negligible co emissionsormat power projects eligible for greenhouse gas emissions trading in december  the executive board of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc officially registered ormat’s amatitlan geothermal project in guatemala as a clean development mechanism cdm the project is expected to offset emissions of approximately  tons of co per year with amatitlan registered under the cdm the project will be eligible to receive certified emission reduction credits each equivalent to one ton of carbon dioxide which can be traded or sold the project has a longterm contract to sell all of its emission reduction credits to a european buyer improving environmental performance ormats generating portfolio as of the end of  includes a total of  geothermal and recovered energy power plants in the united states guatemala kenya nicaragua
