which employ early redemption triggers the transaction has adequate credit enhancement totaling  for the class a notes  for the class m notes  for the class b notes and  for the class c notes rating sensitivities fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card assetbacked securities transactions  increased defaults  a reduction in purchase rate and  a combination stress of higher defaults and lower monthly payment rate mpr increasing defaults alone has little impact on rating migration except in the most severe scenario of a  increase in defaults which could result in downgrades the rating sensitivity to a reduction in purchase rate is less pronounced with no rating migration even in the severe scenario the harshest scenario assumes increased defaults and reduced mpr simultaneously all classes could be downgraded under the moderate stress of a  increase in defaults and  reduction in mpr to date the transactions have exhibited strong performance with all performance metrics within fitchs initial expectations for further discussion of our sensitivity analysis please see the related presale report

credit cardbacked notes announcement moodys amendments to wfn credit card master trust ii have no adverse effect on outstanding ratings global credit research   jun  new york june    moodys has reviewed amendments to the world financial network credit card master trust ii wfnccmt ii transaction documents dated june   specifically these amendments include the eighth amendment to second amended and restated pooling and servicing agreement the sixth amendment to purchase and sale agreement and the first amendment to transfer and servicing agreement for the wfn credit card master note trust ii these amendments permit world financial network national bank the bank to change the minimum payment and interest rate terms of their credit cards the amendments also eliminate the requirement to obtain ratings agency consent for prospective changes to these card terms at this time the abovereferenced amendments will not in and of themselves result in a reduction or withdrawal of the ratings currently assigned to any class of outstanding notes issued by the wfnccmt ii pending legislation by august   the credit card act will require credit card issuers to apply a reasonable and proportional test to penalty charges such as overlimit and late fees we expect revenues from fees will drop due to the proposed rules however these fees typically comprise a relatively small proportion of the total portfolio yield even so some issuers most notably private label card issuers like wfn will be affected more than others private label credit cards have a much lower balance on average than bank cards therefore the same late fee in dollar terms is a much higher proportion of the loan as a consequence any reduction in these fees will appear to have a disproportionately greater impact on the overall yield of private label portfolios we anticipate card issuers will adjust their card terms to recover or mitigate any lost revenue risks considered higher minimum payment terms and higher finance charges will place additional burdens on some cardholders and could precipitate an incremental rise in chargeoff rates however we believe that inaction would likely result in a more pronounced adverse impact on yield and consequently excess spread moodys ratings address only the credit risks associated with the transactions other noncredit risks have not been addressed but may have significant effect on yield andor other payments to investors the affirmation of moodys ratings should not be taken to imply that there will be no adverse consequence for investors since in
