rung of development careers tag archives anne finucane experiencesengaging the private sector in the post development agenda last week the brookings institution hosted a very informative panel discussion you can view it here on increasing the role of the private sector in the global development agenda the panel discussion entitled partnerships corporate social responsibility and the new development agenda centred around how to ensure that sustainability and accountability are at the heart of corporate strategy it also looked at how to engage business on sustainable development and how to mobilize companies to more effectively advance global priorities the panel consisted of anne finucane bank of america jane nelson harvard university daniella ballouaares us state department mindy lubber ceres and vera songwe world bank i shall begin by providing a short recap of the discussion and the main themes that emerged and then conclude with some of the my thoughts on the event partnerships and the new development agenda in response to growing recognition that the private sector has an important role to play in combating poverty promoting shared prosperity and enhancing environmental sustainability policymakers are working to define a clear role for the private sector in the post development agenda while this is a great start realizing such an ambitious agenda will require that the private sector become a global development leader in its own right there has never been a greater need for financial innovation and for banks financial institutions and investors to develop new products services technologies and even new business models so that they can be a part of the solution in driving more inclusive and sustainable growth some examples of private sectorled initiatives that contribute to development include new business models that reach lowerincome customers giving them access to basic products and services and bond issues for public health programs that accelerate research funding and the distribution of vaccines rebuilding public trust in the aftermath of the global financial crisis the private sector is facing a pretty serious public trust deficit if the private sector is going to play a leadership role in development they must work to rebuild this trust corporations need to demonstrate how they are improving their risk management systems government processes accountability and transparency while it is essential that these corporations address their governance and risk management issues it is equally important that they look to the future are not paralyzed by the past some necessary steps to rebuild trust include engaging in public dialogue with legislators regulators and consumers sharing knowledge and best practices and developing new products and services opportunities for financial innovation and new models of partnership many of the panellists echoed the sentiment that without significant engagement from the private sector we will not achieve a new set of development goals the private sector has the resources finance and expertise to face some of the most costly development challenges including climate change and expanding energy access without strong functional collaboration between governments ngos stakeholders and the private sector we cannot hope to mobilize even a fraction of the funds required to address these problems in addition the demand for business to provide financial resources and innovative solutions has become even more pronounced due to declining faith in the aidngo community to solve these problems with government resources becoming progressively constrained and the growing demand to demonstrate value for money spent the need for new models of partnership in development is becoming increasingly clear the ‘new models of partnership’ discussed by the panellists mostly involved banks companies and financial institutions coming up with innovative products and services and ngos helping to develop standards and evaluation tools one of the panellists stated that over time having sound development expertise will become a fundamental pillar of risk management strategy in order to protect their investment companies who operate in developing countries will make more of an effort to understand what and who they are investing in what gets measured gets managed in order to encourage greater participation from the private sector there needs to be a push for more tangible commitments where results can be seen having clearly laid out goals and targets is important because what gets measured gets managed currently one of the only things we have good measurements for are public aid flows and related activities panellist daniella ballouaares stressed that moving forward it will be critical to find ways to measure the value and impact of the private sector activities final remarks while i agreed with many of the points that the panellists made i found the discussion a little too hypothetical for my taste although the panellists expressed a sense of urgency to enhance the role of the private sector in development there wasn’t much of a discussion surrounding the logistics of how a partnership between development actors and the private sector could be achieved the discussion also focused more on how a partnership with the private sector could help the international community to achieve their development and sustainability goals without really a exploring how private sectorled development initiatives could help to improve or harm the lives of individuals and communities in developing countries the discussion left me with more questions than answers what kind of incentives will it take to encourage the private sector to step up to a leadership role in development is it even reasonable to expect that they will take on a leadership role what steps can the international development community to take to foster a partnership with the private sector in which sectors can business make the greatest difference to development outcomes what are some of the ethical implications of businessled approaches to development in my opinion the highlight of the event was the panellists themselves i was so pleased to see five dynamic female leaders on the panel and i really enjoyed how they emphasized the importance of women’s economic and social empowerment the panellists did an excellent job of affirming the necessity of engaging the private sector as a partner in development and what can be achieved if we are successful in doing so i believe that the private sector offers many lessons and best practices that could help to improve development impact and that the development community would have much to gain by working more closely with them i hope that the international community will move towards formulating a tangible realistic action plan to realize such a partnership   standard anne finucane world economic forum speaker

‘better’ company since the financial crisis by deon robertsderobertscharlotteobservercom linkedin google pinterest reddit print order reprint of this story march    am bank of america’s chief strategist says the charlottebased bank is a “better” more simplified company than it was before the financial crisis from its employment practices to its services “it is a better bank than it was six years ago i think that we had an opportunity to look at everything our employment practices our csr corporate social responsibility practices our products our services and in each of those instances i think we took a hard look simplified and made it better” anne finucane said in a video interview with bloomberg posted online last week finucane who holds the additional title of chief marketing officer at bank of america also said the banking industry is “much” more transparent than it was before the crisis just last week the federal reserve disclosed how the  largest usbased bank holding companies did on the regulator’s latest “stress tests” annual postcrisis exams designed to determine how lenders would fare in another major economic downturn finucane did not discuss the stress tests in the segment bloomberg posted online banking is still a “complicated business but there is a transparency to it and we have multiple regulators looking over what we’re doing” she said “my feeling is that it’s taken a long time the industry has improved it’s improved in its earnings it’s improved in its reputation it’s improved in its business with our customers and our clients and i think that it’s improved over time with the regulators too” finucane whose other responsibilities include overseeing bank of america’s communications operations and advertising strategy said the improving us economy is a positive for the banking industry whose image has taken a beating since the financial crisis “i do think when you have employment levels that have improved as much as they have and the economy is improving i do think that banks will not be seen as negatively” she said bank of america has often found itself the target of criticism as well as costly litigation since the crisis thanks in large part to its acquisitions of mortgage lender countrywide financial in  and investment bank merrill lynch in  as part of a 7 billion settlement in august with the department of justice bank of america admitted that it countrywide financial and merrill lynch took part in faulty mortgagebacked securities practices a lack of transparency into lenders’ exposures to risky mortgages packaged into such securities has been cited as a key contributor to the financial crisis banks also must be transparent finucane said on the other hand our clients expect us to make money for them and we need to do that too so we just have to be smarter about it” as for her comments about bank of america becoming a simpler company that effort has been ongoing under the tenure of ceo brian moynihan the push to make the bank simpler has been a departure from the empirebuilding that made the lender the coasttocoast behemoth it is today in a column last week john carney of the wall street journal points out that bank of america has slashed the number of subsidiaries to  from more than  also the bank’s loan book is now smaller than it has been since 7 before the acquisition of countrywide and merrill lynch carney wrote although moynihan has helped steer the bank through the financial crisis challenges remain he finds himself under continued pressure from investors to boost profits as litigation expenses continue to be a drag on the bank’s earnings moynihan was awarded  million for his performance in  a drop of  million from the year before as the bank posted a  percent drop in profit related
