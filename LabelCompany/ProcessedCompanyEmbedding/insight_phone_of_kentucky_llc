expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment

have alluded to dr figert also performed my inguinal hernia repair a few months ago i too found out after the fact that she had ordered a bladder catheter placed after i was anesthesized so i go online to research the entire procedure and also figerts backround what i found was enlightening and surprising laprascopic hernia repair is relatively new only gaining popularity since the mid 0s early on dr figert realized the many benefits of the new procedure over the old open style where mesh was simply placed on top of defect so dr figert honed her skills with special training and undertook the exceptionally long learning curve 00 plus surgeries to become an expert using the superior laprascopic tep approach totally extraperitoneal considered more difficult but better than the more invasive tapp method transabdominal dr figert also wisely chose the best polypropylene mesh and the highly regarded titanium helical devices for securing the mesh so where am i going with all of this with all of the very wise decisions made by dr figert my surgeon why would she cling to the outdated bladder catheterization protocol developed in the 0s when this laprascopic surgery was in its infancy the assumption then was that surgeons were slow and clumsy with these new fangled long instruments operated while viewing a monitor and during these early rather protracted laprascopic hernia repairs the bladder would become distended full with urine and become more vunerable to injury by the surgeon but that was  years ago and many thousands of hernia repairs ago now most experienced general surgeons perform the laprascopic procedure in  minutes to one hour and simply having the patient to empty their bladders completely during the hour or two in the preop area will suffice thus a patient with a nearly empty bladder undergoing a laprascopic hernia repair by an experienced surgeon has no medical reason to receive a bladder catheter this is where the paradox comes into play why would a surgeon like dr figert who was very progressive on techique tep and materials correct mesh and fixation still insist on ordering a relic from the past  foley indwelling baldder catheters  a foley catheter is a foot long and about mm in diameter  or about the size of a pencil and is forced into the urethra by the nurses hand using some lubricant they always carry urethra bacteria back into the bladder even while using sterile method and usually cause trauma to the urethra especially in males on some occasions the urethra tears or is punctured or the inflatable balloon causes permanent damage to the urinary tract those events could affect a persons ability to selfurinate forever so while dr figert is unquestionably a qualified surgeon for the reasons mentioned her absolute insistence on ordering painful and risky bladder catheters before any surgery may be enough of a reason to seek out a surgeon who does not expose patients to such archaic methods most general surgeons do not order bladder catheters for surgerys lasting under three hours so just check with other surgeons and youll find others who are confident and skilled and dont intentionally expose patients to unnecessary caths good luck to youfigert patricia mdluke s ratedone would like to believe that an experienced  plus years general surgeon would know the medical indications reasons to order bladder catheterization and they are acute urinary retention need for uncontaminated urine for tests patient immobility and urine blockage and finally bladder catheters are medically indicated before urinary tract  prostate surgery also any long duration surgery more than  hours to prevent bladder filling so it is very surprising that this surgeon dr patricia figert md would order bladder caths for her surgery patients not in any of those catagories and even for min to  hour routine surgeries for those who dont know a bladder catheter also known as an indwelling foley catheter is a large  mm or  diameter pencilsized   long plastic tube that a nurse forces into the patients urethra with her hand its implied that its a sterile procedure but actually the bacteria within the urethra naturally is carried back into the bladder contaminating it and sometimes causing urinary tract infections after the plastic tip of the tube is pushed in all of the way to the bladder the nurse uses a syringe of water to fill a balloon to secure the catheter tubing from slipping out on its own even after removal these catheters have nearly always caused trauma to the urethra from extreme stretching of the lining due to this urethra damage the ammonia in the urine causes days of urinary burning but first you may experience many hours of induced urinary retention another very common side effect of bladder catheterization occasionally severe urethra damage results from the catheterization and then surgery must then be performed for that repair hopefully by a more caring surgeondr figert attempts to justify cath orders by claiming that she might inadvertantly puncture a slightly distended bladder during surgery statistically an extremely low occurance and only intern novice and inexperienced general surgeons can claim that excuse for any routine surgery of less than  hours simply having the patient to empty their own bladder preop will suffice the surgeon could also use a bladder scanner ultrasound to confirm the bladders empty status before surgery but dr figert and some other oldschool surgeons just have old bad habits and willingly expose their patients to the many serious risks of bladder catheters it may be easier to find another surgeon who does not cath em all  good luck chris t may george conway juhl  stephenssurg m ratedive read with interest these patient reviews of the general surgeon dr patricia figert it seems that dr figert has a personal preference to order bladder catheters on virtually all of her patients years ago bladder catheters were considered a normal and routine preoperative practice much has changed but dr figert has not research and disturbing statistics now reveal that foley indwelling cathetization dr figerts choice is responsible for urethra damage bladder and kidney infections and worse they are supposedly inserted a sterile fashion but bacteria already residing in the urethra gets pushed back into the bladder initiating infections in many patients the catheter is a large tube nearly  diameter and is so long  to  that it curls up inside the bladder because the nurses are told to keep pushing it till it will go no fartherbut heres the thing patients who simply empty on their own need no catheter the only reason bladder catheters are ever needed before surgery is if the patient can not selfvoid beforehand or it the surgery will be extended several hours or more this should not be just the patients opinion against the surgeons opinion or personal prefernce this should be about the best and safest course of action for the patient here are the federal national institute of helath guidelines for laparoscopic hernia repair teptapp but the cautions given about limiting bladder catheterization apply to most surgeryssee chapters     see statements and recommendation boxes copy and paste into your browserwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmcsectitleand also more of the same from the very respected site emedicinehttpemedicinemedscapecomarticleperiprocedureawaabbbcongrats to you on researching your surgeon before just blindly choosing one you deserve a general surgeon who will provide you with the best care and not subject you the many risks of bladder catheteriztion simply because she or he has developed bad habits which exposes patients to those complications unnecessarilysm june jackson alan d mdbarbara a ratedmy doctor advised me to go to baptist health louisville ky emergency i was of the impressionthat my doctor would be attending me but he stopped seeing patients in hospital about a month earlier after seeing numerous doctors and lack of communication there was an error in my treatment plan that cost me dearly i was assigned a the hospital dr alan jackson this is the worst md i have ever encountered he tried to dismiss me when i was having pulmonary embolisms when i asked him if he was concerned about the pe he answered nosome one from cardio had to order an mri todetermine the pe and and extend my stay in hospital this doctor ha little experience and does not listen to the patient if you go to baptist health and is assigned this doctor runi asked to be assigned another doctor and was told no i am not by any means an indigent patienti asked to file a complaint with the hospital and was put off until i asked again the day of my dismissal a nurse was sent to take the complaint and didnt even bring paper and pen or accept the notes i written downshe seemed very unconcerned and disinterestedhoagland william p mdjim l ratedi am writing in response to all the critical reviews of dr figert and her preference to order bladder catheters for most all of her surgical patients you should know that she is of the generation of surgeons coming out of med school when laparoscopic procedures were very new 0s and at a time when catheters were thought to be harmless and were routine we now know better and as a female she couldnt possibly appreciate a male patients perspective and his aversion to the procedure much like male gynocologists falling out of favor by women who now nearly universally prefer a woman obgyn although she may not really have an excuse for her stubborness to skip the cath for patients able to fully void before surgery at least her history provides us with an explanation this can serve as a notice to male patients who are able to fully self void to seek out a male surgeon who is able to appreciate that aversion and act accordingly by not catheterizing before surgeries jimhalf price bookstheatrex ratedi have shopped at half price bi have shopped at half price books since they opened here a few years ago and yes there are goodies to be found theresometimes but beware what may seem like a bargain price is not if you pay attention to how much things are elsewhere i used to think this place was great until i realized that their prices on used stuff can be more than what one could get the same thing for new and their prices are pretty steep on things that are so scratched up they should be in a bargain bin i sold a dvd there recently that i got at walmart for 0 and when browsing the next time i was at the store i saw it on the shelf priced for about 0 more than walmart sold it new for i dont know if this pricing is out of sheer ignorance or if they just hope that people arent smart shoppers but since their selection seems pretty poor as of late im not giving them my business much anymoresarasohn charles mdsonjajade ratedthe staff at pns are all extremely nice and kid friendly ive never had a bad experience with any of the doctors or nurses and dr sarasohn in particular is just awesome hes down to earth and doesnt pump my son full of unnecessary medicines in fact hes quick to recommend a home remedy first which always works for my son before prescribing an antibiotic we work together to build my sons immune system through healthy diet and letting him tough out mild illnesses my only complaint is that one of the nurses has a really thick accent and its hard to understand him but he is super nice despite the language barrier and its obvious he cares about the children he sees i recommend this office to everyone particularly women who are giving birth at suburban hospital because the office is at the hospital and will be seen from birth by one of their professionalsspalding stuart mdcharolette w ratedi was looking for a doctor closer to my home and also within my network i was little worried about choosing another doctor so i stopped by the office to check it out first the office staff was really nice and helpful when i did meet the doctor i will have to say that dr stuart made my visit very comfortable the transition was great and i feel very through i felt like he covered my history very well and that i left there feeling like i would be in good hands the office was clean and liked having blood work done in the same area i did have to wait a bit but it only meant that he was taking time with others needs as well charolette wrosenberg a reyes mdcarabenn ratedbest doc arounddr reyes is the only doc i have met who will take the time to get to know you and familiarize himself with your specific issues you are not rushed his bedside manner is impeccable you will receive the most thorough work up i can not say enough good stuff the downside expect to wait to see him he gives everyone his time so when its your turn its worth it the staff is relaxed but kind this is not your average uppitymoney making office i believe he cares about his patients bottom line he is worth the wait time if you go block out at least  hours usually only takes  thoughkemper  kemper mdstksmisc rateddr warren r kemper is a realdr warren r kemper is a really great doctor to me he is what a physician should be he doesnt rush in and out he listens to you and spends an appropriate amount of time with you he remembers things about you like to ask about your family and kids which you dont much these days sometimes his staff gets a little irked with him running over with his patients and to me that is a good thing he has a good knowledge base and when i had whooping cough he suggested to the np that saw me that day to have me tested even though it was rare at the timeand i had it he is spot on and i appreciate his thoroughness did you knowphysicians and surgeons help to keep people

you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find

faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will
