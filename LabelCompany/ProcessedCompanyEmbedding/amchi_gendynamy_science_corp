it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability

categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be
