publications and news publications and news hedge fund and private equity fund secured loans and the volcker rule january  client alertsreports click here to download a pdf of the alert loans secured by interests in hedge funds and to a lesser extent private equity funds have been a staple of many banks’ credit offerings for years however the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act pub l  hr  “doddfrank” in general and the part thereof known as “the volcker rule” in particular have raised a basic question “can a banking institution subject to the volcker rule which is virtually every banking institution in the us continue to make and enforce hedge fund and private equity fund secured loans” on december   the various regulators with jurisdiction over the banking industry the “agencies” finally adopted the volcker rule which is the portion of doddfrank intended to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading in “covered funds”  in addition to the ban on proprietary trading the volcker rule severely restricts banks’ ownership in covered funds and certain transactions with affiliated covered funds covered fund interests as collateral lenders engaged in the typical hedge fund or private equity secured loan do not want to own the fund interest even in a default scenario their preferred “way out” of the loan upon a default is to redeem the fund interest through the fund’s redemption procedure or to sell the fund interest in the secondary market however it became apparent during the financial crisis of  when some funds suspended or delayed redemptions due to lack of liquidity and the secondary market all but dried up that the preferred course of action may not always be available therefore faced with the risk of funds being “gated” and the secondary market evaporating when needed some banks have increased reliance on the availability of remedies of a secured party including foreclosure as part of their credit underwriting for covered fund lending when doddfrank was enacted in  and the volcker rule was initially proposed the question of a bank’s ability to take a security interest in and to own covered fund interests even in connection with exercising remedies as a secured party became relevant since the stated purpose of the volcker rule is to eliminate proprietary trading by banks and ownership of covered funds and not to limit a bank’s lending products it stands to reason that the rule would not restrict a bank’s ability to obtain or foreclose on a security interest in a covered fund however while the draft rule contained an exemption to the overall prohibition for an ownership interest that is “acquired or retained by a bank in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith” it did not provide any additional guidance on the issue of taking a security interest or disposing of collateral fortunately the final rule expressly exempts from the definition of proprietary trading “any purchase or sale of one or more financial instruments by a banking entity in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in food faith” it also exempts banking entities’ acquisition or retention of ownership interests in covered funds in the “ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith” the preamble to the rule addresses this issue in more depth and states that the agencies believe that the purchase and sale of a financial instrument in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted does not constitute proprietary trading thereby providing an express exclusion for such purchases and sales of financial instruments the preamble goes on to say that the exclusion is necessary for banking entities to continue to lend to customers because it allows them to engage in lending activity with the knowledge that they will not be penalized for recouping losses should a customer default in the preamble the agencies expressly cite comments made by industry participants that address the acquisition and disposal of collateral for a debt as a prudent and desirable part of lending and debt collection activities the agencies acknowledge this and provide two examples of permissible activities in the preamble i banking entities including sec regulated brokerdealers will be able to continue to provide margin loans and may take possession of margined collateral following a customer default or failure to meet a margin call and ii cftcregulated banking entities will be able to take hold and exchange collateral on swaps super a restrictions the “super a” restrictions of the draft rule survive in the final volcker rule and prohibit a banking entity from entering into a “covered transaction” with a covered fund if the banking entity serves as investment manager or investment advisor or sponsors a covered fund among other activities however in the preamble to the final rule the agencies state that the rule permits margin and securities lending “to a customer secured by shares of a covered fund held in a margin account” the agencies state that an extension of credit by a banking entity to a thirdparty customer that is not a covered fund but that is secured by the shares of a covered fund affiliated with such banking entity is not subject to the super a restrictions because the transaction by the banking entity is not “with” the affiliated covered fund but rather “with” the unaffiliated thirdparty customer as explained in the preamble this would appear to permit a lender to secure a loan to a thirdparty customer with interests even in a sponsored covered fund enforcement of security interests as a secured lender with covered fund interests as collateral much like the lender in a margin or securitiesbased loan not involving covered fund interests a bank’s remedies will include a right to foreclose its security interest and take possession and dispose of its collateral therefore if a bank obtains a security interest in a covered fund as collateral in connection with its ordinary underwriting of a loan and takes title in connection with default thereunder and enforcement of a lien or in lieu thereof it appears that the rule expressly sanctions the resulting ownership and sale of the covered fund interest the rule does go on to require that a bank that acquires an ownership interest in a covered fund “divests the financial instrument as soon as practicable and in no event may the banking entity retain such instrument for longer than such period permitted by the agency” in our view this divestiture requirement is similar to the rules applicable to oreo other owned real estate for banks which provides that real property obtained in the foreclosure or other satisfaction of a debt has to be disposed of within five years each banking entity will need to look to the rules of its own regulator to determine the appropriate time period for divestiture conclusion while it is expected that various aspects of the volcker rule will be subject to legal challenge it appears that lending secured by covered fund interests including interests in affiliated covered funds and realization by banks on their security interest in such fund interests will be permitted under the current version of the rule for more information on the content of this alert please contact any member of our finance department    the institutions affected by these changes include most of the entities subject to the rules of the regulatory agencies currently involved in monitoring the financial system ie federal deposit insurance corporation us securities and exchange commission office of the comptroller of the currency federal reserve and commodities futures trading commission the final rule becomes effective april   and the conformance period has been extended an additional year until july    “covered funds” are essentially entities that would be investment companies under the investment company act of  but for an exemption thereunder ie private equity and hedge funds  in a typical loan secured by covered fund interests the lender will in most instances not take title to the fund interests at the time it makes the loan but will take a security interest in the fund interests to secure its loan  the preamble to the rule in the agencies’ own words “discusses many of the issues raised by the commenters and explains the agencies’ responses to those comments”  the agencies appear to be taking the approach that “margin loans” comprise not only typical margin loans made by brokerdealers but also securitiesbased loans made by banks or nonbank lenders other than brokerdealers as the final rule does not stipulate that only “brokerdealers” can make margin loans but rather indicates in the preamble that banking entities including secregistered brokerdealers will be able to continue to provide margin loans and take a position in the margined collateral following a customer’s default or failure to meet a margin call emphasis added accordingly in our view these specific references are examples of activities that will remain permissible and the rule does not limit its application to typical margin loans provided by brokerdealers   the “super a” restrictions essentially adopt the section a restrictions of the federal reserve act on transactions with affiliates but apply them to all entities in a banking entity’s chain rather than just banks as section a provides without certain standard exemptions contained in section a  again in our view because the final rule does not specify that a margin account be held at a brokerdealer the agencies’ intent would appear to be to permit margin loans and securitiesbased loans by any banking entity secured by interests in covered funds that are affiliates of such banking entity to be made subject to any requirements under section a as may be applicable  the preamble does warn that “the agencies expect banking entities not to structure transactions with third parties in an attempt to evade the restrictions on transactions with covered funds”  although the volcker rule also exempts ownership by a bank of covered funds as a custodian it would appear to limit a bank’s ability to take legal title to a covered fund interest as part of its original collateral package even if it takes title as custodian for itself as a secured lender because it can act only as a custodian for an “unaffiliated third party” and in certain limited circumstances for an affiliate also because the exemption uses the term “collecting a debt previously contracted” as opposed to “securing a debt” it would appear to permit ownership not as a security mechanism but only as an enforcement mechanism  note that the final rule has added that disposal of the covered fund interest is required “as soon as practicable” and in no event longer than the permitted regulatory holding period whereas the draft had required disposal only within the time period required by the applicable regulator  banking industry organizations have already instituted legal challenges to certain aspects of

new lawsuit over trademark transfer by tiffany kary tiffanykary more stories by tiffany kary june    am edt june    pm edt holdouts to loan amendment say unanimous consent is needed eaton vance and highland funds seek to block restructuring j crew group inc’s debt restructuring can’t go forward because not all lenders agreed to it and it seals the deal on an improper shift of trademark assets to benefit the retailers’ private equity owners two holdouts saidfunds affiliated with eaton vance corp and highland capital management sued jcrew and the agent to its  billion term loan in new york state supreme court thursday they say the agent wilmington savings fund society fsb needed unanimous consent of lenders for the deal it inked earlier this month consenting to the restructuring deal and waiving potential lawsuits against j crew over its controversial transfer of its trademark assets last yearon wednesday j crew said that  percent of lenders consented to the deal j crew and its affiliates “entities now in severe financial distress  intend to wrongfully impose their losses onto the backs of their secured lenders” the funds said alleging that wilmington let them do so in violation of the loan agreement that governs their debtfurthermore the funds say in the suit the restructuring was the last step of a scheme to transfer value away from secured lenders for the benefit of its ultimate shareholders tpg capital lp and leonard green  partners lp which bought j crew in  for  billionmargot fooshee spokeswoman for the j crew didn’t immediate return a message for comment tpg and leonard green didn’t immediately respond to calls seeking commentclawed backthe initial transfer of trademark assets to certain j crew affiliates was a socalled fraudulent transfer made with the intent of keeping the assets away from secured lenders and can therefore be clawed back the funds said the most important market news of the day get our markets daily newsletter sign up their suit describes how a layer of debt that was set to mature earlier than the secured debt   million in paymentinkind notes issued by the company in  and due in  before the term loan matured in   was created to fund a dividend to tpg and leonard green and how the transfer of trademark assets was used to give that collateral to the pik holders as part of an exchange offer actions taken by j crew around the trademark transfers are an event of default that should allow secured lenders to exercise their rights the funds said in their lawsuit instead wilmington and the majority of lenders capitulated to a deal that gives them less value than they’re entitled to the funds saidtrademark assetsthe restructuring deal essentially blessed the release of secured lenders’ rights to trademark assets dismissed a lawsuit against j crew and has them agree to pay a  million license fee for certain trademarks in exchange for cancellation of  million of their debt and the issuance of  million in new debtthe offer which gave lenders four days to decide whether to agree to it puts pressure on them because if they didn’t take part they would not benefit from j crew’s repurchase of  million of debt at par with interest at a time when they were trading at less than  cents on the dollar the funds saideaton vance funds hold around  million of the term loans and highland funds about  million according to the
