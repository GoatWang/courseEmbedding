aramark i just checked and still the order has not been pulled as of now very bad serviceif you dont have to buy from this company dontthey make it sound good but very poor servicei live  minutes from the warehouse and they tell me it would take  days to deliver my orderthey need to go out of business or do some house cleaning report is this review helpful cool    mespinosa   incompetence i am a dining room manager at a retirement community in dallas texas we signed on with aramark and our first delivery was friday june th we received half an order and no chefs coats for both properties however we did receive laundry bags with maggots we were told they would be back and bring the rest of the delivery but no show we were also promised we would have another delivery monday i waited almost the whole day but nothing i called a woman and placed an order for both properties and she passed it on nothing came i panicked because fourth of july was the next day and we had many reservations i had to go to our other property and thankfully they had in house linenthe next day th of july our district manager christian prater brought us  napkins and  for across the street when talking to him he commented we normally dont have new accounts at the end of the period he is trying to justify in why this happenedare you kidding me why would he even say that to a new customer i then went back and got more linen if i hadnt gotten the other linen i would have been in so much trouble i finally talk to christian prater dm and he delivered some linen on wednesday  by the way his version of an invoice was texting me the numbers by this time no chefs coats all of our cooks were using their own clothes to work in by friday we were promised yet again we would have it delivered between  and  i called christian   and he said he was working on it he said he didnt have the full order we are going round and round and i finally got off the phone i call at  still no order gave me the same run around and he said he would definitely deliver it in the meantime i talk to david null and he said he would check on it he is our sales person and has no idea what is going on by  or so he finally arrives this man pulls up in the front of our property and walks in the front door and brings our delivery is this his first time on the job this is not a regular business you have many residents with wheel chairs and walkers and he has his huge ugly white aramark truck in the way of the people who pay a substantial amount of money to live here and because of his truck they are having difficulty getting around him and his vehicle needless to say i got several calls asking me to have this truck removed i finally meet christian only to tell me my chefs coats are on back order and we will not receive them we have only been with them one week and they are already having issues with the order i ask him for an invoice and he doesnt have one and he said he is keeping track of it i asked him i want a copy of what he brought me and he asked me for a piece of paper and he preceded to write it on the paper are you kidding me the first order is half filled he texts me the next amount he delivered and then he writes it on the paper only because i insisted and you call this professional i can not believe this is how a huge company like aramark conducts business i called the   number and the customer service women were great and i asked to speak to the general manager  he was in a meeting but assured me he would respond i called three times and nothing i guess we are not a big enough company to warrant a call back needless to say i do not have a good first impression of this company or its management  report is this review helpful cool    kimthomp   inventory status is incorrect i purchased pants needed in a rush difficult size found them in stock at aramark paid for express shipping guaranteeing delivery within  days when i did not receive pants or a shipping confirmation i reviewed an email titled your order is in process on which it stated the shipping status is on order estimated warehouse delivery  weeks i lost precious time by their incorrect reporting of items being in stock when not  report is this review helpful cool    wsmcfarland   horrible customer service  do not use this company aramark is a very unprofessional and unhappy uniform company they have poor quality clothes and even worse customer service paul watson is a very angry man we entered into a contract with them it took them several months to get everyone sized correctly they charged us for jackets that we did not use they lose our clothes and then charge us for them saying that we lose them they only bring a portion of our clothes back which leaves us wearing our personal clothes it looks like they hang our shirts up wet and on wire hangers the result is a horn looking peak on the shoulders that does not go away they took forever getting names on some of our technicians shirts our employees complain constantly about the shirts being itchy and uncomfortable i was told by paul watson that if i tried to go with another uniform company that he would go the legal route and it would cost me over  they are not concerned with pleasing their customers paul watson tried to make me feel that we had done something wrong he is clearly used to talking down to customers and trying to intimidate them they only want to keep them in a contract for the money i would stay clear of aramark if negative stars were and option they would get them  report is this review helpful cool    jlw   terrible customer service placed an order on  for  pair of pants   shirts all in stock no extras just plain shirts as of  no shipping info called customer service automated phone system wasnt bad got a real person in less than  minutes after providing more information than would normally be needed to type in an order  and customer  ahh your order is still in process was anything on backorder  not according to your website when i placed the order  ahh it should ship soon it should have shipped last week do you have an estimated shipping date  ahh soon maybe tomorrow or next week really  report is this review helpful cool    boattrain   purchased a  coat for  on sale they marked it as backordered for almost  months now its canceled so i called to see if they could honor my price with a different color of the same coat all sizes and colors were originally on saleof course not why did they not tell me that when i could have swapped out to another color etc while it was still on salewill never deal with them again customer noservice did their thing by trying to sell me an almost coat instead with about  discount they said its close to what you originally ordered report is this review helpful cool    disapointed   i work in a factory in hollandohand we get our work uniforms from aramarkit is the worst company we have ever dealt withthe uniforms hems are out they dont fixi had hole in a shirt and tagged it for repair it came back with tag still on and no repair done so i tore it all the way down the side witch any body that could see would not miss i still received it back unrepairedi would not recomend this company for anythingreal bad customer service and no regard for customer satisfaction report is this review helpful cool    advancediesels   on our last order we purchased eight shirts and eight pairs of pants they charged me  in freight to my facility in anchorage alaska these items could been shipped in a large usps flat rate priority mail box and the freight would have been approximately  ive spoken to four different people at aramark none of whom can do anything about adjusting disputed freight charge im on the verge of terminating my business relationship with this company since customer service is nonexistent report is this review helpful cool    verybad   will never order from aramark again the last batch of work shirts came with small pockets and a lot of loose threads they are terrible cant even fix them aramark says they have several manufacturers making the clothes  probably all overseas aramark  go back to american made products report is this review helpful cool    drsaturn   if you are planning on ordering uniforms through aramark dont this is the most unethical company i have ever had the displeasure of dealing with they rope you in the door with a decent price and within six months will more than double the cost anyone you try to talk to about your problems with service could care less buyer beware dont fall in to the trap this company is a joke report is this review helpful cool    frustratedas   these guys have very poor customer service you call in an order and you never receive it because they lost it or never submitted it you receive an order but never an invoice ive had to request an invoice for each of my orders since  despite repeated calls to my account manager and sometimes it takes several calls just for one invoicei made a call about my coffee machine not working and  weeks later still nobody has showed up it even sprayed one of our employees with scalding water because the coffee packet got stuck and didnt eject into the catch bin are they just screaming for a lawsuiti dont know how they stay in business  their customer service
