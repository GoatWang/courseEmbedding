crusader the food you eat is making you sick and the agencies that are providing you with guidelines on what to eat are giving dangerous advice with devastating health consequences you can change that today about who had the audacity to write such an againstthegrain book exposing “healthy whole grains” for the incredibly destructive genetic monsters they’ve become that’s me dr william davis cardiologist and seekeroftruth in health over  of the people i meet today are prediabetic or diabetic in an effort to reduce blood sugar i asked patients to remove all wheat products from their diet based on the simple fact that with few exceptions foods made of wheat flour raise blood sugar higher than nearly all other foods yes that’s true for even whole grains more than table sugar more than a snickers bar organic multigrain sprouted–it makes no difference people returned several months later and did indeed show lower blood sugars often sufficient for prediabetics to be nonprediabetics but it was the other results that took me by surprise weight loss of  to  lbs over several months marked improvement or total relief from arthritis improvement in asthma sufficient to chuck  or  inhalers complete relief from acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome symptoms disappearance of leg swelling and numbness increased mental clarity deeper sleep and more stable moods and emotions i witnessed incredible experiences like the year old man incapacitated by fullbody joint pains who started to jog again painfree and the year old schoolteacher who just weeks before her surgeon scheduled colon removal and ileostomy bag experienced a cure from ulcerative colitis and intestinal hemorrhage and stopped all medications that’s when i asked why this would happen why would removing the darling of all dietary advice — “healthy whole grains” — result in substantial weight loss and often astounding turnarounds in numerous health conditions as i spoke to agricultural geneticists and studied the evidence it became clear that modern wheat had undergone extensive changes changes introduced primarily for purposes of increased yield per acre converting the traditional  foot tall “amber waves of grain” into a highyield inch tall stocky semidwarf strain the changes were not just in outward appearance but were accompanied by changes in numerous other components—none had been tested for suitability for human consumption products made from modern wheat contain forms of gliadin proteins glutenins wheat germ agglutinin and other proteins never before encountered by humans as i explored the implications of these changes i asked people to remove all foods made with modern semidwarf wheat with its unique components health was not just improved it was transformed — and wheat belly was

williams was arrested for the murder the following day coroner’s inquest testimony on august   followed by the arraignment on august   revealed a total of five shots had been fired at the deputies from a single location one of the deputies present at the shooting identified williams as the person who fired the rifle at deputy pate williams was held to answer for first degree murder with the possibility of a death sentence attorneys representing williams then notified the court williams could not be tried for the charges against him due to insanity williams and five black workers he hired to run the still were charged with operating the still on october   a man jury was impaneled to hear the testimony and decide the issue of williams sanity testimony started on october  and continued for four days williams was again identified by the deputy sheriff as the person who shot at deputy pate all five workers employed by williams testified that as the deputies approached they ran in a different direction than williams and the gunshots came from the direction in which williams had run the hearing ended in a hung jury  for sanity on november   his attorneys withdrew the insanity plea and williams entered a plea of guilty to murder in the nd degree immediately afterwards williams and his five workers pleaded guilty to the charge of making liquor on november   williams received a

in cumberland county superior court on the charge of secret assault on deputy pate williams testified during the trial that he had fired the first couple of shots but didn’t intend to kill the deputy williams gave the rifle to dawson who fired the remaining shots with the intent to kill the deputy the same day the all white  man jury voted  for acquittal and dawson was released prison yearsedit early carbines created while in prison while serving time at the caledonia state prison farm in halifax county north carolina williams related that the superintendent ht peoples noted his mechanical aptitude and allowed him access to the prison’s machine shop where he demonstrated a knack for fashioning his own tools the shop lacked he began servicing the weapons used by the guards at the prison his skills in the machine shop permitted him to stay ahead of his assignments and allowed him time to develop his ideas for selfloading firearms he would save paper and pencils and stay up late at night drawing plans for various firearms his mother sent him a drafting set technical data on guns and eventually provided him with patent attorneys contacts who were unable to help him as long as he was incarcerated williams designed and built four semiautomatic rifles while in prison all four used the high pressure gas within the breech as a cartridge was fired to operate their semiautomatic actions the means used to accomplish this was a floating chamber containing the cartridge that channeled the gas at the front of the chamber to force the floating chamber backwards into the bolt with sufficient energy to operate the action rearward movement of the chamber was limited to a short stroke to impact the bolt face in effect making the floating chamber a short stroke gas piston all four rifles are part of the permanent david marshall williams display in the north carolina museum of history commutation and paroleedit his family started a campaign to commute his sentence and they were joined by the sheriff to whom he had surrendered the widow of the man he was convicted of killing was approached and agreed his sentence should be commuted if his work would help the country the request for commutation was submitted to north carolina governor angus mclean on november   on december   north carolina governor angus mclean commuted the sentence from thirty years to “a minimum of ten and maximum of twenty years” records of the office of superintendent nc state prisons indicate williams was regularly discharged from the states prison by expiration of sentence on september   firearms developmentedit back in cumberland county he set to work perfecting his inventions filing his first patents on february   amongst these was a patent application entitled “automatic firearm” us patent  published aug   this application detailed his concept for the use of the high pressure gas in or near the breech to operate the action of a semiautomatic firearm the application and subsequent patent detail several different designs to accomplish this including the floating chambers he manufactured on the four rifles built while imprisoned colt manufacturing companyedit in  colt manufacturing company introduced the colt ace pistol a  long rifle caliber rimfire version of colts ma  acp pistol for training purposes this pistol was specific to the  rimfire cartridge with a recoil equivalent to its cartridge in  williams was contracted by colt to redesign the colt ace with his floating chamber the end result was the colt service ace “firearm” us patent  published aug   a  caliber rimfire pistol with a recoil stronger than that of the colt ace but less than that of its ma  acp counterpart in  colt introduced the colt    service model conversion unit ace also designed by williams the conversion unit could be used to convert the a  acp pistol to  long rifle caliber rimfire for training the kit allowed for pistol to be converted back to its original a  acp the kit was also used to convert the earlier colt ace pistols for use as a colt service ace with the floating chamber us ordnance departmentedit after two years he went to washington dc to show his work to the war department he received his first contract to modify the  caliber browning machine gun using the floating chamber system to fire  caliber rimfire ammunition to facilitate inexpensive training his conversions were permanent two patents were filed for this design on mar   and published feb   “automatic weapon patent” us patent  and belt feeding means for guns us patent  the original williams design was redesigned and improved upon by others into a  caliber conversion unit that allowed the ma to be converted back and forth between  caliber and  caliber rimfire “automatic firearm” us patent  published feb   this conversion kit was designated the “trainer machine gun caliber  m” for the a subsequent versions were created for the a caliber  m and anm caliber  m  remington armsedit about  remington arms contracted williams to produce a  long rifle caliber rimfire semiautomatic rifle utilizing his floating chamber intended for the commercial market the rifle designed and developed by williams can be seen in two patents “firearm” us patent  and “firearm” us patent  the williams design was not accepted by remington the rifle was redesigned by remington employees k lowe and cc loomis using the williams floating chamber the rifle was designated the remington model  and introduced in  the patents for the rifle “firearm” us patent  published jul   and “firearm” us patent  published aug   credited the earlier williams patent us patent  of the williams floating chamber for use with a  long rifle caliber rimfire rifle this rifle was the first semiautomatic rimfire rifle capable of operating with either the  short  long or  long rifle cartridges winchester repeating arms and world war iiedit management at winchester repeating arms company was already aware of the work of williams when in  one of their patents us patent  was contested by williams as it infringed on one of his earlier patents for a sear us patent  winchester agreed with williams and negotiated a settlement the ordnance department’s general julian hatcher was impressed by williams work and recommended williams to winchester repeating arms in  as showing the greatest native ability of anyone he knew winchester entered into negotiations with williams who was hired fulltime by winchester on july   williams was assigned the task of taking over the design of a semiautomatic rifle invented by jonathan edmund browning half brother of john browning and matt browning the design had been purchased by winchester who had also hired jonathan browning to improve the design browning’s career at winchester was cut short by his untimely death during a medical operation several weeks prior to williams being hired winchester had hoped the browning design might replace the m rifle invented by john garand one of the problems that had been encountered with the browning design was the gas system that operated the rifle’s semiautomatic action by may  williams had fitted the rifle with a short stroke gas piston outside the bore of the barrel that used the gas forward of the breech to cause the piston to strike the operating slide and cycle the action winchester designated this rifle the winchester model gm the rifle developed with this version of the short stroke gas piston was used during us ordnance department trials at quantico va and aberdeen md from march through april  followed by trials with the marines in san diego during the fall and winter of  based on the experience gained during these trials winchester directed williams to redesign the rifle to correct additional problems chamber it for the standard military rifle cartridge  m  and make it as light as possible williams completed the changes by may  with the result weighing only   pounds winchester designated this rifle the winchester model gr by may  the us ordnance dept had started trials of a number of submissions for a light rifle design that would eventually be chambered for the  caliber carbine cartridge winchester initially decided against developing a submission due to other commitments that included the browning prototype being worked on by williams during the trials of the winchester model gm at quantico and san diego it had become apparent to winchester they were not going to be able to replace the m by garand when williams produced the   pound winchester model gr it convinced winchester they should be able to come up with a prototype for the light rifle trials the challenge for winchester was producing a working light rifle in time for preliminary tests pending a second set of light rifle trials williams had already shown he worked at his own pace so winchester assigned two other employees to head up the project when williams was not included he was livid williams refused to have anything to do with the gun and did not want his name associated with it thirteen days after they had begun the employees at winchester completed the first prototype the receiver rotating bolt slide and short stroke gas piston used on this first prototype were designed based on those used by williams to produce the   pound winchester model gr of these four parts three were designed by williams from parts already in use on other rifles the one part williams could take credit for was the short stroke gas piston that accessed the high pressure gas near the breech to operate the semiautomatic action the preliminary tests of the first prototype by the ordnance department on august   proved the design had sufficient merits for winchester to proceed with the development and submit a light rifle by the september   deadline for the final trials for the nd prototype winchester formed a second team consisting of the two prior employees and others with williams as the project director three days later winchester removed williams from the team after assessment of a dispute between williams and the others that had forced the project to a halt the team continued the work on the nd prototype without williams who winchester allowed to design his own prototype concurrent to the others on september   the nd prototype light rifle designed by the team was complete and ready for submission but for two problems that had yet to be resolved williams was asked to help the others sort out the problems and collectively solutions were found that allowed the prototype to be transported and submitted to the ordnance department by the deadline the ordnance trials were completed and the winchester light rifle was adopted as the carbine caliber  m carbine on september   williams had been unable to complete his own light rifle prototype in time for the trials the prototype by williams was a downsized version of his winchester model gr design photographs of this carbine are retained by the springfield armory museum and the cody firearms museum buffalo bill historical center williams had previously entered into a license agreement with winchester on september   for use of his patented short stroke gas piston us patent  in exchange for a royalty payable to williams on the basis of the value of each gun manufactured containing the invention throughout the end of  and into  western cartridge co winchester negotiated with the ordnance department for the design of the m carbine in february  ordnance proposed a one time lump sum royalty payment of  in exchange for a royalty free production license on  mar  williams voluntarily entered into another agreement with winchester accepting  percent of this lump sum   equivalent to  in   over and above his salary in lieu of royalty payments winchester signed the agreement with ordnance on  mar   the contract for the us carbine cited  patents as part of its design four of these were held by williams as an assignor of western cartridge company winchester two were related to the winchester model g as designed by williams “takedown firearm” us patent  published dec   and “gas operated selfloading firearm” us patent  published apr   the third was winchester’s patent for the us  caliber carbine m “automatic firearm construction” us patent  published jan   with williams as the assignee the fourth was the carbine’s short stroke gas piston “piston means for gasoperated firearms” us patent  published feb   winchester felt the earlier williams patent for his floating chamber gas piston “automatic firearm” us patent  was sufficiently different from the design used in the us  caliber carbine m that they would have won an inevitable court battle with williams but saw no point in it as winchester retained the patent rights with williams as their assignee and the time taken by a court battle would be counterproductive to the overall goal of manufacturing the carbine for timely use by american forces already at war williams continued working at winchester on the winchester model g a light machinegun version known as the winchester automatic rifle war intended to replace the m browning automatic rifle bar and a  caliber antitank rifle version as the design of several of these firearms neared completion the war’s end in august  and subsequent budget cutbacks ended these projects williams assisted winchester throughout the war on a number of smaller projects including the design and development of the rear flip sight for the us caliber  carbines winchester repeating arms – post world war iiedit along with his  m browning military rifle jonathan edmund browning had developed patented and sold to winchester a design for a semiautomatic shotgun us patent  us patent  us patent  after the war winchester assigned williams to the project of developing the shotgun for sporting use as an assignee of olin industries winchester williams obtained two patents related to his design “inertia operated bolt lock” us patent  published jul   and “firearm with movable chamber and sealing sleeve” us patent  published august   winchester introduced the shotgun in  as their model  automatic shotgun in  and  gauge the shotgun featured an inertia operated bolt lock designed by williams the bolt block and cartridge sat within a large floating chamber when the gun was fired the gas forward of the floating chamber forced the chamber to the rear approximately th of an inch in a short stroke that generated the energy necessary for the bolt block to disengage the rear of the floating chamber and operate the semiautomatic action this was the first semiautomatic shotgun with a fixed nonrecoiling barrel in  winchester introduced their model  automatic shotgun which also utilized the williams design from the model  this model featured the winlite glass barrel it was a thin tube wrapped with microfilament glass fibre this model could bullied with the first ever screwin versalite choke tubes movie fameedit in  mgm released the film carbine williams starring james stewart as williams with jean hagen as his wife maggie the movie details williams life from

original story of the army carbine the rifle that was born in prison as authored by williams and told by ridenour was published prior to the creation of the movie script by the charlotte observer on february   the article includes an introduction by ridenour declaring the article to be a correct accounting of events within the article williams is quoted in  i went to work for winchester and it was while working for them that i invented the us army carbine that is in use today b fay ridenour was a newspaper reporter for the charlotte observer returning to godwin nc after his travels with the movie williams was thereafter known as carbine williams and personally adopted the moniker during newspaper magazine and radio interviews stimulated by the movie williams repeated his story as presented in army carbine the rifle that was born in prison the fictional legend created by the publication of this story has continued to be the source for authors to this day final yearsedit williams ca  the november   edition of the fayetteville observer included an article entitled condition of williams is still critical” “david marshall carbine williams  of godwin rte  inventor of the army carbine was in critical condition saturday at midnight in a dunn hospital williams physician dr lr doffermyre said his examination late saturday night indicated that williams was extremely

williams is buried in the cemetery of the old bluff presbyterian church near wade north carolina legacyedit while the fictional legend of “carbine williams” has garnered williams more attention over the years his design redesign and development of firearms that used the high pressure gas in or near the breech to operate their semiautomatic action has remained a significant contribution used in

arms and world war iiedit management at winchester repeating arms company was already aware of the work of williams when in  one of their patents us patent  was contested by williams as it infringed on one of his earlier patents for a sear us patent  winchester agreed with williams and negotiated a settlement the ordnance department’s general julian hatcher was impressed by williams work and recommended williams to winchester repeating arms in  as showing the greatest native ability of anyone he knew winchester entered into negotiations with williams who was hired fulltime by winchester on july   williams was assigned the task of taking over the design of a semiautomatic rifle invented by jonathan edmund browning half brother of john browning and matt browning the design had been purchased by winchester who had also hired jonathan browning to improve the design browning’s career at winchester was cut short by his untimely death during a medical operation several weeks prior to williams being hired winchester had hoped the browning design might replace the m rifle invented by john garand one of the problems that had been encountered with the browning design was the gas system that operated the rifle’s semiautomatic action by may  williams had fitted the rifle with a short stroke gas piston outside the bore of the barrel that used the gas forward of the breech to cause the piston to strike the operating slide and cycle the action winchester designated this rifle the winchester model gm the rifle developed with this version of the short stroke gas piston was used during us ordnance department trials at quantico va and aberdeen md from march through april  followed by trials with the marines in san diego during the fall and winter of  based on the experience gained during these trials winchester directed williams to redesign the rifle to correct additional problems chamber it for the standard military rifle cartridge  m  and make it as light as possible williams completed the changes by may  with the result weighing only   pounds winchester designated this rifle the winchester model gr by may  the us ordnance dept had started trials of a number of submissions for a light rifle design that would eventually be chambered for the  caliber carbine cartridge winchester initially decided against developing a submission due to other commitments that included the browning prototype being worked on by williams during the trials of the winchester model gm at quantico and san diego it had become apparent to winchester they were not going to be able to replace the m by garand when williams produced the   pound winchester model gr it convinced winchester they should be able to come up with a prototype for the light rifle trials the challenge for winchester was producing a working light rifle in time for preliminary tests pending a second set of light rifle trials williams had already shown he worked at his own pace so winchester assigned two other employees to head up the project when williams was not included he was livid williams refused to have anything to do with the gun and did not want his name associated with it thirteen days after they had begun the employees at winchester completed the first prototype the receiver rotating bolt slide and short stroke gas piston used on this first prototype were designed based on those used by williams to produce the   pound winchester model gr of these four parts three were designed by williams from parts already in use on other rifles the one part williams could take credit for was the short stroke gas piston that accessed the high pressure gas near the breech to operate the semiautomatic action the preliminary tests of the first prototype by the ordnance department on august   proved the design had sufficient merits for winchester to proceed with the development and submit a light rifle by the september   deadline for the final trials for the nd prototype winchester formed a second team consisting of the two prior employees and others with williams as the project director three days later winchester removed williams from the team after assessment of a dispute between williams and the others that had forced the project to a halt the team continued the work on the nd prototype without williams who winchester allowed to design his own prototype concurrent to the others on september   the nd prototype light rifle designed by the team was complete and ready for submission but for two problems that had yet to be resolved williams was asked to help the others sort out the problems and collectively solutions were found that allowed the prototype to be transported and submitted to the ordnance department by the deadline the ordnance trials were completed and the winchester light rifle was adopted as the carbine caliber  m carbine on september   williams had been unable to complete his own light rifle prototype in time for the trials the prototype by williams was a downsized version of his winchester model gr design photographs of this carbine are retained by the springfield armory museum and the cody firearms museum buffalo bill historical center williams had previously entered into a license agreement with winchester on september   for use of his patented short stroke gas piston us patent  in exchange for a royalty payable to williams on the basis of the value of each gun manufactured containing the invention throughout the end of  and into  western cartridge co winchester negotiated with the ordnance department for the design of the m carbine in february  ordnance proposed a one time lump sum royalty payment of  in exchange for a royalty free production license on  mar  williams voluntarily entered into another agreement with winchester accepting  percent of this lump sum   equivalent to  in   over and above his salary in lieu of royalty payments winchester signed the agreement with ordnance on  mar   the contract for the us carbine cited  patents as part of its design four of these were held by williams as an assignor of western cartridge company winchester two were related to the winchester model g as designed by williams “takedown firearm” us patent  published dec   and “gas operated selfloading firearm” us patent  published apr   the third was winchester’s patent for the us  caliber carbine m “automatic firearm construction” us patent  published jan   with williams as the assignee the fourth was the carbine’s short stroke gas piston “piston means for gasoperated firearms” us patent  published feb   winchester felt the earlier williams patent for his floating chamber gas piston “automatic firearm” us patent  was sufficiently different from the design used in the us  caliber carbine m that they would have won an inevitable court battle with williams but saw no point in it as winchester retained the patent rights with williams as their assignee and the time taken by a court battle would be counterproductive to the overall goal of manufacturing the carbine for timely use by american forces already at war williams continued working at winchester on the winchester model g a light machinegun version known as the winchester automatic rifle war intended to replace the m browning automatic rifle bar and a  caliber antitank rifle version as the design of several of these firearms neared completion the war’s end in august  and subsequent budget cutbacks ended these projects williams assisted winchester throughout the war on a number of smaller projects including the design and development of the rear flip sight for the us caliber  carbines winchester repeating arms – post world war iiedit along with his  m browning military rifle jonathan edmund browning had developed patented and sold to winchester a design for a semiautomatic shotgun us patent  us patent  us patent  after the war winchester assigned williams to the project of developing the shotgun for sporting use as an assignee of olin industries winchester williams obtained two patents related to his design “inertia operated bolt lock” us patent  published jul   and “firearm with movable chamber and sealing sleeve” us patent  published august   winchester introduced the shotgun in  as their model  automatic shotgun in  and  gauge the shotgun featured an inertia operated bolt lock designed by williams the bolt block and cartridge sat within a large floating chamber when the gun was fired the gas forward of the floating chamber forced the chamber to the rear approximately th of an inch in a short stroke that generated the energy necessary for the bolt block to disengage the rear of the floating chamber and operate the semiautomatic action this was the first semiautomatic shotgun with a fixed nonrecoiling barrel in  winchester introduced their model  automatic shotgun which also utilized the williams design from the model  this model featured the winlite glass barrel it was a thin tube wrapped with microfilament glass fibre this model could bullied with the first ever screwin versalite choke tubes movie fameedit in  mgm released the film carbine

related that the superintendent ht peoples noted his mechanical aptitude and allowed him access to the prison’s machine shop where he demonstrated a knack for fashioning his own tools the shop lacked he began servicing the weapons used by the guards at the prison his skills in the machine shop permitted him to stay ahead of his assignments and allowed him time to develop his ideas for selfloading firearms he would save paper and pencils and stay up late at night drawing plans for various firearms his mother sent him a drafting set technical data on guns and eventually provided him with patent attorneys contacts who were unable to help him as long as he was incarcerated williams designed and built four semiautomatic rifles while in prison all four used the high pressure gas within the breech as a cartridge was fired to operate their semiautomatic actions the means used to accomplish this was a floating chamber containing the cartridge that channeled the gas at the front of the chamber to force the floating chamber backwards into the bolt with sufficient energy to operate the action rearward movement of the chamber was limited to a short stroke to impact the bolt face in effect making the floating chamber a short stroke gas piston all four rifles are part of the permanent david marshall williams display in the north carolina museum of history commutation and paroleedit his family started a campaign to commute his sentence and they were joined by the sheriff to whom he had surrendered the widow of the man he was convicted of killing was approached and agreed his sentence should be commuted if his work would help the country the request for commutation was submitted to north carolina governor angus mclean on november   on december   north carolina

discharged from the states prison by expiration of sentence on september   firearms developmentedit back in cumberland county he set to work perfecting his inventions filing his first patents on february   amongst these was a patent application entitled “automatic firearm” us patent  published aug   this application detailed his concept for the use of the high pressure gas in or near the breech to operate the action of a semiautomatic firearm the application and subsequent patent detail several different designs to accomplish this including the floating chambers he manufactured on the four rifles built while imprisoned colt manufacturing companyedit in  colt manufacturing company introduced the colt ace pistol a  long rifle caliber rimfire version of colts ma  acp pistol for training purposes this pistol was specific to the  rimfire cartridge with a recoil equivalent to its cartridge in  williams was contracted by colt to redesign the colt ace with his floating chamber the end result was the colt service ace “firearm” us patent  published aug   a  caliber rimfire pistol with a recoil stronger than that of the colt ace but less than that of its ma  acp counterpart in  colt introduced the colt    service model conversion unit ace also designed by williams the conversion unit could be used to convert the a  acp pistol to  long rifle caliber rimfire for training the kit allowed for pistol to be converted back to its original a  acp the kit was also used to convert the earlier colt ace pistols for use as a colt service ace with the floating chamber us ordnance departmentedit after two years he went to washington dc to show his work to the war department he received his first contract to modify the  caliber browning machine gun using the floating chamber system to fire  caliber rimfire ammunition to facilitate inexpensive training his conversions were permanent two patents were filed for this design on mar   and published feb   “automatic weapon patent” us patent  and belt feeding means for guns us patent  the original williams design was redesigned and improved upon by others into a  caliber conversion unit that allowed the ma to be converted back and forth between  caliber and  caliber rimfire “automatic firearm” us patent  published feb   this conversion kit was designated the “trainer machine gun caliber  m” for the a subsequent versions were created for the a caliber  m and anm caliber  m  remington armsedit about  remington arms contracted williams to produce a  long rifle caliber rimfire semiautomatic rifle utilizing his floating chamber intended for the commercial market the rifle designed and developed by williams can be seen in two patents “firearm” us patent  and “firearm” us patent  the williams design was not accepted by remington the rifle was redesigned by remington employees k lowe and cc loomis using the williams floating chamber the rifle was designated the remington model  and introduced in  the patents for the rifle “firearm” us patent  published jul   and “firearm” us patent  published aug   credited the earlier williams patent us patent  of the williams floating chamber

arms and world war iiedit management at winchester repeating arms company was already aware of the work of williams when in  one of their patents us patent  was contested by williams as it infringed on one of his earlier patents for a sear us patent  winchester agreed with williams and negotiated a settlement the ordnance department’s general julian hatcher was impressed by williams work and recommended williams to winchester repeating arms in  as showing the greatest native ability of anyone he knew winchester entered into negotiations with williams who was hired fulltime by winchester on july   williams was assigned the task of taking over the design of a semiautomatic rifle invented by jonathan edmund browning half brother of john browning and matt browning the design had been purchased by winchester who had also hired jonathan browning to improve the design browning’s career at winchester was cut short by his untimely death during a medical operation several weeks prior to williams being hired winchester had hoped the browning design might replace the m rifle invented by john garand one of the problems that had been encountered with the browning design was the gas

created while in prison while serving time at the caledonia state prison farm in halifax county north carolina williams related that the superintendent ht peoples noted his mechanical aptitude and allowed him access to the prison’s machine shop where he demonstrated a knack for fashioning his own tools the shop lacked he began servicing the weapons used by the guards at the prison his skills in the machine shop permitted him to stay ahead of his assignments and allowed him time to develop his ideas for selfloading firearms he would save paper and pencils and stay up late at night drawing plans for various firearms his mother sent him a drafting set technical data on guns and eventually provided him with patent attorneys contacts who were unable to help him as long as he was incarcerated williams designed and built four semiautomatic rifles while in prison all four used the high pressure gas within the breech as a cartridge was fired to operate their semiautomatic actions the means used to accomplish this was a floating chamber containing the cartridge that channeled the gas at the front of the chamber to force the floating chamber backwards into the bolt with sufficient energy to operate the action rearward movement of the chamber was limited to a short stroke to impact the bolt face in effect making the floating chamber a short stroke gas piston all four rifles are part of the permanent david marshall williams display in the north carolina museum of history commutation and paroleedit his family started a campaign to commute his sentence and they were joined by the sheriff to whom he had surrendered the widow of the man he was convicted of killing was approached and agreed his sentence should be commuted if his work would help the country the request for commutation was submitted to north carolina governor angus mclean on november   on december   north carolina governor angus mclean commuted the sentence from thirty years to “a minimum of ten and maximum of twenty years” records of the office of superintendent nc state prisons indicate williams was regularly discharged from the states prison by expiration of sentence on september   firearms developmentedit back in cumberland county he set to work perfecting his inventions filing his first patents on february   amongst these was a patent application entitled “automatic firearm” us patent  published aug   this application detailed his concept for the use of the high pressure gas in or near the breech to operate the action of a semiautomatic firearm the application and subsequent patent detail several different designs to accomplish this including the floating chambers he manufactured on the four rifles built while imprisoned colt manufacturing companyedit in  colt manufacturing company introduced the colt ace pistol a  long rifle caliber rimfire version of colts ma  acp pistol for training purposes this pistol was specific to the  rimfire cartridge with a recoil equivalent to its cartridge in  williams was contracted by colt to redesign the colt ace with his floating chamber the end result was the colt service ace “firearm” us patent  published aug   a  caliber rimfire pistol with a recoil stronger than that of the colt ace but less than that of its ma  acp counterpart in  colt introduced the colt    service model conversion unit ace also designed by williams the conversion unit could be used to convert the a  acp pistol to  long rifle caliber rimfire for training the kit allowed for pistol to be converted back to its original a  acp the kit was also used to convert the earlier colt ace pistols for use as a colt service ace with the floating chamber us ordnance departmentedit after two years he went to washington dc to show his work to the war department he received his first contract to modify the  caliber browning machine gun using the floating chamber system to fire  caliber rimfire ammunition to facilitate inexpensive training his conversions were permanent two patents were filed for this design on mar   and published feb   “automatic weapon patent” us patent  and belt feeding means for guns us patent  the original williams design was redesigned and improved upon by others into a  caliber conversion unit that allowed the ma to be converted back and forth between  caliber and  caliber rimfire “automatic firearm” us patent  published feb   this conversion kit was designated the “trainer machine gun caliber  m” for the a subsequent versions were created for the a caliber  m and anm caliber  m  remington armsedit about  remington arms contracted williams to produce a  long rifle caliber rimfire semiautomatic rifle utilizing his floating chamber intended for the commercial market the rifle designed and developed by williams can be seen in two patents “firearm” us patent  and “firearm” us patent  the williams design was not accepted by remington the rifle was redesigned by remington employees k lowe and cc loomis using the williams floating chamber the rifle was designated the remington model  and introduced in  the patents for the rifle “firearm” us patent  published jul   and “firearm” us patent  published aug   credited the earlier williams patent us patent  of the williams floating chamber for use with a  long rifle caliber rimfire rifle this rifle was the first semiautomatic rimfire rifle capable of operating with either the  short  long or  long rifle cartridges winchester repeating arms and world war iiedit management at winchester repeating arms company was already aware of the work of williams when in  one of their patents us patent  was contested by williams as it infringed on one of his earlier patents for a sear us patent  winchester agreed with williams and negotiated a settlement the ordnance department’s general julian hatcher was impressed by williams work and recommended williams to winchester repeating arms in  as showing the greatest native ability of anyone he knew winchester entered into negotiations with williams who was hired fulltime by winchester on july   williams was assigned the task of taking over the design of a semiautomatic rifle invented by jonathan edmund browning half brother of john browning and matt browning the design had been purchased by winchester who had also hired jonathan browning to improve the design browning’s career at winchester was cut short by his untimely death during a medical operation several weeks prior to williams being hired winchester had hoped the browning design might replace the m rifle invented by john garand one of the problems that had been encountered with the browning design was the gas system that operated the rifle’s semiautomatic action by may  williams had fitted the rifle with a short stroke gas piston outside the bore of the barrel that used the gas forward of the breech to cause the piston to strike the operating slide and cycle the action winchester designated this rifle the winchester model gm the rifle developed with this version of the short stroke gas piston was used during us ordnance department trials at quantico va and aberdeen md from march through april  followed by trials with the marines in san diego during the fall and winter of  based on the experience gained during these trials winchester directed williams to redesign the rifle to correct additional problems chamber it for the standard military rifle cartridge  m  and make it as light as possible williams completed the changes by may  with the result weighing only   pounds winchester designated this rifle the winchester model gr by may  the us ordnance dept had started trials of a number of submissions for a light rifle design that would eventually be chambered for the  caliber carbine cartridge winchester initially decided against developing a submission due to other commitments that included the browning prototype being worked on by williams during the trials of the winchester model gm at quantico and san diego it had become apparent to winchester they were not going to be able to replace the m by garand when williams produced the   pound winchester model gr it convinced winchester they should be able to come up with a prototype for the light rifle trials the challenge for winchester was producing a working light rifle in time for preliminary tests pending a second set of light rifle trials williams had already shown he worked at his own pace so winchester assigned two other employees to head up the project when williams was not included he was livid williams refused to have anything to do with the gun and did not want his name associated with it thirteen days after they had begun the employees at winchester completed the first prototype the receiver rotating bolt slide and short stroke gas piston used on this first prototype were designed based on those used by williams to produce the   pound winchester model gr of these four parts three were designed by williams from parts already in use on other rifles the one part williams could take credit for was the short stroke gas piston that accessed the high pressure gas near the breech to operate the semiautomatic action the preliminary tests of the first prototype by the ordnance department on august   proved the design had sufficient merits for winchester to proceed with the development and submit a light rifle by the september   deadline for the final trials for the nd prototype winchester formed a second team consisting of the two prior employees and others with williams as the project director three days later winchester removed williams from the team after assessment of a dispute between williams and the others that had forced the project to a halt the team continued the work on the nd prototype without williams who winchester allowed to design his own prototype concurrent to the others on september   the nd prototype light rifle designed by the team was complete and ready for submission but for two problems that had yet to be resolved williams was asked to help the others sort out the problems and collectively solutions were found that allowed the prototype to be transported and submitted to the ordnance department by the deadline the ordnance trials were completed and the winchester light rifle was adopted as the carbine caliber  m carbine on september   williams had been unable to complete his own light rifle prototype in time for the trials the prototype by williams was a downsized version of his winchester model gr design photographs of this carbine are retained by the springfield armory museum and the cody firearms museum buffalo bill historical center williams had previously entered into a license agreement with winchester on september   for use of his patented short stroke gas piston us patent  in exchange for a royalty payable to williams on the basis of the value of each gun manufactured containing the invention throughout the end of  and into  western cartridge co winchester negotiated with the ordnance department for the design of the m carbine in february  ordnance proposed a one time lump sum royalty payment of  in exchange for a royalty free production license on  mar  williams voluntarily entered into another agreement with winchester accepting  percent of this lump sum   equivalent to  in   over and above his salary in lieu of royalty payments winchester signed the agreement with ordnance on  mar   the contract for the us carbine cited  patents as part of its design four of these were held by williams as an assignor of western cartridge company winchester two were related to the winchester model g as designed by williams “takedown firearm” us patent  published dec   and “gas operated selfloading firearm” us patent  published apr   the third was winchester’s patent for the us  caliber carbine m “automatic firearm construction” us patent  published jan   with williams as the assignee the fourth was the carbine’s short stroke gas piston “piston means for gasoperated firearms” us patent  published feb   winchester felt the earlier williams patent for his floating chamber gas piston “automatic firearm” us patent  was sufficiently different from the design used in the us  caliber carbine m that they would have won an inevitable court battle with williams but saw no point in it as winchester retained the patent rights with williams as their assignee and the time taken by a court battle would be counterproductive to the overall goal of manufacturing the carbine for timely use by american forces already at war williams continued working at winchester on the winchester model g a light machinegun version known as the winchester automatic rifle war intended to replace the m browning automatic rifle bar and a  caliber antitank rifle version as the design of several of these firearms neared completion the war’s end in august  and subsequent budget cutbacks ended these projects williams assisted winchester throughout the war on a number of smaller projects including the design and development of the rear flip sight for the us caliber  carbines winchester repeating arms – post world war iiedit along with his  m browning military rifle jonathan edmund browning had developed patented and sold to winchester a design for a semiautomatic shotgun us patent  us patent  us patent  after the war winchester assigned williams to the project of developing the shotgun for sporting use as an assignee of olin industries winchester williams obtained two patents related to his design “inertia operated bolt lock” us patent  published jul   and “firearm with movable chamber and sealing sleeve” us patent  published august   winchester introduced the shotgun in  as their model  automatic shotgun in  and  gauge the shotgun featured an inertia operated bolt lock designed by williams the bolt block and cartridge sat within a large floating chamber when the gun was fired the gas forward of the floating chamber forced the chamber to the rear approximately th of an inch in a short stroke that generated the energy necessary for the bolt block to disengage the rear of the floating chamber and operate the semiautomatic action this was the first semiautomatic shotgun with a fixed nonrecoiling barrel in  winchester introduced their model  automatic shotgun which also utilized the williams design from the model  this model featured the winlite glass barrel it was a thin tube wrapped with microfilament glass fibre this model could bullied with the first ever screwin versalite choke tubes movie fameedit in  mgm released the film carbine williams starring james stewart as williams with jean hagen as his wife maggie the movie details williams life from

february   the article includes an introduction by ridenour declaring the article to be a correct accounting of events within the article williams is quoted in  i went to work for winchester and it was while working for them that i invented the us army carbine that is in use today b fay ridenour was a newspaper reporter for the charlotte observer returning to godwin nc after his travels with the movie williams was thereafter known as carbine williams and personally adopted the moniker during newspaper magazine and radio interviews stimulated by the movie williams repeated his story as presented in army carbine the rifle that was born in prison the fictional legend created by the publication of this story has continued to be the source for authors to this day final yearsedit

studies that offer useful information sunday september   can you trust dr david williams my patients often share with me the myriad health newsletters to which they subscribe recently a patient gave me a newsletter written by dr david williams my first question before reading the newsletter was what kind of doctor is dr williams the patient responded im sure hes an md in fact dr williams is a chiropractor  now dont get me wrong i have nothing against chiropractors as ive used them myself for strained backs and shoulders also i have no problem with anyone writing about nutrition as long as they stick to scientifically validated facts however i do have two major pet peeves people who distort information and people who try to confuse you with information so they can sell you something the newsletter i was asked to read concerned the lost value of eating an entire chicken and all parts of animals not at one sitting because otherwise you dont get the gelatin contained in bone marrow etc the premise was as is often the premise in such rubbish is that the more recent trends not to eat the chitins pig intestine pancreas etc has led to diabetes heart disease obesity etc and if you eat them all those problems may disappear the newsletter starts innocently enough like they all do with a pseudoscientific explanation of the importance of gelatin to our health but like most of these noncredible newsletters it veers off to the fantastic when it makes unsubstantiated health claims of course the moment that starts i become suspicious if theres a sales pitch coming up to dr williams credit there was no pitch for selling his own gelatin but there was reference to another commercial product which i could not find for sale on his website nevertheless dr williamss website lists many products for sale of questionable value including the now highly disputed resveratrol due to research improprieties the bottom line on dr williams is that he has an actual degree and a license he is more trustworthy than those phds from nonaccredited schools that ive been writing about in previous blogs notwithstanding when dr williams makes preposterous claims about the all curative health benefits of a substance like gelatin he throws his credibility into seriously questionable territory and by doing so undermines any good he may otherwise be capable of doing facts and science matter and we have enough bad information already out there we dont need more articles that tell us this may help us and this may hurt us  it only adds to the confusion i feel if you dont have something of value to say stay quiet as the old saying goes better to keep your mouth closed and be thought a fool than open it and remove all doubt posted by steven charlap at  am email thisblogthisshare to

no training in nutrition the only people who should even be commenting on dr williams are registered dietitians doctors knocking down the benefits of food when they dont even have training in diet or

significant natural products part i marine antitumor macrolides peloruside a a plan for the convergent enantiocontrolled synthesis of peloruside a will be executed peloruside a induces apoptosis in the gm phase of the cell cyclic with microtubulestabilizing activity the macrolide is more than  x less susceptible than paclitaxel to multidrug resistance due to the overexpression of the pglycoprotein efflux pump additionally peloruside a is more readily administered and appears to bind to a different site on tubulin compared to paclitaxel peloruside a studies offer significant chemical advancements which will supply natural product and important derivatives for probing biological investigations part ii zoanthamines investigations of this novel class of marine alkaloids describe challenging issues of chemical synthesis toward densely functionalized polycyclic systems members of this class have exhibited important antitumor and antiinflammatory activities and norzoanthamine is considered to be a promising osteoporetic candidate recently zoanthenol has demonstrated specific inhibition of collageninduced platelet aggregation part iii a australifungin australifungin is a potent antifungal which is the first nonspingosinebased inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis it functions as a selective inhibitor of sphinganine nacyl transferase and may have an important role in lipid signal transduction cell differentiation and apoptosis part iii b daphnicyclidin a this recent discovery has revealed a new molecular architecture which exhibits significant antitumor activity our research will investigate strategies for chemical synthesis of these complex polycyclic systems      funding agency agencynational institute of health nih institutenational
