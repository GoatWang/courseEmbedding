thank you marisa good morning and thank you for joining us the fourth quarter and the year were both successful when i first spoke to you in  i laid out our priorities and we subsequently executed against them the balanced growth i emphasized was achieved and we delivered strong product used promotions with restraint and managed inventories carefully to grow our topline and comparable sales and to improve our margins together these actions enabled us to significantly boost our profitability and set the stage for further gains in  for the fourth quarter our sales increased by  our comparable sales increased by  our operating income grew  which in turn lifted our operating margin by  basis points to  our diluted eps grew  to  it was gratifying to turn in a performance that once again exceeded our guidance and marks our fourth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear growth for the year as a whole our sales increased by  our comparable sales increased by  our operating income grew  which lifted our operating margin by  basis points to  and our adjusted diluted eps grew  to  our strong cash flow enabled us to continue investing in our business while also enhancing our capital structure for the benefit of our shareholders to this end during  we used  million to redeem our outstanding debt and repurchase  million worth of our common stock given these positive results id like to address what we have achieved and how we have incorporated these processes into our operating principles we achieved many successes last year and i believe express is set up to continue winning let me explain why in  we made some fundamental changes to the way in which we operate our business first our product composition was modified to incorporate more fashion items and to flow in newness more often product categories were expanded and new collections were introduced we now cover a broader spectrum of our customers wardrobe needs and intend to continue down this path second we introduced new disciplines around product testing inventory management and speedtomarket collectively these are bringing better product to our customers faster reducing fashion risk and ensuring a tighter control of inventory and opentobuy dollars third we adopted a degree approach to marketing and focused on many new branding activities to drive engagement with our customers we are also partnering with key influencers which is elevating the image of express while much was accomplished last year we have significant opportunity to further build awareness and familiarity as it relates to the express brand and we will seize these opportunities fourth we continue to upgrade our systems and processes significant omnichannel opportunities lie ahead once we transition to new foundational systems fifth we introduced new financial disciplines that created a more balanced financial architecture we focused on topline growth product margin expansion and expense discipline to ensure that every dollar spent has a clear purpose and that every project undertaken will deliver an appropriate return on the investment we believe this ongoing focus on our financial architecture will drive consistent profitable growth for years to come sixth and lastly we focused on strengthening our balance sheet by repaying our debt we also returned excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program our pristine balance sheet provides us with financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and to continue enhancing shareholder returns those items represent just a few of the many changes put in place express as it is functioning today is quite different than the express organization of the past for example we believe that our fashion and our brand are more relevant and appealing to our customers we are more efficient and adaptable we are more financially disciplined and we are more technologically capable the shopping habits and priorities of millennials have been written about in countless articles theyre technologically astute fashionsavvy and want to wear things that make them feel confident each new collection is comprised of carefullycurated items which exemplify the best of the new season we have a strong value proposition and are proud of our high quality and fair prices and while todays customers may shop differently than in the past they still like to shop in stores and online we believe one of our competitive advantages is that we offer customers a chance to shop across channels in fact many onlineonly brands are opening stores to give customers a chance to experience their product and the human touch firsthand change is a constant in our industry and our focus is on providing our customers with the best possible store and ecommerce experiences when our terrific product is supported by new systems we will use omnichannel tools to bring increased flexibility to the shopping experience and new capability to customize shoppers interactions with express our management team is fully committed to the concept of continuous improvement to ensure we remain highly relevant and successful at this time id like to review our more detailed roadmap for  beginning with our key business initiatives we drove store productivity higher in  by delivering excellent products and a great customer experience we expect continued gains for  and well get there by continuing to deliver compelling product with high emotional content providing a steady stream of newness to keep the collection fresh expanding our casual collections and further improving the customer experience we will continue to use promotions with restraint and focus on storytelling that lets our customers know whats now and that demonstrate how to create looks which simultaneously speak to their individuality and incorporate the best styles of the season productivity will be further enhanced as we continue to implement our store rationalization program which calls for us to close  retail stores between fiscal  and  primarily at natural lease expirations we are well on our way  stores were closed during fiscal  and another  are scheduled to close during fiscal  in fact  stores have already been closed since the fiscal year began we expect continued growth in our ecommerce business during  all of the instore product is offered online additionally we offer product extensions in the form of additional colors and sizes of products beyond that we will continue to carry online exclusives which enable us to project the express lifestyle free from space constraints our mens branded thirdparty products represent an example of this approach from an operational standpoint we will continue upgrading the ecommerce experience we have enormous opportunities to take advantage of segmentation and greater personalization that could mean many things for example disseminating more personalized emails or delivering customized page views in response to customer searches in conjunction with the deployment of our new order management system we are also relocating our customer service engagement center and our ecommerce fulfillment center specifically our customer service engagement center was just successfully moved to a new facility run by a leader in this space by late spring we expect to have completed the move of our ecommerce fulfillment center to northern kentucky this newlybuilt facility is operated by another bestinclass provider we expect to realize multiple benefits from these two moves we now offer expanded roundtheclock customer service coverage that will better support customer inquiries and the new fulfillment center will be better equipped to respond to volume fluctuations during peak seasons and reduce package transit times turning to outlets we continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of the express factory outlet stores new stores are doing well and the stores open for more than a year are generating positive comps we expect this to continue throughout  we will continue to open new locations at a steady pace we ended  with  outlet stores and have currently identified  locations for new outlets in   of which will be new stores and two of which will be retail store conversions the made for outlet formula is working well for us and we are carefully maintaining product differentiation between our retail and outlet stores to meet the specific needs of the express customer i want to touch briefly on our international operations we have been moving with great care in this area continuing to evaluate and refine our own priorities as it relates to our international presence and the allocation of our resources a number of decisions have been made recently which i want to share with you specifically at this time we are going to concentrate on the americas rather than pursue franchise relationships across the globe we have two franchise relationships in place in this region spanning mexico and latin america and based on our performance in these regions and our broad appeal we believe we have opportunity to grow our business there over the long term this is where we intend to focus our efforts as a direct result of this decision we are winding down our activities in the middle east and south africa the termination of these agreements will not be material to our results and we believe that we should focus our resources on higherreturn activities we sincerely appreciate all of the work and commitment by those franchisees on behalf of our brand we look forward to working with our remaining franchisees to expand our presence in the americas the ability to advance our business initiatives is tied to our operational skill last year i unveiled our top priorities and as noted previously we made important progress against each of them for  they will remain key areas of focus specifically we will continue to evolve our highperformance culture to support our people and attract the best new talent we will continue to provide an exceptional brand and customer experience across all touch points our work to transform and upgrade our systems and processes is continuing and of course from a financial standpoint we expect our positive comp trend to continue we also intend to deliver additional operating margin gains moving up closer to our nearterm doubledigit operating margin goal now id like to turn to our product which is at the heart of our business the womens fall collection was extremely strong with several categories seeing their best year ever the mens business was mixed with some categories growing nicely while others lagged behind our hindsighting continues to provide us with valuable lessons which we have applied to our spring collection we also feel confident that we have identified the key trends for spring and have designed collections which appropriately interpret those trends for our customers customers are responding favorably to our spring products were continuing to emphasize fashion and newness across the womens business and we believe there is real potential to grow categories such as shoes swim and our performance active line exp core into the future we will unveil a new edition collection in june and we continue to be encouraged about the brandenhancing aspects of this elevated capsule collection i also want to note that we recently unveiled our new womens fragrance amaze its only been available for a few weeks so far but we are very pleased with the launch on the mens side our suiting business continues to grow and while our chino business has been growing we are seeing renewed interest in denim we also see a large opportunity across the knit top side of our mens casual business and just last week we rolled out the mens version of our successful one eleven collection it launched in  stores and online like the womens product its soft casual and easy to wear we expect it to appeal to all of our guys making this a great new casual offering for us the collection carries attractive price points starting at  and we intend to exclude promotions from the collection to preserve merchandise margins turning to marketing in late february we launched the express yourself campaign we are once again using targeted tv spots in addition to print this time around we collaborated with the world recognized fashion photographers inez and vinoodh to create a campaign featuring the highprofile model natasha poly throughout the year we intend to continue working with additional highprofile models celebrities and bloggers who do a terrific job of showcasing our product and building buzz among consumers in terms of our mens brand ambassadors we couldnt have been happier with steph curry but our time with him has come to an end were equally excited about our newest mens brand ambassadors kris bryant the yearold chicago cubs third baseman was the  national league rookie of the year he is an inspirational individual and a perfect representation of our brand of course the programs i just called out make up a small piece of a much larger marketing initiative other activities will be taking place throughout the year with each one designed to bring new customers into the brand and deepen our relationship with our existing customers let me conclude with a few observations ive been in my current role for over a year now and it has been a wonderful experience the changes we put in place last year enabled us to deliver better product a better customer experience and significantly improved financial results they also set the stage for continued success we continue to deliver the fashion our customers want and to drive the best possible experience for our customers whether they are shopping in our retail stores online via desktop tablet or mobile devices or visiting our outlet stores were bringing new discipline to our sourcing and inventory management practices and are enforcing a heightened level of financial discipline across the organization beyond this heightened process and production discipline lie additional opportunities related to collections such as express one eleven edition and our thirdparty brands in the aggregate these and other initiatives mentioned earlier this morning provide a platform for improved shareholder returns finally i want to share with the entire express team that im profoundly grateful for their support hard work and terrific results and for their advocacy on behalf of this amazing company and brand id like now to turn the call over to perry perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you david good morning everyone i want to join david in noting how pleased i am with our fourth quarter results the game plan we adopted at the beginning of  to approach growth in a disciplined and balanced way contributed to last years successes and will remain as the foundation for growth in  with respect to the fourth quarter im going to spend a minute on financial highlights net sales grew by  comparable sales grew by  which exceeded our guidance we grew merchandise margins by  basis points through a stronger fashion assortment inventory discipline coupled with improved speed in our supply chain and discipline around promotional activity buying and occupancy as a percent of sales improved by  basis points as our  comp enabled us to leverage costs collectively merchandise margin and buying and occupancy improvement enabled us to expand gross margin by  basis points sga came in at  of net sales as expected we deleveraged sga by  basis points as a result of performancerelated incentive compensation outlet offerings and it investments we had another quarter of significant operating income and margin gains operating income rose  to  million this led to a  basis point gain in operating margin which came in at  net income grew by  to  million diluted earnings per share climbed  during the quarter to  i am equally pleased with our performance for fiscal  as the momentum of the first quarter continued throughout the year in total net sales of  billion increased by  and we generated a  increase in comparable sales the topline growth coupled with various operating initiatives enabled us to grow merchandise margins by  basis points and bo by  basis points which resulted in a gross margin of  a gain of  basis points lastly operating margin improved by  basis points to get us  rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by  to  so it was a year of substantial progress our balance sheet remains very healthy cash and cash equivalents at yearend were  million versus  million last year as a reminder we used  million to redeem our senior notes early in  erasing all debt from our balance sheet we also invested  million in fiscal  to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase plan with  million of that amount repurchased during the fourth quarter fiscal  capital expenditures came in at  million yearend inventory totaled  million representing a  increase over the same time last year this included approximately  million of express factory outlet inventory a significant portion of which relates to new stores with respect to our retail business inventory decreased  in the aggregate we are comfortable with both the level and composition of our inventory next let me turn to our it projects our systems implementations are on track to roll out as discussed on our last call specifically the new order management system is expected to be launched in may the retail management and enterprise planning systems are scheduled to come online in late july by the end of july well have the vast majority of our systemsrelated investments behind us one final program still to be undertaken is our assortment planning system which is scheduled to come online in  at that time well have completed the last major project in our multiyear systems upgrade as our teams become progressively more comfortable working with these systems and more fully utilize their enhanced capability we expect to realize both operational and financial benefits over the next couple of years the final topic i want to address is our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal  for the first quarter of  we currently expect to deliver low singledigit comparable sales growth adjusted net income in the range of  million to  million and adjusted earnings per share in the range of  to  per diluted share since the year began we have repurchased approximately  million of our common stock which brings our first quarter estimated diluted share count to  million shares this latest share repurchases leave  million remaining in our  million share repurchase program i also want to inform you of an item that will impact our first quarter gaap results we recently entered into an agreement with the landlord of our times square store allowing the landlord to market the space and terminate our lease early if or when an alternative tenant is identified upon execution of this agreement in q we recorded an expense of approximately  million which will impact our gaap net income because of the onetime nature of this expense it is not included in our guidance if the landlord actually terminates the lease early additional accounting increase and certain cash payments will be triggered including the reversal of the straightline rent accrual related to the store this will result in future period income of approximately  million therefore the aggregate  impact is expected to be less than a  million loss and could spread over multiple quarters of the year depending upon the timing of the potential transaction i want to reiterate that due to the nonrecurring nature of this transaction we have excluded its impact from our first quarter and fiscal  guidance turning to fiscal  we expect comparable sales to increase in the lowsingledigit range adjusted net income to range from  million to  million adjusted eps to range from  to  per diluted share based on  million diluted shares outstanding as  began weve spoken to you about our objective of returning to doubledigit operating margins within the next few years this was off a base of  in  we laid out a multiyear path that included approximately  basis points of merchandise margin gains approximately  basis points of bo leverage and approximately  basis points of sga leverage what we actually accomplished in  was to grow our operating margin by  basis points to close out the year at  merchandise margin alone increased by  basis points and bo leverage by  basis points were certainly pleased to have reached our target in those two areas more quickly than anticipated on a fullyear basis for  we expect a slight increase in our merchandise margin we will continue to pursue opportunities to drive additional gains in the future by focusing on optimizing inventory levels leveraging our new systems once they go live to have the right product in the right places and by advancing our omnichannel initiatives we believe this additional margin benefit should materialize in  and beyond moving on to bo additional leverage is expected in  although the magnitude is expected to be more modest than last year based on our  comparable sales expectations we anticipate that sga as a percent of sales will remain relatively flat as we continue to invest in outlets marketing activities and our it programs and absorb the impact of high levels of depreciation once the oms and the rms systems are brought online in summary we expect to generate higher operating margins in  and further advance towards our goal of achieving  operating margins within a few years lastly in terms of guidance our capital expenditures are expected to range from  million to  million as we continue investing in new outlet stores and our it systems overhaul at this time id like to turn the call back to david david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you perry  was a strong year we introduced a set of initiatives designed to improve our performance and to return express to a growth trajectory we executed against each of them which encompassed such diverse tasks as delivering more compelling product with emotional content reducing promotions and expanding the brand reach of course with  behind us what matters is what we do this year i want to assure you that everyone in this organization is laserfocused on the importance of continuing to enhance the express brand driving sales comps and earnings growth and maintaining a high degree of discipline across all facets of our operations we believe we have laid out a path to advance us on our journey towards a doubledigit operating margin and enhanced shareholder value before beginning our qa marisa has one quick announcement marisa f jacobs  vice president investor relations thank you david i would like to request that qa participants limit themselves to one question and one followup so that we can get to everyone in the queue operator please open the line so we can begin the questionandanswer portion of the call questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session thank you our first question comes from the line of adrienne yih with wolfe research please proceed with your question adrienne yih tennant  wolfe research llc good morning congratulations on a great year and a great end to the year and quite frankly what sounds david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you adrienne adrienne yih tennant  wolfe research llc looks like the momentum is continuing so david i actually saw the tv ad the other night it looks great i was just wondering if you could talk about the timing the marketing spend ad spend and the timing of that this year over last year given the earlier spring break are there any dollar differences or duration differences there and did then perry  million – this is my followup is really on the gross – on the gross margin is that an occupancy expense or is it a onetime operating down in sga and then can you help us after that q how do we look at the gross margin underlying trend i assume its going to be up just given everything you talked about but can you quantify that for us thank you so much david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director hi adrienne its david first of all in terms of the tv ad we dont go into the specific marketing spend and how we are going to apportion it by month but really in terms of our overall marketing spend we dont see that changing for the quarter or for the year as a percentage of the total and we see it somewhere around the  total mark exciting ad and its going to be running right the way through the end of march adrienne yih tennant  wolfe research llc great david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director perry perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so in regards to your question around  million the  million will be in the bo and the  million will be below the operating income but above profit before taxes as far as gross margin goes we would expect to expand gross margin for  adrienne yih tennant  wolfe research llc fantastic best of luck david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thanks operator our next question comes from the line of john morris with bmo please proceed with your question john dygert morris  bmo capital markets united states thanks my congratulations to everybody as well both on the quarter and the year really a lot of progress guys david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thanks john john dygert morris  bmo capital markets united states first question david you mentioned you walked through the initiatives which was really helpful for the coming year and obviously youve already been doing some of those but i think it was maybe point number two can you give us a little bit more color on specifically the one referring to testing and speed to market how thats changed andor changing specifically to flows and fashion newness and then maybe a little bit more color on the mens business where were seeing a fair amount of improvement here even as we begin the year in things like exp core the tech polo shirts really a lot of newness there and what to expect and what those initiatives are in mens david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director great okay so i will start off briefly with the mens business yes we are delivering a lot more newness in mens we are taking a lot of the learnings that weve achieved on the womens side of the business over the past year and were applying that to the mens side of the business so its frequency and introduction of newness its going to be a lot of the new collection but in addition its focusing on getting progress in our existing businesses as they are on the mens side im encouraged by what were seeing going into q on mens which is the good news and we plan to continue down that path one eleven has only been out for a week in mens but very pleased in terms of the sales that were seeing your first question was really about testing and what changes weve made to that process yeah look overall we are still testing  to  of the units that we sell so that hasnt changed at all i think that we are really focused on testing the core key items that are driving the total business and were not allowing that to prevent us from introducing newness as quickly as possible and ensuring that we are absolutely on the mark and on point with fashion having said that our inventory discipline is enabling us to get more newness in more frequently and clearly our supply chain agility is also helping us as well so were fasttracking product and were able to do that because of some of the platforming of fabrics that weve been doing over the past year and when i talk about that i really mean about prepositioning fabrics and capacity so that were able to get into it very very quickly john dygert morris  bmo capital markets united states thanks good luck for the rest of spring david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thanks a lot john operator our next question comes from the line of simeon siegel with nomura please proceed with your question simeon a siegel  nomura securities international inc thanks good morning guys congrats on a strong year and a good start to this one david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thanks simeon simeon a siegel  nomura securities international inc so david with the success of the new capsule this year and the disciplined promotions can you just talk about your thoughts around aur and maybe the longerterm merch margin opportunities and then perry just as a followup it sounds like the fullyear guidance embeds costs in the coming year from systems i think you called it depreciation did the guidance embed any of the benefits as those systems go live thanks perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so simeon to answer your first question around what weve seen in q in terms of aur trends and overall metrics so in q what weve seen is our adas  increasing weve seen conversion increases during the q and we saw some slight traffic declines during the q to answer the second part of your question regarding does our guidance expect any merchandise margin improvements because of the system implementations at this point the  guidance does not contemplate any of the benefits of the system implementations and thats on the prepared remarks weve mentioned about slight increases in merchandise margin in  matthew c moellering  chief operating officer  executive vice president and simeon this is matt we do believe there is opportunity for margin expansion with these new systems over time what were doing is taking a crawl walk run approach to these systems given the complexity of the system implementations and so we want to get the systems up and stabilized and then start to enjoy the benefits associated with them but these new systems can be a significant enabler for us over the long term we believe that with these new systems we will be able to plan at a much more granular level by channel getting the product to the customer where they want it and how they want it this also lays the foundation to enable us to start to implement the omnichannel initiatives that are out there that should also improve margin as well as topline sales and finally personalization and segmentation will be enabled by these new system implementations as well and weve been investing in content management systems campaign management systems to go along with these rms and oms implementations and we are in the process of knitting all of these together for a pilot in q and then launch in the first half of  where we really can start enjoying some of these benefits simeon a siegel  nomura securities international inc perfect thanks a lot guys best of luck for the rest of the year david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of neely tamminga with piper jaffray please proceed with your question neely j n tamminga  piper jaffray  co broker good morning and congratulations on phenomenal results last year david and team david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you neely j n tamminga  piper jaffray  co broker hey i have a question on mens so you characterize mens as being somewhat mixed last year was it as easy as like a tops versus bottoms sort of dynamic that maybe there was more opportunity in tops versus bottoms and i guess where were going with this is on one eleven being primarily a topsdriven sort of initiative is that a possibility to see a pretty significant reacceleration here in the mens business overall and then a followup question for perry again on da for  for this year what are we planning for da as well as tax rate that would be great thanks david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director so in answer to your first question neely the response would be yes and yes it is really a tops – has been a topsrelated issue and i think the one eleven gives us big opportunity we have made progress we are starting to show signs of making really good progress in mens shirts driven by our casual assortment but were also seeing it in terms of our weartowork side as well so overall i think im encouraged by what im seeing across all of tops so whether its woven shirts whether its knit tops or whether its in graphic tees perry perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so as it relates to the depreciation and amortization for  were planning the year a bit higher than where it came in in  were expecting depreciation to be at approximately  million and as it relates to our overall tax rate for the year we are expecting the tax rate to be approximately  neely j n tamminga  piper jaffray  co broker thank you best wishes perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jay sole with morgan stanley please proceed with your question jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question my first question david is about the express active line that you mentioned the new line can you tell us a little bit about how – what that line might be like and how it differs from some of the stuff you did a couple years ago and then secondly on capex can you talk about maybe from the  million to  million how that breaks up into spending by outlets and it systems and some of the other initiatives and where you see capex going forward into  and beyond thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director jay sorry you broke up when you were talking about active could you just repeat that part of the question jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc oh sorry david i just wanted to know what can you tell us more about that line like what it might look like – look like the fabrications or different style it might have and how it compares to stuff that was from a couple years ago that was kind of active inspired david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director right well i think weve made real progress on our exp core we launched it in january in  stores the stores that had it last year which i think was  stores had it last year  business very well in january and based on the reads that we are seeing we are optimistic about expanding that line further so very pleased and i think that the reason were seeing progress particularly in that line is the fashion that were offering but in addition to the fashion its the fit weve made major improvements to the fit of the garments and shes responding very very well indeed to it so were optimistic about what it offers us for the future perry perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president as it relates to the capex in terms of – in  we expect approximately lets call it about  million to be spent on real estate and the remaining to be spent on our it initiatives and miscellaneous other projects and we think the real estate a lot of that money will be spent on remodeling stores as well as our new outlet locations as it relates to our goforward capital expenditures we would expect in  the capital expenditures to come closer to the  million mark and thereafter based on todays plans is to be below the  million mark between  million and  million jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc got it thanks so much perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thanks jay operator our next question comes from the line of betty chen with mizuho please proceed with your question betty chen  mizuho securities usa inc oh thanks good morning and congratulations on a great quarter and a wonderful year i was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the supply chain aspect i know david you just said the team had done a great job of prepositioning shortening the lead time any more opportunities on that front that could further help your speed and control inventory my followup question was regarding the specific product expectations  on average how should we think about the margin profile of core swim fragrance et cetera relative to the existing business in terms of merch margin opportunity thanks david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director so weve made real progress betty in terms of speed over the past year weve reviewed and scrutinized all our processes really around the responsibilities the positioning the calendars that we use and weve delivered significant improvements in speed and improved our vendor collaboration so i think that yes therere still major opportunities we are comfortably looking at ways on which we can improve it we are constantly looking at ways in which we can improve it we targeted certain departments over the past year and we have seen major benefits in those departments as a result of the work that weve done and this year we are looking to expand that further perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so as it relates to the specific categories  our expectation of the overall merchandise margin is to be similar to the overall companys merchandise margin betty chen  mizuho securities usa inc great thank you so much best of luck david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you betty operator our next question comes from the line of janet kloppenburg with jjk research please proceed with your question janet j kloppenburg  jjk research good morning everyone congratulations great year great quarter david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you janet janet j kloppenburg  jjk research i was wondering if you could help us understand the impact that one eleven might have on comps this year i think it was only in a handful of stores in the first quarter and maybe not that many in the second quarter and also the product line has been broadened significantly since it was first introduced so could we look for that to be a comp motivator for the rest of the year and when you think about your new product category introductions could they be as sizable as one eleven has turned out to be and perry if i look at your guidance at the highend and incorporate a flat sga ratio i think gross margin is going to have to be up anywhere from  basis points to  basis points  basis points – well  basis points to  basis points and im wondering how much of that might be from leverage and occupancy and how much of that might be from improved merchandise margin and auc benefit thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director so janet just to be clear you asked whether one eleven could be a comp driver throughout the year were very pleased janet j kloppenburg  jjk research well i think it was only in a few stores and not anywhere – the sku count was much smaller david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director yeah we rolled it out in july to the chain last year and in march it was in  stores and online clearly we are delighted with the performance that we have seen from one eleven and we expect that to continue but we have built all of this into our guidance for the quarter and for the year in terms of the way in which we found it in terms of new categories – new categories as big as one eleven yes were seeing terrific growth in shoes we see swim the – a great opportunity for us going forward and as i said on the call were going to deliver another collection of edition in june and we see that as also an opportunity for us going forward perry perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so janet looking at the overall  guidance to your point assuming with an sga being flat were expecting bo to leverage given our comp guidance call it approximately about  basis points and then we expect the overall gross margin being up between  basis points to  basis points given the merchandise margin expansion that we have currently anticipating for  now as david mentioned during the call that were expecting modest merchandise margin expansion but that doesnt necessarily mean that were not going to continue to look for opportunities to expand our margins by pulling back on promotions and also by our improved product offering and at this point also were not expecting any improvements driven by auc janet j kloppenburg  jjk research so you dont expect auc improvement because of cotton perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president at this point were expecting auc to be relatively flat given by one the mix of the merchandise we see in our assortment and also moving towards more synthetics janet j kloppenburg  jjk research okay thank you very much perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thanks janet operator our next question comes from the line of marni shapiro with the retail tracker please proceed with your question marni shapiro  the retail tracker hey everybody congratulations the stores have looked absolutely fantastic david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you marni marni shapiro  the retail tracker can you just give us a quick update on – you are rolling out all of these systems how is it or when will it start to impact the loyalty program and your credit card and im curious what the penetration is of the loyalty program today matthew c moellering  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes so the systems – so we have – one we have implemented some of the foundational systems on the financial side the hr side and on the warehouse management side of the business successfully already the big programs we have remaining are oms enterprise planning and rms or retail management system those should be – will be complete by the end of july and once we get them up and stabilized we will then start to use that as a foundation for other activities as i talked about such as the omnichannel initiatives so the real benefits most likely will come in late  but were really counting on them to start coming in in  marni shapiro  the retail tracker so even things like the loyalty programs that all falls into  matthew c moellering  chief operating officer  executive vice president so we have a loyalty program out there right now what we are really focused on is really working on personalization and segmentation of marketing activities and we have implemented a new content management system a new campaign management system along with a new customer data hub those are already in place and we are working on knitting those together which is the last step of the process in conjunction with the rms and enterprise planning and oms initiatives once we get all those together it should give us an ability to significantly increase the personalization and segmentation of our marketing activities which should not only increase the effectiveness of the spend in those areas but also improve the effectiveness of the customer experience as well marni shapiro  the retail tracker okay thanks guys ill follow up with the rest offline david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director marni in addition to that our mens program is very strong and it accounts for a significant amount of our sales we are continuing to make improvement to that and we are going to enhance it this year further so were very pleased with what weve seen from the mens program and believe its going to get stronger going forward marni shapiro  the retail tracker thats what i was sort of trying to get at it seems like its still underdeveloped relative to the marketing breadth that the brand has pushed over the last year david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director yes but we believe that it is a big opportunity for us going forward and it accounts for a significant amount of our sales and a significant amount of our customers and obviously we continue to introduce new people to it but we believe that there are enhancements and improvements that were going to be making to it which will make it even better and thats going to be over the next year marni shapiro  the retail tracker thats great best of luck this spring guys david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you marni operator our next question comes from the line of lindsay drucker mann with goldman sachs please proceed with your question lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co thanks good morning guys i just wanted to follow up given your comp sales target for the year how are you planning your inventories and then secondly as it relates to the flagship you gave us some really helpful details on what financial implications could be but is there a bit more you can tell us about store productivity or profitability to help us handle the model in the event that you do end up closing that flagship store in new york perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so in terms of the inventory question we dont provide guidance for the inventory bidirectionally if you look at the retail inventory we would expect to be flat to down throughout the year for the corresponding boms  what was the second part of your question lindsay lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co i just wanted to talk about the financial implications of the flagship in new york if you do end up giving that lease back beyond just the charges related and the impact of not paying rent how do we think about profitability or the productivity how productive how profitable is that store for you perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so we dont go into specific detail regarding any of our stores overall and the decision with times square to give the landlord the ability to market the space it has to do with the fact that the store didnt meet our initial expectations however we believe right now its the right thing to do to give the landlord the opportunity to look for other tenants lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co okay great one last one do you have an ultimate outlet store target for the us perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president yes we believe that from an outlet standpoint a  store fleet is appropriate for us lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co great thanks so much perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you operator our next question comes from the line of susan anderson with fbr please proceed with your question susan k anderson  fbr capital markets  co good morning congrats on a really good quarter and good year i wanted to maybe get some more color on denim i think you guys said that you saw renewed interest on the mens side maybe if you could talk about what you are seeing on the womens side and then also if you have any color on some early learnings on what the consumers are responding well for for spring and if there is anything they are not resonating with thanks david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director okay so womens continues to be strong in terms of what were seeing were seeing progress across the board in knits woven tops denim dresses casual pants our accessories business is doing very well across all categories including footwear and as i mentioned earlier on the call amaze has got off to a really great start in terms of the launch that weve seen there so overall feel very good about what were seeing in terms of the product goforward for spring in terms of some of the trends that were seeing it sounds strange to say it but its really in terms of what we are seeing is a combination of the s the s and the s in terms of the trends that are out there in terms of whats not resonating look there are areas where we may be a little bit too far in front of the customer whether it is culottes but overall by and large the product is absolutely on the mark and is very good indeed so were seeing some very good results susan k anderson  fbr capital markets  co good sounds great good luck next quarter david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you operator our next question comes from the line of richard jaffe with stifel please proceed with your question richard jaffe  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks very much guys and my compliments too to a very strong quarter if you could just provide some detail for sga and gross margin improvement across the quarters and then talk for a minute about the omnichannel opportunity its obviously very robust already im wondering how you see it continuing to grow dramatically is it the factory outlet business going online or its another factor thank you perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president so looking at the overall gross margin and sga improvement we expect consistent gross margin improvement throughout the quarters for the  and as far as sga goes we would expect sga to be relatively flat throughout the quarters matthew c moellering  chief operating officer  executive vice president for your second question on omnichannel initiatives we currently given the system constraints which will be addressed here shortly we currently do not offer customers reserve online pickup in store for example we also arent able to ship from store today which could help relieve some pockets of inventory that may need to be liquidated things of that nature we do not have those capabilities from an omnichannel standpoint yet and once we have these new systems implemented we will be able to start to go down the path of offering some of these services to our customers richard jaffe  stifel nicolaus  co inc and if you could just follow on with the factory outlet opportunity matthew c moellering  chief operating officer  executive vice president well we are not looking at this time to offer factory outlet product online richard jaffe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of roxanne meyer with mkm partners please proceed with the question roxanne meyer  mkm partners llc great thanks i actually have two followups first as a followup to janets question youve obviously had a ton of success with your one eleven and now youve got edition youve got core im just wondering over the next few years how you think about the balance of all of these new collections relative to the legacy collections how big can all these new collections be as a percent of the mix and then secondly on inventory just wondering if you could help us think about how much more room there is for inventory to be a driver of expanded merchandise margin performance over the next few years and if there are any targets you can share in terms of improving turn thanks a lot david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director okay so your first question is how big some of the new collections can be as a percentage of the total mix we are really in the exploratory phase at the moment in terms of how we take this forward clearly all three of them have the potential to be growth initiatives for us and were looking into it we are building on them were taking it in slow steps youll see in some of our stores how big one eleven has become and we continue to see it as a really big opportunity within the express store as a way of increasing the productivity of our footprint as it is today so very excited by what were seeing there excited about what were seeing in edition and core but i would reiterate we are in the exploratory phases of how we advance those go forward in terms of inventory as a driver of merchandise margin we still see that there is opportunity go forward we are focused on the optimization of our inventory as we have been for the past year but we are putting an even greater emphasis on it in  and we believe that there are merchandise margin gains to be had there as well so were not going to go into the specifics of what that is perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president one thing that i would add is that system implementations will help enhance the inventory optimization that we have in place roxanne meyer  mkm partners llc okay great thanks for the color and best of luck david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thanks roxanne perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rebecca duval with bluefin research please proceed with your question rebecca duval  bluefin research partners inc hi thanks for taking my call and squeezing me in and congratulations also david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thank you rebecca duval  bluefin research partners inc david i just want – youre welcome i just to understand really quick you talked about the initiatives and there has been obviously a lot of questions on these capsules but when you talk about expanding the capsules are you referring to obviously the one eleven and the edition but are you also – does that also encompass some of the product extensions and are you considering or could we look for maybe some additional capsuleslike edition that are more shortterm capsules on a goforward basis and then the second question is also on this whole it implementation obviously i understand the benefits of the omnichannel but is this also going to have a more granular effect on store segmentation in terms of inventory and is that something that we can expect to see this year or is that something that were looking for in  as well thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director okay starting with your first question rebecca in terms of expanding capsules yes its about expanding capsules but its also about product extensions as well so when we look at some of the results that weve seen in footwear we see that footwear is also a major opportunity for us go forward in terms of expanding the footprint in our stores and online as well one eleven as i said on the previous question i believe has very very good opportunity for us as a business but as i said to roxanne were very much in the exploratory stages there and as matt said earlier to an answer on a question its really a crawl walk run approach that were taking we tested in  stores we rolled it out to the chain last july we broadened the assortment this spring were doing various tests this spring in terms of placement within the store and were seeing some really great results from that and we are literally taking it each day as it comes but yes i do believe that there is big opportunity around that and there is big opportunity around general innovation within the business so you talked about edition and one eleven yes there could be other line extensions that we do go forward and other new lines that we deliver into the store and online as well but we are in the sort of imagination imagineering stages of that and were working on it every day ill ask matt to answer the next question matthew c moellering  chief operating officer  executive vice president so from a systems perspective just for perspective the current systems that were operating with which were about to get off of here in a few months the remaining systems these are systems that are  years to  years old extraordinarily old systems when you step back and look at the planning we currently do by channel ecommerce we plan as a single store in our planning system because thats the only ability we have today when we started running our outlet business we effectively have only two departments for mens and womens combined to plan for our outlet business today it is a very difficult customized system that we have to plan the product and the allocation in today these new systems will give us much more granularity to plan by individual channel and get down to the store level as well to enable us to really sharpen where we put product and how we liquidate product as well so we think there are significant opportunities but again these opportunities given that the systems some are going in at the end of – beginning of may and some are going in at the end of july a lot of the benefits will come in  and  rebecca duval  bluefin research partners inc thats very helpful thank you and best of luck matthew c moellering  chief operating officer  executive vice president thank you david g kornberg  president chief executive officer  director thanks rebecca perry v pericleous  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vice president thank you

spoke to you in  i laid out our priorities and we subsequently executed against them the balanced growth i emphasized was achieved and we delivered strong product used promotions with restraint and managed inventories carefully to grow our topline and comparable sales and to improve our margins together these actions enabled us to significantly boost our profitability and set the stage for further gains in for the fourth quarter our sales increased by  our comparable sales increased by  our operating income grew  which in turn lifted our operating margin by  basis points to  our diluted eps grew  to  it was gratifying to turn in a performance that once again exceeded our guidance and marks our fourth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear growthfor the year as a whole our sales increased by  our comparable sales increased by  our operating income grew  which lifted our operating margin by  basis points to  and our adjusted diluted eps grew  to our strong cash flow enabled us to continue investing in our business while also enhancing our capital structure for the benefit of our shareholders to this end during  we used  million to redeem our outstanding debt and repurchase  million worth of our common stockgiven these positive results id like to address what we have achieved and how we have incorporated these processes into our operating principles we achieved many successes last year and i believe express is set up to continue winning let me explain why in  we made some fundamental changes to the way in which we operate our businessfirst our product composition was modified to incorporate more fashion items and to flow in newness more often product categories were expanded and new collections were introduced we now cover a broader spectrum of our customers wardrobe needs and intend to continue down this pathsecond we introduced new disciplines around product testing inventory management and speedtomarket collectively these are bringing better product to our customers faster reducing fashion risk and ensuring a tighter control of inventory and opentobuy dollarsthird we adopted a degree approach to marketing and focused on many new branding activities to drive engagement with our customers we are also partnering with key influencers which is elevating the image of express while much was accomplished last year we have significant opportunity to further build awareness and familiarity as it relates to the express brand and we will seize  these opportunitiesfourth we continue to upgrade our systems and processes significant omnichannel opportunities lie ahead once we transition to new foundational systems fifth we introduced new financial disciplines that created a more balanced financial architecturewe focused on topline growth product margin expansion and expense discipline to ensure that every dollar spent has a clear purpose and that every project undertaken will deliver an appropriate return on the investment we believe this ongoing focus on our financial architecture will drive consistent profitable growth for years to comesixth and lastly we focused on strengthening our balance sheet by repaying our debt we also returned excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program our pristine balance sheet provides us with financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and to continue enhancing shareholder returns those items represent just a few of the many changes put in placeread the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalphacom closex edit favorites enter up to  symbols separated
