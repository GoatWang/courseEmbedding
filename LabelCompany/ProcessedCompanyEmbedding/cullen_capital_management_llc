meltup marketjul  jul   welcome to the post meltup marketin our january  market letter we pointed out that once the back of a meltup market is finally broken there eventually follows a long period of outperformance by value stocks however when an extended meltup ends speculation and momentum do not suddenly stop instead what happens is a period of extreme volatility and erratic stock market behavior which usually takes the market to new highsdownload pdfmarket outlook everyone is underweighted in valuejan  jan   market outlook everyone is underweighted in valuemarket history shows that applying a low pe value discipline to stock selection has rewarded investors with such powerful longterm results it seems inconceivable that they can be underweighted in the strategy the reason is that in a meltup market like the one we just experienced growth stocks and index funds increasingly get bid up over value stocks as the market becomes less and less concerned about risk and valuation however once a meltup market ends a period follows where value dramatically outperforms for a long time below you can see how year after year value outperformed the passive sp  index following two other similar extreme meltup periodsdownload pdfmeltup market updateoct  oct   meltup market updatethe selloff in the third quarter finally broke the back of the meltup market as we have pointed out
