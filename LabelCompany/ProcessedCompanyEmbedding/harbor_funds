interest on us gov securities foreign tax credit information faqs and more  financial glossary reference list of common investing terms  about us the harbor approach we appreciate that there are hundreds of fund companies offering thousands of individual funds from which investors can choose what is different about the harbor approach harbor uses a manager of managers approach to investing instead of hiring a large team of employees to analyze markets research investments and build portfolios across many different asset classes we identify experienced portfolio managers subadvisers with proven track records who specialize in a particular asset class to make all of the daytoday investment decisions for our funds for example we utilize an experienced bond manager like pimco to manage our harbor bond fund and another institutional investment manager with experience in managing growth equities jennison associates to manage our harbor capital appreciation fund harbor capital advisors establishes the objectives and strategies for each fund and closely monitors and evaluates the performance of each fund and its portfolio manager in this way investors in harbor funds have the benefit of both a professional portfolio manager who selects investments on a dayto day basis for each fund and the benefit of a professional adviser in harbor capital advisors that oversees the work of the portfolio manager using this manager of managers approach we believe harbor can offer important benefits to our shareholders including the right manager for the right fund the investment philosophy and strategy that works for one fund or one type of investment wont necessarily work for another by employing independent subadvisers to make the daytoday investment decisions for our funds we believe shareholders benefit from the expertise of a portfolio manager that specializes in a particular investment style or asset class these subadvisers arent tied to a single perspective on the markets that may be out of favor and affect all funds institutionalquality funds for all investors most of our subadvisers work almost exclusively with large sophisticated institutional investors such as corporate and public pension plans their investment services are not always available for most individual investors harbor has taken that institutionallevel expertise however and made it available as a family of mutual funds for institutional and individual investors truly objective fund management each of our subadvisers is independent of harbor this professional relationship with our subadvisers allows us to be unbiased and objective when evaluating their adherence to the funds stated investment strategies and the value they provide to shareholders our subadvisers are trusted business partners not coworkers modest costs our arrangements with subadvisers combined with our internal philosophy of closely managing costs allow us to offer a family of funds that we believe delivers longterm value to our shareholders   harbor funds trustees and officers the harbor funds are overseen by a board of trustees and fund officers name position david g van hooser chairman president and trustee scott m
