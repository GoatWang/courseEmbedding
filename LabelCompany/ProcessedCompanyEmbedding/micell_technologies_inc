alternating using the cleansing water facial wash and moisturizer every night and in less than a week i have soft glowing skin i am really interested to see how the water will work this summer when i

know how important water is for our wellbeing water is the ultimate source of life a vital factor in hydrating our skin but every day we lose it drop by drop things like air conditioning dry weather and sun exposure can leave skin feeling dehydrated and sensitive causes of dehydration humidity humidity levels vary regionally and seasonally when there is low humidity air lacks moisture which impacts on skin hydration levels hard water you often see the signs of hard water in the form of lime scale but cleansing with hard water also leaves traces of these elements on your skin which can cause it to become dehydrated sun the effect of the sun and its powerful uv rays can weaken the skin barrier and contribute to skin dehydration temperature as the temperature drops so do skin hydration levels with cold winds and increased use of heating guilty of drying out skin help protect your skin by following these simple® tips in colder months heating can strip the air of moisture whilst in the warmer months air conditioning can do the same keep skin hydrated over night by filling a bowl with water and put it in your bedroom overnight so that the air conditioning and heating will dry up the water from the bowl rather than your skin exercise is great for boosting blood circulation and providing skin with a glowing appearance however sweating can cause more water loss ultimately making skin feel dry feel the full benefits of a work out by briefly rinsing your face with lukewarm water and immediately moisturizing after exercise for moisturizers to work their best apply them within  minutes of stepping out of the bath or shower to lock in the benefits of water when travelling by air dont be tempted to rinse your face with water  it will only evaporate in the

devices—devices with greater efficacy and enhanced safety profiles that provide better clinical outcomes since  micell has teamed with world renowned medical and scientific innovators to realize our singular vision to lead in the development of advanced vascular medical devices with innovative drug delivery systems as a result we are perfecting our technology to deliver a bestinclass coronary stent system mistent ses our patented drug application methodology is the force behind the success of this system smooth uniform coating micell employs a supercritical fluid technology developed in conjunction with pacific northwest national laboratory a us department of energy laboratory managed by battelle memorial institute this solventfree technology used in applying the polymer component to the stent platform preserves the crystalline integrity of the drug during the coating process fusing the polymer applied using supercritical fluid technology and the dry crystalline form of the drug creates a smooth uniform welladhered coating on the stent unique advantages micell’s coating technology provides unique advantages for the modification and coating of biomedical surfaces with advanced polymers and drugs compared to current solventbased coating processes micell’s technology is solvent free polymers drugs and medical devices are not exposed to conventional liquid solvents that could alter the chemistry of the drug or trigger an inflammatory response in the body preserving moderate temperatures are used to maintain the structure and morphology of therapeutic agents which allows for the use of therapeutic agents that may be sensitive to elevated temperatures or traditional solvent processes adaptable by combining electrostatic attraction with supercritical fluids surface modifications for a broad range of medical devices using a variety of polymers and drugs can be achieved multiple applications micell’s supercritical fluid technology platform has the potential to provide control over drug morphology and the ability to apply multiple therapeutic agents in single or multiple layers to achieve tailored therapeutics allowing the potential for a variety of

mistent ses taking full advantage of  years of stent design learnings mistent ses is designed to limit the duration of polymer exposure optimize healing more precisely and consistently control drug

elazer edelman md phd alexandra lansky md and robbert de winter msc md phd ultrathin design promotes healing mistent ses leverages the strengths of a cobalt chromium coronary stent system a stateoftheart ultrathin strut platform that provides excellent deliverability conformability and flexibility the mistent is  microns in thickness yet does not compromise performance when it comes to longitudinal compression or elongation the thinness of the stent struts helps to minimize vessel damage to the surrounding tissue limits flow disruption decreasing the risk of early stent thrombosis and allows for more rapid reendothelialization while still providing needed support to the artery mistent ses is unique based on its bioabsorbable polymer coating and its use of a crystalline form of sirolimus the polymer is designed to flow away from the stent struts which minimizes tissue reactivity and thus allows for accelerated tissue healing the polymer is eliminated from the stent structure in  to  days and is absorbed from the surrounding tissue within three months the application of crystalline sirolimus to the stent through a proprietary supercritical fluid technology allows for a near linear release of the drug rather than an uncontrolled burst and immediate taper as is often found with other drugeluting stents this sustained release provides therapeutic drug levels well beyond the time it takes for the polymer to be absorbed thereby significantly reducing potential inflammatory response to the polymer itself additionally the sustained controlled drug release provides an antirestenotic effect in the treated area beyond most traditional des products improved clinical outcomes based on clinical evidence the unique design of mistent ses has shown improved clinical outcomes including minimal progression of late lumen loss or neoatheroma formation low target lesion revascularization tlr over longterm followup short duration of polymer presence and even distribution of drug to minimize risk of early and late stent thrombosis drug delivery vs polymer dissolution mistent ses is the only bioabsorbable polymer coated drugeluting stent with active drug present after the polymer is fully absorbed no late catchup of instent late lumen loss lll observed with mistent vs other des progression of lll is seen by many as a surrogate marker for tlr the lower the progression the lower the rate of restenosis over time the unique clinical findings of no lll progression or neoatheroma formation are likely contributors to mistent’s low tlr progression rate

of  by crazycabana from awesome cleanser this is a great product i always use simple products and had never heard of this until the company sent me free sample in the mail and i was very excited to try it out it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean i even used it after using makeup remover wipes to remove my makeup and thought i got all the makeup off but this cleanser took off more that i had no idea was left behind i really love this product and will be purchasing it and would highly recommend it date published  rated  out of  by tinkiebell from fantastic new product i was very pleasantly surprised to find a package from simple in my mailbox on the last day of  inside i found a full sized bottle of their new micellar cleansing water cotton rounds and very generous samples of their moisturizing facial wash and replenishing rich moisturizer i was very skeptical as i read the information and directions for the cleansing water ive tried cleansing wipes in the past and always found that they irritated my skin and left behind a film that needed to be rinsed off which defeated the purpose of a quick easy wipei thought what the heck ive been battling dry skin and a cold and barely made it through my new years eve festivities so the idea of being able to wash my face in one step without even having to leave my bed was very appealingi wet the cotton round and wiped it all over my face and eyes it felt cool and refreshing i was very surprised to look in the mirror and find that all my makeup had been removedmy skin looked clean felt soft  there was no residue i have since been alternating using the cleansing water facial wash and moisturizer every night and in less than a week i have soft glowing skin i am really interested to see how the water will work this summer when i tend to get super sensitive weirdly dry yet oily skin due to the humidity and heat i will also be interested to try their lighter moisturizers as well thanks so much simple for sending me this package and giving me the gift of gorgeous skin date published  rated  out of  by mara from great product i received this product in order to try it and write a review ive been using it for the past week probably for longer than a week since i cant recall the day it surprised me in the mail i should mention that i have combination to oily skin with a very sensitive eye area and i get the usual monthly mini breakout and i live in the caribbean this product performs as advertised leaves skin feeling clean and hydrated it removes my makeup quite well it doesnt irritate my eye area at all it really is as gentle as water it doesnt leave a cast behind like some other products of this cleansing type do i am sooooo thankful of having been sent this full size sample and the two travel size ones that came with it in the mail one is a cleanser the other a moisturizer which also work amazingly i didnt think simple products were a match for my oily skin but i can truthfully say that they have made my skin look and feel clean hydrated and moisturized keep up the good work simple great product if any errors annoy you in my writing my only defense is english is not my first language  date published  rated  out of  by gnut from convienent i received a free sample in exchange for my review i love the micellar cleansing water now i still prefer to wash my face with facial soap but on those nights that its late and im tired but do not want to sleep in my makeup i use this it wipes everything away i feel clean and not overly dried it is scentless and is just like water i would definitely recommend this date published  rated  out of  by leanna from it was not what i was expecting i received this in the mail from simple skincare to try this new micellar water cleanser i was honestly not expecting much from what i thought was just glorified water i was severely wrong my skin has cleared up so much from using not only this product but simple skincare in general i really like the micellar cleaning water because unlike many other cleansers my face no longer feels tight or dry my red irritated and sensitive skin has never felt better after using this product i cant wait to try out other simple skin care products date published  rated  out of  by ajfpnts from lovehate first of all i love the way it feels on my skin since it makes me feel so refreshed the bad thing is that it doesnt remove all makeup specially waterproof the best way to use this in my opinion would be before applying makeup or to remove it when wearing a minimal look date published  rated  out of  by love from perfect everything i could want in a makeup remover date published  rated  out of  by wcc from better than my old stuff i wanted to try something new and saw this on the shelf i even used my normal cleanser and then used this afterwards my face wasnt clean until i used this my face is smooth and fresh and isnt dried out best ever recommend to anyone dont need sensitive skin just a dirty

to oily skin with a very sensitive eye area and i get the usual monthly mini breakout and i live in the caribbean this product performs as advertised leaves skin feeling clean and hydrated it removes my makeup quite well it doesnt irritate my eye area at all it really is as gentle as water it doesnt leave a cast behind like some other products of this cleansing type do i am sooooo thankful of having been sent this full size sample and the two travel size ones that came with it in the mail one is a cleanser the other a moisturizer which also work amazingly i didnt think simple products were a match for my oily skin but i can truthfully say that they have made my skin look and feel clean hydrated and moisturized keep up the good work simple great product if any errors annoy you in my writing my only defense is english is not my first language  date published  rated  out of  by gnut from convienent i received a free sample in exchange for my review i love the micellar cleansing water now i still prefer to wash my face with facial soap but on those nights that its late and im tired but do not want to sleep in my makeup i use this it wipes everything away i feel clean and not overly dried it is scentless and is just like water i would definitely recommend this date published  rated  out of  by leanna from it was not what i was expecting i received this in the mail from simple skincare to try this new micellar water cleanser i was honestly not expecting much from what i thought was just glorified water i was severely wrong my skin has cleared up so much from using not only this product but simple skincare in general i really like the micellar cleaning water because unlike many other cleansers my face no longer feels tight or dry my red irritated and sensitive skin has never felt better after using this product i cant wait to try out other simple skin care products date published  rated  out of  by ajfpnts from lovehate first of all i love the way it feels on my skin since it makes me feel so refreshed the bad thing is that it doesnt remove all makeup specially waterproof the best way to use this in my opinion would be before applying makeup or to remove it when wearing a minimal look date published  rated  out of  by love from perfect everything i could want in a makeup remover date published  rated  out of  by wcc from better than my old stuff i wanted to try something new and saw this on the shelf i even used my normal cleanser and then used this afterwards my face wasnt clean until i used this my face is smooth and fresh and isnt
