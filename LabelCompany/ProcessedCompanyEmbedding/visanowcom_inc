pretty stellarsnacks duhthere has been a lot of change and obviously some people are upset about that regarding job security my sense is that most of the recent turnover has been a result of company adapting strategy for example focusing more on marketing and product development so people actually want to buy it instead of cold calling to land new accounts hr professionals are not receptive to cold calling if they dont know what your product is people finding things they would rather dofine by me just go and be happy a sometimes mutual decision that it wasnt a good fiti would be more worried if the company were stagnant and kept trying the same thing over and over again without getting the desired results then we all would be out of a job im glad the company is adapting and trying
