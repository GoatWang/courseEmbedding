and jack warner they emigrated as young children with their parents to canada from krasnosielc which was located in the part of congress poland that had been subjugated to the russian empire following the eighteenthcentury partitions of poland near presentday ostrołęka jack the youngest was born in london ontario the three elder brothers began in the movie theater business having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of pennsylvania and ohio in the beginning sam and albert warner invested  to present life of an american fireman and the great train robbery they opened their first theater the cascade in new castle pennsylvania in  when the original building was in danger of being demolished the modern warner bros called the current building owners and arranged to save it the owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance in  the warners founded the pittsburghbased duquesne amusement  supply company to distribute films in  harry warner hired an auditor named paul ashley chase by the time of world war i they had begun producing films in  they opened the first warner bros studio on sunset boulevard in hollywood sam and jack produced the pictures while harry and albert along with their auditor and now controller chase handled finance and distribution in new york city during world war i their first nationally syndicated film my four years in germany based on a popular book by former ambassador james w gerard was released on april   with help from money loaned to harry by his banker motley flint they formally incorporated as warner brothers pictures incorporated as late as the s warner bros claimed  as its founding date lobby card from open your eyes  lobby card from the beautiful and damned  the first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to avery hopwoods  broadway play the gold diggers from theatrical impresario david belasco however rin tin tin a dog brought from france after world war i by an american soldier established their reputation rin tin tin debuted in the feature where the north begins the movie was so successful that jack signed the dog to star in more films for  per week rin tin tin became the studios top star jack nicknamed him the mortgage lifter and the success boosted darryl f zanucks career zanuck eventually became a top producer and between  and  served as jacks righthand man and executive producer with responsibilities including daytoday film production more success came after ernst lubitsch was hired as head director harry rapf left the studio to join metrogoldwynmayer lubitschs film the marriage circle was the studios most successful film of  and was on the new york times best list for that year despite the success of rin tin tin and lubitsch warners remained a lesser studio sam and jack decided to offer broadway actor john barrymore the lead role in beau brummel the film was so successful that harry signed barrymore to a longterm contract like the marriage circle beau brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by the times by the end of  warner bros was arguably hollywoods most successful independent studio where it competed with the big three studios first national paramount pictures and mgm as a result harry warner—while speaking at a convention of  independent exhibitors in milwaukee wisconsin—was able to convince the filmmakers to spend  in newspaper advertising and harry saw this as an opportunity to establish theaters in cities such as new york and los angeles as the studio prospered it gained backing from wall street and in  goldman sachs arranged a major loan with this new money the warners bought the pioneer vitagraph company which had a nationwide distribution system in  warners also experimented in radio establishing a successful radio station kfwb in los angeles – sound color style warner bros was a pioneer of films with synchronized sound then known as talking pictures or talkies in  at sams urging warners agreed to add this feature to their productions by february  the studio reported a net loss of  don juan opens warners theatre after a long period denying sams request for sound harry agreed to change as long as the studios use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only the warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company western electric and established vitaphone in  vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks most notably in the feature don juan starring john barrymore the film was silent but it featured a large number of vitaphone shorts at the beginning to hype don juans release harry acquired the large piccadilly theater in manhattan new york city and renamed it warners theatre don juan premiered at the warners theatre in new york on august   throughout the early history of film distribution theater owners hired orchestras to attend film showings where they provided soundtracks through vitaphone warner bros produced eight shorts which aired at the beginning of every showing of don juan across the country in  many film production companies questioned the necessity don juan did not recoup its production cost and lubitsch left for mgm by april  the big five studios first national paramount mgm universal and producers distributing had ruined warners and western electric renewed warners vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound as a result of their financial problems warner bros took the next step and released the jazz singer starring al jolson this movie which has very little sound dialogue but includes sound segments of jolson singing was a sensation it signaled the beginning of the era of talking pictures and the twilight of the silent era however sam died the night before the opening preventing the brothers from attending the premiere jack became sole head of production sams death also had a great effect on jacks emotional state as sam was arguably jacks inspiration and favorite brother in the years to come jack kept the studio under tight control firing employees was common among those whom jack fired were rin tin tin in  and douglas fairbanks jr—who had served as first nationals top star since the brothers acquired the studio in —in  thanks to the success of the jazz singer the studio was cashrich jolsons next film for the company the singing fool was also a success with the success of these first talkies the jazz singer lights of new york the singing fool and the terror warner bros became a top studio and the brothers were now able to move out from the poverty row section of hollywood los angeles and acquire a much larger studio lot in burbank they expanded by acquiring the stanley corporation a major theater chain this gave them a share in rival first national pictures of which stanley owned onethird in a bidding war with william fox warner bros bought more first national shares on september   jack also appointed zanuck as the manager of first national pictures warner bros–first national studios burbank c  in  warner bros released lights of new york the first alltalking feature due to its success the movie industry converted entirely to sound almost overnight by the end of  all the major studios were exclusively making sound films in  first national pictures released their first film with warner bros noahs ark despite its expensive budget noahs ark was profitable in  warner bros released on with the show the first allcolor alltalking feature this was followed by gold diggers of broadway which was so popular it played in theatres until  the success of these two color pictures caused a color revolution just as the first alltalkie had created one for talkies warner bros color films from  to  included the show of shows  sally  bright lights  golden dawn  hold everything  song of the flame  song of the west  the life of the party  sweet kitty bellairs  under a texas moon  bride of the regiment  viennese nights  woman hungry  kiss me again  fifty million frenchmen  and manhattan parade  in addition to these scores of features were released with technicolor sequences as well as numerous technicolor specials short subjects the majority of these color films were musicals in  warner bros bought the st louisbased theater chain skouras brothers following this takeover spyros skouras the driving force of the chain became general manager of the warner brothers theater circuit in america he worked successfully in that post for two years and turned its losses into profits harry produced an adaptation of a cole porter musical titled fifty million frenchmen through first national the studios profit increased substantially after the success of the studios  first national film noahs ark harry agreed to make michael curtiz a major director at the burbank studio mort blumenstock a first national screenwriter became a top writer at the brothers new york headquarters in the third quarter warner bros gained complete control of first national when harry purchased the companys remaining onethird share from fox the justice department agreed to allow the purchase if first national was maintained as a separate company when the great depression hit warner asked for and got permission to merge the two studios soon afterward warner bros moved to the first national lot in burbank though the companies merged the justice department required warner to release a few films each year under the first national name until  for thirty years certain warner productions were identified mainly for tax purposes as a warner bros–first national picture in the latter part of  jack warner hired george arliss to star in disraeli which was a success arliss won an academy award for best actor and went on to star in nine more movies for the studio in  harry acquired more theaters in atlantic city despite the beginning of the great depression in july  the studios banker motley flint was murdered by a disgruntled investor in another company harry acquired a string of music publishers to form warner bros music in april  warner bros acquired brunswick records harry obtained radio companies foreign sound patents and a lithograph company after establishing warner bros music harry appointed his son lewis to manage the company by  the studio began to feel the effects of the depression as the public could no longer afford the tickets the studio reportedly lost  million and an additional  million the following year in  warner bros music head lewis warner died from an infected wisdom tooth around that time zanuck hired screenwriter wilson mizner while at the studio mizner had hardly any respect for authority and found it difficult to work with jack but became an asset as time went by warner became more tolerant of mizner and helped invest in mizners brown derby restaurant on april   mizner died from a heart attack by  audiences had grown tired of musicals and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies the public had begun to associate musicals with color and thus studios began to abandon its use warner bros had a contract with technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process as a result the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio doctor x  and mystery of the wax museum  in the latter part of  harry warner rented the teddington studios in london england the studio focused on making quota quickies for the domestic british market and irving asher was appointed as the studios head producer in  harry officially purchased the teddington studios in february  warner bros produced nd street a very successful musical under the direction of lloyd bacon warner assigned bacon to more expensive productions including footlight parade wonder bar broadway gondolier which he also starred in and gold diggers that saved the company from bankruptcy in the wake of nd streets success the studio produced profitable musicals these starred ruby keeler and dick powell and were mostly directed by busby berkeley in  the revival suffered a major blow when berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk by the end of the year people again tired of warner bros musicals and the studio—after the huge profits made by  film captain blood—shifted its focus to errol flynn swashbucklers – precode realistic period with the collapse of the market for musicals warner bros under zanuck turned to more socially realistic storylines for its many films about gangsters warner bros soon became known as a gangster studio the studios first gangster film little caesar was a great box office success and edward g robinson starred in many of the subsequent warner gangster films the studios next effort the public enemy made james cagney arguably the studios new top star and warner bros made more gangster films james cagney and joan blondell in footlight parade  another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed i am a fugitive from a chain gang based on a true story and starring paul muni joining cagney and robinson as one the studios top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film which convinced audiences to question the american legal system by january  the films protagonist robert elliot burns—still imprisoned in new jersey—and other chain gang prisoners nationwide appealed and were released in january  georgia chain gang warden j harold hardy—who was also made into a character in the film—sued the studio for displaying vicious untrue and false attacks against him in the film after appearing in the warners film the man who played god bette davis became a top star in  relief for the studio came after franklin d roosevelt became president and began the new deal this economic rebound allowed warner bros to again become profitable the same year zanuck quit harry warners relationship with zanuck had become strained after harry strongly opposed allowing zanucks film baby face to step outside hays code boundaries the studio reduced his salary as a result of losses from the great depression and harry refused to restore it as the company recovered zanuck established his own company harry thereafter raised salaries for studio employees in  warner was able to link up with newspaper tycoon william randolph hearsts cosmopolitan films hearst had previously worked with mgm but ended the association after a dispute with head producer irving thalberg over the treatment of hearsts longstanding mistress actress marion davies who was struggling for box office success through his partnership with hearst warner signed davies to a studio contract hearsts company and davies films however did not increase the studios profits in  the studio lost over  million of which  was the result of a  fire at the burbank studio destroying  years worth of early vitagraph warner bros and first national films the following year hearsts film adaption of william shakespeares a midsummer nights dream  failed at the box office and the studios net loss increased during this time harry and six other movie studio figures were indicted for conspiracy to violate the sherman antitrust act through an attempt to gain a monopoly over st louis movie theaters in  harry was put on trial after a mistrial harry sold the companys movie theaters and the case was never reopened  also saw the studio make a net profit of  the studio as seen in the trailer for the petrified forest  by  contracts of musical and silent stars were not renewed replaced by toughtalking workingclass types who better fit these pictures dorothy mackaill dolores del río bebe daniels frank fay winnie lightner bernice claire alexander gray alice white and jack mulhall that had characterized the urban modern and sophisticated attitude of the s gave way to james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson warren william and barbara stanwyck who would be more acceptable to the common man the studio was one of the most prolific producers of precode pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency around  as a result warner bros turned to historical pictures from around  to avoid confrontations with the breen office in  following the success of the petrified forest jack signed humphrey bogart to a studio contract warner however did not think bogart was star material and cast bogart in infrequent roles as a villain opposite either james cagney or edward robinson over the next five years after hal b wallis succeeded zanuck in  and the hays code began to be enforced in  the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic idealized pictures the studios historical dramas melodramas or womens pictures swashbucklers and adaptations of bestsellers with stars like bette davis olivia de havilland paul muni and errol flynn avoided the censors in  bette davis by now arguably the studios top star was unhappy with her roles she traveled to england and tried to break her contract davis lost the lawsuit and returned to america although many of the studios employees had problems with jack warner they considered albert and harry fair code era in the s many actors and actresses disappeared who had characterized the realistic precode era but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures warner bros remained a top studio in hollywood but this changed after  as other studios notably mgm quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized warner bros however in the late s bette davis became the studios top draw and was even dubbed as the fifth warner brother humphrey bogart in the petrified forest  in  cagney sued jack warner for breach of contract cagney claimed warner had forced him to star in more films than his contract required cagney eventually dropped his lawsuit after a cash settlement nevertheless cagney left the studio to establish an independent film company with his brother bill the cagneys released their films though grand national films however they were not able to get good financing and ran out of money after their third film cagney then agreed to return to warner bros after jack agreed to a contract guaranteeing cagney would be treated to his own terms after the success of yankee doodle dandy at the box office cagney again questioned if the studio would meet his salary demand and again quit to form his own film production and distribution company with bill another employee with whom warner had troubles was studio producer bryan foy in  wallis hired foy as a producer for the studios low budget bfilms leading to his nickname the keeper of the bs foy was able to garnish arguably more profits than any other bfilm producer at the time during foys time at the studio however warner fired him seven different times during  the story of louis pasteur proved a box office success and star paul muni won the oscar for best actor in march  the studios  film the life of emile zola gave the studio its first best picture oscar in  the studio hired midwestern radio announcer ronald reagan although reagan was initially a bfilm actor warner bros was impressed by his performance in the final scene of knute rockne all american and agreed to pair him with flynn in santa fe trail  reagan then returned to bfilms after his performance in the studios  kings row warner decided to make reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract tripling his salary in  harrys daughter doris read a copy of margaret mitchells gone with the wind and was interested in making a film adaptation doris offered mitchell  for screen rights jack vetoed the deal realizing it would be an expensive production major paramount star george raft also eventually proved to be a problem for jack warner had signed him in  finally bringing the third top s gangster actor into the warners fold knowing that he could carry any gangster picture when either robinson or cagney were on suspension raft had difficulty working with bogart and refused to costar with him eventually warner agreed to release raft from his contract in  after raft had turned the role down the studio gave bogart the role of mad dog roy earle in the  film high sierra which helped establish him as a top star following high sierra and after raft had once again turned the part down bogart was given the leading role in john hustons successful  remake of the studios  precode film the maltese falcon based upon the dashiell hammett novel warners cartoons main articles warner bros cartoons and warner bros animation warners cartoon unit had its roots in the independent harman and ising studio from  to  disney alumni hugh harman and rudolf ising produced musical cartoons for leon schlesinger who sold them to warner harman and ising introduced their character bosko in the first looney tunes cartoon sinkin in the bathtub and created a sister series merrie melodies in  harman and ising broke away from schlesinger in  due to a contractual dispute taking bosko with them to mgm as a result schlesinger started his own studio leon schlesinger productions which continued with merrie melodies

kitties achieved star power by  the schlesinger studio had surpassed walt disney studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts warner bros eventually bought schlesingers cartoon unit in  and renamed it warner bros cartoons unfortunately the unit was indifferently treated by senior management beginning with the installation of edward selzer as senior producer whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent jack had little regard for the companys short film product and reputedly was so ignorant about the animation division of the studio that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of mickey mouse walt disney productions flagship character he sold off the units preaugust  library for  each which proved a shortsighted transaction in light of its eventual value warner bros cartoons continued with intermittent interruptions until  when it was dissolved as the parent company ceased film shorts entirely characters such as bugs bunny daffy duck tweety bird sylvester and porky pig became central to the companys image in subsequent decades bugs in particular remains a mascot to warner bros its various divisions and six flags which time

upcoming film for columbia pictures warner responded by sending  telegrams to different film production companies warning them not to hire her for any role afterwards de haviland discovered employment contracts in the united states could only last seven years de haviland had been under contract with the studio since  the court ruled in de havilands favor and she left the studio through de havilands victory many of the studios longtime actors were now freed from their contracts and harry decided to terminate the studios suspension policy the same year jack signed newly released mgm actress joan

case of the s this action brought by the justice department and the federal trade commission claimed the five integrated studiotheater chain combinations restrained competition the supreme court heard the case in  and ruled for the government as a result warner and four other major studios were forced to separate production from exhibition in  the studios net profit was only  million warner bros had two semiindependent production companies that released films through the studiocitation needed one of these was sperlings united states pictures vivien leigh as blanche dubois in a streetcar named desire  in the early s the threat of television emerged in  jack decided to copy united artists successful d film bwana devil releasing his own d films beginning with house of wax however d films soon lost their appeal among moviegoers d almost caused the demise of the warner bros cartoon studio having completed a d bugs bunny cartoon lumber jackrabbit jack warner ordered the animation unit to be shut down erroneously believing that all cartoons hence would be produced in the d process several months later warner relented and reopened the cartoon studio fortunately warner bros had enough of a backlog of cartoons and a healthy reissue program so that there was no noticeable interruption in the release schedule in  warner bros made their first film carson city in warnercolor the studios name for eastmancolor after the downfall of d films harry warner decided to use cinemascope in future warner bros films one of the studios first cinemascope films the high and the mighty owned by john waynes company batjac enabled the studio to show a profit early in  warners theater holdings were spun off as stanley warner theaters stanley warners nontheater holdings were sold to simon fabian

and  million on february   jack warner sold the rights to all of his pre films to associated artists productions which merged with united artists television in  and was subsequently acquired by turner broadcasting system in early  as part of a failed takeover of mgmua by ted turner in may  the brothers announced they were putting warner bros on the market jack secretly organized a syndicate—headed by boston banker serge semenenko– to purchase  of the stock after the three brothers sold jack—through his underthetable deal—joined semenenkos syndicate and bought back all his stock shortly after the deal was completed in july jack—now the companys largest stockholder—appointed himself its new president shortly after the deal closed jack announced the company and its subsidiaries would be directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties talents and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible warner bros television and warner bros records by  with the success of television threatening the film industry more and more harry warner decided to emphasize television production however the federal communications commission fcc would not permit it after an unsuccessful attempt to convince other movie studio bosses to switch harry abandoned his television efforts jack had problems with milton berles unsuccessful film always leave them laughing during the peak of berles television popularity warner felt that berle was not strong enough to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free however jack was pressured into using berle replacing danny kaye with him berles outrageous behavior on the set and the films massive failure led to jack banning television sets from film sets james garner and jack kelly in maverick  on march   the studio was finally able to engage in television through the successful warner bros television unit run by william t orr jack warners soninlaw warner bros television provided abc with a weekly show warner bros presents the show featured rotating shows based on three film successes kings row casablanca and cheyenne followed by a promotion for a new film it was not a success the studios next effort was to make a weekly series out of cheyenne cheyenne was televisions first hourlong western two episodes were placed together for feature film release outside the united states in the tradition of their b pictures the studio followed up with a series of rapidly produced popular westerns such as writerproducer roy huggins critically lauded maverick as well as sugarfoot bronco lawman the alaskans and colt  the success of these series helped to make up for losses in the film business as a result jack decided to emphasize television production warners produced a series of popular private detective shows beginning with  sunset strip – followed by hawaiian eye – bourbon street beat  and surfside six – within a few years the studio provoked hostility among their tv stars such as clint walker and james garner who sued over a contract dispute and won edd byrnes was not so lucky and bought himself out of his contract jack was angered by their perceived ingratitude who evidently showed more independence than film actors deepening his contempt for the new medium many of warners television stars appeared in the casts of warners cinema releases in  a court decision forced warners to end contracts with their television stars engaging them for specific series or film rolescitation needed in  jack webb was the head of warners tv division  dean martin and frank sinatra warner bros was already the owner of extensive musicpublishing holdings whose tunes had appeared in countless cartoons arranged by carl stalling and television shows arranged by max steiner in  the studio launched warner bros records initially the label released recordings made by their television stars—whether they could sing or not—and records based on television soundtracks in  warner agreed to a rescue takeover of frank sinatras reprise records the deal gave sinatra us million and part ownership of warner bros records making reprise a sublabel most significantly the deal brought reprise manager morris mo ostin into the company in  upon seeing the profits record companies made from warner film music warner decided to claim ownership of the studios film soundtracks in its first eighteen months warner bros records lost around  million new owners warner bros rebounded in the late s specializing in adaptations of popular plays like the bad seed  no time for sergeants  and gypsy  while he slowly recovered from a car crash that occurred while vacationing in france in  jack returned to the studio and made sure his name was featured in studio press releases from  the studios annual net profit was a little over  million warner paid an unprecedented  million for the film rights to the broadway musical my fair lady in february  the previous owner cbs director william s paley set terms including half the distributors gross profits plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract in  the studios net profit dropped to  million by the mids motion picture production was in decline as the industry was in the midst of a painful transition from the golden age of hollywood to the era now known as new hollywood few studio films were made in favor of coproductions for which warner provided facilities money and distribution and pickups of independent pictures with the success of the studios  film of broadway play my fair lady as well as its soundtrack warner bros records became a profitable subsidiary the  film whos afraid of virginia woolf was a huge success in november  jack gave in to advancing age and changing times selling control of the studio and music business to seven arts productions run by canadian investors elliot and kenneth hyman for  million the company including the studio was renamed warner brosseven arts warner remained president until the summer of  when camelot failed at the box office and warner gave up his position to his longtime publicity director ben kalmenson warner remained on board as an independent producer and vicepresident with the  success of bonnie and clyde warner bros was again profitable two years later the hymans were tired and fed up with jack warner and his actions they accepted a cashandstock offer from kinney national company for more than  million kinney owned a hollywood talent agency ashleyfamous whose founder ted ashley led kinney head steve ross to purchase warner bros ashley became the studio head and changed the name to warner bros inc once again jack warner was outraged by the hymans sale and decided to retire until his death from serious health complications of heart inflammation in august  although movie audiences had shrunk warners new management believed in the drawing power of stars signing coproduction deals with several of the biggest names of the day including paul newman robert redford barbra streisand and clint eastwood carrying the studio successfully through the s and s warner bros also made major profits on films and television shows built around the characters of superman batman and wonder woman owned by warner bros subsidiary dc comics abandoning parking lots and funeral homes the refocused kinney renamed itself in honor of its bestknown holding warner communications throughout the s and s warner communications branched out into other business such as video game company atari inc in  and later the six flags theme parks from  until the end of  warners international distribution operations were a joint venture with columbia pictures in some countries this joint venture distributed films from other companies such as emi films and cannon films in the uk warner ended the venture in  and partnered with walt disney pictures this joint venture lasted until  when disney created buena vista international in  in a costcutting move warner and columbia formed a third company called the burbank studios tbs they would share the warner lot in burbank both studios technically became production entities giving tbs daytoday responsibility for studio grounds and upkeep the columbia ranch about a mile north of warners lot was part of the deal the warnercolumbia relationship was acrimonious but the reluctance of both studios to approve or spend money on capital upgrades that might only help the other did have the unintended consequence of preserving the warner lots primary function as a filmmaking facility while it produced relatively little during the s and s most films produced after  were filmed on location after the failure of camelot was partially attributed to the fact it was set in england but obviously filmed in burbank with control over its own lot tied up in tbs warner ultimately retained a significant portion of its backlot while fox sold its backlot to create century city universal turned part of its backlot into a theme park and shopping center and disney replaced its backlot with office buildings and exiled its animation department to an industrial park in glendale in  a solution to the situation became evident when warner bros acquired lorimartelepictures and gained control of the former mgm studio lot in culver city and that same year sony bought columbia pictures sony was flush with cash and warner bros now had two studio lots in  tbs ended when sony bought the mgm lot from warner and moved columbia to culver city however warner kept the columbia ranch now known as the warner bros ranch warner communications merged in  with whiteshoe publishing company time inc time claimed a higher level of prestige while warner bros provided the profits the time warner merger was almost derailed when paramount communications formerly gulfwestern later sold to viacom launched a  billion hostile takeover bid for time inc forcing time to acquire

wonskolaser or wonsal before anglicization harry albert sam and jack warner they emigrated as young children with their parents to canada from krasnosielc which was located in the part of congress poland that had been subjugated to the russian empire following the eighteenthcentury partitions of poland near presentday ostrołęka jack the youngest was born in london ontario the three elder brothers began in the movie theater business having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of pennsylvania and ohio in the beginning sam and albert warner invested  to present life of an american fireman and the great train robbery they opened their first theater the cascade in new castle pennsylvania in  when the original building was in danger of being demolished the modern warner bros called the current building owners and arranged to save it the owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance in  the warners founded the pittsburghbased duquesne amusement  supply company to distribute films in  harry warner hired an auditor named paul ashley chase by the time of world war i they had begun producing films in  they opened the first warner bros studio on sunset boulevard in hollywood sam and jack produced the pictures while harry and albert along with their auditor and now controller chase handled finance and distribution in new york city during world war i their first nationally syndicated film my four years in germany based on a popular book by former ambassador james w gerard was released on april   with help from money loaned to harry by his banker motley flint they formally incorporated as warner brothers pictures incorporated as late as the s warner bros claimed  as its founding date lobby card from open your eyes  lobby card from the beautiful and damned  the first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to avery hopwoods  broadway play the gold diggers from theatrical impresario david belasco however rin tin tin a dog brought from france after world war i by an american soldier established their reputation rin tin tin debuted in the feature where the north begins the movie was so successful that jack signed the dog to star in more films for  per week rin tin tin became the studios top star jack nicknamed him the mortgage lifter and the success boosted darryl f zanucks career zanuck eventually became a top producer and between  and  served as jacks righthand man and executive producer with responsibilities including daytoday film production more success came after ernst lubitsch was hired as head director harry rapf left the studio to join metrogoldwynmayer lubitschs film the marriage circle was the studios most successful film of  and was on the new york times best list for that year despite the success of rin tin tin and lubitsch warners remained a lesser studio sam and jack decided to offer broadway actor john barrymore the lead role in beau brummel the film was so successful that harry signed barrymore to a longterm contract like the marriage circle beau brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by the times by the end of  warner bros was arguably hollywoods most successful independent studio where it competed with the big three studios first national paramount pictures and mgm as a result harry warner—while speaking at a convention of  independent exhibitors in milwaukee wisconsin—was able to convince the filmmakers to spend  in newspaper advertising and harry saw this as an opportunity to establish theaters in cities such as new york and los angeles as the studio prospered it gained backing from wall street and in  goldman sachs arranged a major loan with this new money the warners bought the pioneer vitagraph company which had a nationwide distribution system in  warners also experimented in radio establishing a successful radio station kfwb in los angeles – sound color style warner bros was a pioneer of films with synchronized sound then known as talking pictures or talkies in  at sams urging warners agreed to add this feature to their productions by february  the studio reported a net loss of  don juan opens warners theatre after a long period denying sams request for sound harry agreed to change as long as the studios use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only the warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company western electric and established vitaphone in  vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks most notably in the feature don juan starring john barrymore the film was silent but it featured a large number of vitaphone shorts at the beginning to hype don juans release harry acquired the large piccadilly theater in manhattan new york city and renamed it warners theatre don juan premiered at the warners theatre in new york on august   throughout the early history of film distribution theater owners hired orchestras to attend film showings where they provided soundtracks through vitaphone warner bros produced eight shorts which aired at the beginning of every showing of don juan across the country in  many film production companies questioned the necessity don juan did not recoup its production cost and lubitsch left for mgm by april  the big five studios first national paramount mgm universal and producers distributing had ruined warners and western electric renewed warners vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound as a result of their financial problems warner bros took the next step and released the jazz singer starring al jolson this movie which has very little sound dialogue but includes sound segments of jolson singing was a sensation it signaled the beginning of the era of talking pictures and the twilight of the silent era however sam died the night before the opening preventing the brothers from attending the premiere jack became sole head of production sams death also had a great effect on jacks emotional state as sam was arguably jacks inspiration and favorite brother in the years to come jack kept the studio under tight control firing employees was common among those whom jack fired were rin tin tin in  and douglas fairbanks jr—who had served as first nationals top star since the brothers acquired the studio in —in  thanks to the success of the jazz singer the studio was cashrich jolsons next film for the company the singing fool was also a success with the success of these first talkies the jazz singer lights of new york the singing fool and the terror warner bros became a top studio and the brothers were now able to move out from the poverty row section of hollywood los angeles and acquire a much larger studio lot in burbank they expanded by acquiring the stanley corporation a major theater chain this gave them a share in rival first national pictures of which stanley owned onethird in a bidding war with william fox warner bros bought more first national shares on september   jack also appointed zanuck as the manager of first national pictures warner bros–first national studios burbank c  in  warner bros released lights of new york the first alltalking feature due to its success the movie industry converted entirely to sound almost overnight by the end of  all the major studios were exclusively making sound films in  first national pictures released their first film with warner bros noahs ark despite its expensive budget noahs ark was profitable in  warner bros released on with the show the first allcolor alltalking feature this was followed by gold diggers of broadway which was so popular it played in theatres until  the success of these two color pictures caused a color revolution just as the first alltalkie had created one for talkies warner bros color films from  to  included the show of shows  sally  bright lights  golden dawn  hold everything  song of the flame  song of the west  the life of the party  sweet kitty bellairs  under a texas moon  bride of the regiment  viennese nights  woman hungry  kiss me again  fifty million frenchmen  and manhattan parade  in addition to these scores of features were released with technicolor sequences as well as numerous technicolor specials short subjects the majority of these color films were musicals in  warner bros bought the st louisbased theater chain skouras brothers following this takeover spyros skouras the driving force of the chain became general manager of the warner brothers theater circuit in america he worked successfully in that post for two years and turned its losses into profits harry produced an adaptation of a cole porter musical titled fifty million frenchmen through first national the studios profit increased substantially after the success of the studios  first national film noahs ark harry agreed to make michael curtiz a major director at the burbank studio mort blumenstock a first national screenwriter became a top writer at the brothers new york headquarters in the third quarter warner bros gained complete control of first national when harry purchased the companys remaining onethird share from fox the justice department agreed to allow the purchase if first national was maintained as a separate company when the great depression hit warner asked for and got permission to merge the two studios soon afterward warner bros moved to the first national lot in burbank though the companies merged the justice department required warner to release a few films each year under the first national name until  for thirty years certain warner productions were identified mainly for tax purposes as a warner bros–first national picture in the latter part of  jack warner hired george arliss to star in disraeli which was a success arliss won an academy award for best actor and went on to star in nine more movies for the studio in  harry acquired more theaters in atlantic city despite the beginning of the great depression in july  the studios banker motley flint was murdered by a disgruntled investor in another company harry acquired a string of music publishers to form warner bros music in april  warner bros acquired brunswick records harry obtained radio companies foreign sound patents and a lithograph company after establishing warner bros music harry appointed his son lewis to manage the company by  the studio began to feel the effects of the depression as the public could no longer afford the tickets the studio reportedly lost  million and an additional  million the following year in  warner bros music head lewis warner died from an infected wisdom tooth around that time zanuck hired screenwriter wilson mizner while at the studio mizner had hardly any respect for authority and found it difficult to work with jack but became an asset as time went by warner became more tolerant of mizner and helped invest in mizners brown derby restaurant on april   mizner died from a heart attack by  audiences had grown tired of musicals and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies the public had begun to associate musicals with color and thus studios began to abandon its use warner bros had a contract with technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process as a result the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio doctor x  and mystery of the wax museum  in the latter part of  harry warner rented the teddington studios in london england the studio focused on making quota quickies for the domestic british market and irving asher was appointed as the studios head producer in  harry officially purchased the teddington studios in february  warner bros produced nd street a very successful musical under the direction of lloyd bacon warner assigned bacon to more expensive productions including footlight parade wonder bar broadway gondolier which he also starred in and gold diggers that saved the company from bankruptcy in the wake of nd streets success the studio produced profitable musicals these starred ruby keeler and dick powell and were mostly directed by busby berkeley in  the revival suffered a major blow when berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk by the end of the year people again tired of warner bros musicals and the studio—after the huge profits made by  film captain blood—shifted its focus to errol flynn swashbucklers – precode realistic period with the collapse of the market for musicals warner bros under zanuck turned to more socially realistic storylines for its many films about gangsters warner bros soon became known as a gangster studio the studios first gangster film little caesar was a great box office success and edward g robinson starred in many of the subsequent warner gangster films the studios next effort the public enemy made james cagney arguably the studios new top star and warner bros made more gangster films james cagney and joan blondell in footlight parade  another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed i am a fugitive from a chain gang based on a true story and starring paul muni joining cagney and robinson as one the studios top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film which convinced audiences to question the american legal system by january  the films protagonist robert elliot burns—still imprisoned in new jersey—and other chain gang prisoners nationwide appealed and were released in january  georgia chain gang warden j harold hardy—who was also made into a character in the film—sued the studio for displaying vicious untrue and false attacks against him in the film after appearing in the warners film the man who played god bette davis became a top star in  relief for the studio came after franklin d roosevelt became president and began the new deal this economic rebound allowed warner bros to again become profitable the same year zanuck quit harry warners relationship with zanuck had become strained after harry strongly opposed allowing zanucks film baby face to step outside hays code boundaries the studio reduced his salary as a result of losses from the great depression and harry refused to restore it as the company recovered zanuck established his own company harry thereafter raised salaries for studio employees in  warner was able to link up with newspaper tycoon william randolph hearsts cosmopolitan films hearst had previously worked with mgm but ended the association after a dispute with head producer irving thalberg over the treatment of hearsts longstanding mistress actress marion davies who was struggling for box office success through his partnership with hearst warner signed davies to a studio contract hearsts company and davies films however did not increase the studios profits in  the studio lost over  million of which  was the result of a  fire at the burbank studio destroying  years worth of early vitagraph warner bros and first national films the following year hearsts film adaption of william shakespeares a midsummer nights dream  failed at the box office and the studios net loss increased during this time harry and six other movie studio figures were indicted for conspiracy to violate the sherman antitrust act through an attempt to gain a monopoly over st louis movie theaters in  harry was put on trial after a mistrial harry sold the companys movie theaters and the case was never reopened  also saw the studio make a net profit of  the studio as seen in the trailer for the petrified forest  by  contracts of musical and silent stars were not renewed replaced by toughtalking workingclass types who better fit these pictures dorothy mackaill dolores del río bebe daniels frank fay winnie lightner bernice claire alexander gray alice white and jack mulhall that had characterized the urban modern and sophisticated attitude of the s gave way to james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson warren william and barbara stanwyck who would be more acceptable to the common man the studio was one of the most prolific producers of precode pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency around  as a result warner bros turned to historical pictures from around  to avoid confrontations with the breen office in  following the success of the petrified forest jack signed humphrey bogart to a studio contract warner however did not think bogart was star material and cast bogart in infrequent roles as a villain opposite either james cagney or edward robinson over the next five years after hal b wallis succeeded zanuck in  and the hays code began to be enforced in  the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic idealized pictures the studios historical dramas melodramas or womens pictures swashbucklers and adaptations of bestsellers with stars like bette davis olivia de havilland paul muni and errol flynn avoided the censors in  bette davis by now arguably the studios top star was unhappy with her roles she traveled to england and tried to break her contract davis lost the lawsuit and returned to america although many of the studios employees had problems with jack warner they considered albert and harry fair code era in the s many actors and actresses disappeared who had characterized the realistic precode era but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures warner bros remained a top studio in hollywood but this changed after  as other studios notably mgm quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized warner bros however in the late s bette davis became the studios top draw and was even dubbed as the fifth warner brother humphrey bogart in the petrified forest  in  cagney sued jack warner for breach of contract cagney claimed warner had forced him to star in more films than his contract required cagney eventually dropped his lawsuit after a cash settlement nevertheless cagney left the studio to establish an independent film company with his brother bill the cagneys released their films though grand national films however they were not able to get good financing and ran out of money after their third film cagney then agreed to return to warner bros after jack agreed to a contract guaranteeing cagney would be treated to his own terms after the success of yankee doodle dandy at the box office cagney again questioned if the studio would meet his salary demand and again quit to form his own film production and distribution company with bill another employee with whom warner had troubles was studio producer bryan foy in  wallis hired foy as a producer for the studios low budget bfilms leading to his nickname the keeper of the bs foy was able to garnish arguably more profits than any other bfilm producer at the time during foys time at the studio however warner fired him seven different times during  the story of louis pasteur proved a box office success and star paul muni won the oscar for best actor in march  the studios  film the life of emile zola gave the studio its first best picture oscar in  the studio hired midwestern radio announcer ronald reagan although reagan was initially a bfilm actor warner bros was impressed by his performance in the final scene of knute rockne all american and agreed to pair him with flynn in santa fe trail  reagan then returned to bfilms after his performance in the studios  kings row warner decided to make reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract tripling his salary in  harrys daughter doris read a copy of margaret mitchells gone with the wind and was interested in making a film adaptation doris offered mitchell  for screen rights jack vetoed the deal realizing it would be an expensive production major paramount star george raft also eventually proved to be a problem for jack warner had signed him in  finally bringing the third top s gangster actor into the warners fold knowing that he could carry any gangster picture when either robinson or cagney were on suspension raft had difficulty working with bogart and refused to costar with him eventually warner agreed to release raft from his contract in  after raft had turned the role down the studio gave bogart the role of mad dog roy earle in the  film high sierra which helped establish him as a top star following high sierra and after raft had once again turned the part down bogart was given the leading role in john hustons successful  remake of the studios  precode film the maltese falcon based upon the dashiell hammett novel warners cartoons main articles warner bros cartoons and warner bros animation warners cartoon unit had its roots in the independent harman and ising studio from  to  disney alumni hugh harman and rudolf ising produced musical cartoons for leon schlesinger who sold them to warner harman and ising introduced their character bosko in the first looney tunes cartoon sinkin in the bathtub and created a sister series merrie melodies in  harman and ising broke away from schlesinger in  due to a contractual dispute taking bosko with them to mgm as a result schlesinger started his own studio leon schlesinger productions which continued with merrie melodies while starting production on looney tunes starring buddy a bosko clone by the end of world war  a new schlesinger production team including directors friz freleng started in  tex avery started in  frank tashlin started in  bob clampett started in  chuck jones started in  and bob mckimson started in  was formed schlesingers staff developed a fastpaced irreverent style that made their cartoons globally popular in  avery directed cartoons starring porky pig which established the character as the studios first animated star in addition to porky warner bros cartoon characters daffy duck who debuted in the  short porkys duck hunt elmer fudd who debuted in the  short elmers candid camera bugs bunny who debuted in the  short a wild hare and tweety who debuted in the  short a tale of two kitties achieved star power by  the schlesinger studio had surpassed walt disney studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts warner bros eventually bought schlesingers cartoon unit in  and renamed it warner bros cartoons unfortunately the unit was indifferently treated by senior management beginning with the installation of edward selzer as senior producer whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent jack had little regard for the companys short film product and reputedly was so ignorant about the animation division of the studio that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of mickey mouse walt disney productions flagship character he sold off the units preaugust  library for  each which proved a shortsighted transaction in light of its eventual value warner bros cartoons continued with intermittent interruptions until  when it was dissolved as the parent company ceased film shorts entirely characters such as bugs bunny daffy duck tweety bird sylvester and porky pig became central to the companys image in subsequent decades bugs in particular remains a mascot to warner bros its various divisions and six flags which time warner once owned the success of the compilation film the bugs bunnyroad runner movie in  featuring the archived film of these characters prompted warner brothers to organize warner bros animation as a new production division to restart production of original material world war ii according to warners autobiography prior to us entry in world war ii philip kauffman warner bros german sales head was murdered by the nazis in berlin in  harry produced the successful antigerman film the life of emile zola  after that harry supervised the production of more antigerman films including confessions of a nazi spy  the sea hawk  which made king phillip ii an equivalent of hitler sergeant york and youre in the army now  harry then decided to focus on producing war films warners cut its film production in half during the war eliminating its b pictures unit in  bryan foy joined twentieth century fox bette davis in now voyager  during the war era the studio made casablanca now voyager yankee doodle dandy all  this is the army and mission to moscow both  the latter became controversial a few years afterwards at the premieres of yankee doodle dandy in los angeles new york and london audiences purchased  million in war bonds for the governments of england and the united states by the middle of  however audiences had tired of war films but warner continued to produce them losing money in honor of the studios contributions to the cause the navy named a liberty ship after the brothers father benjamin warner harry christened the ship by the time the war ended  million in war bonds were purchased through the studio the red cross collected  pints of plasma from studio employees and  of the studios employees served in the armed forces including harry warners soninlaw milton sperling and jacks son jack warner jr following a dispute over ownership of casablancas oscar for best picture wallis resigned after casablanca made bogart a top star bogarts relationship with jack deteriorated in  olivia de havilland whom warner was loaning to different studios sued warner for breach of contract de haviland had refused to portray famed abolitionist elizabeth blackwell in an upcoming film for columbia pictures warner responded by sending  telegrams to different film production companies warning them not to hire her for any role afterwards de haviland discovered employment contracts in the united states could only last seven years de haviland had been under contract with the studio since  the court ruled in de havilands favor and she left the studio through de havilands victory many of the studios longtime actors were now freed from their contracts and harry decided to terminate the studios suspension policy the same year jack signed newly released mgm actress joan crawford a former top star who found her career fading crawfords first role with the studio was s hollywood canteen her first starring role at the studio in the title role as mildred pierce  revived her career and earned her an oscar for best actress after world war ii changing hands in the postwar years warner bros continued to create new stars including lauren bacall and doris day the studio prospered greatly after the war by  company payroll reached  a week and net profit topped  million jack warner continued to refuse to meet screen actors guild salary demands in september  employees engaged in a monthlong strike in retaliation warner—during his  testimony before congress about mission to moscow—accused multiple employees of ties to communists by the end of  the studio reached a record net profit of  million on january   warner offered the first color newsreel covering the tournament of roses parade and the rose bowl game in  bette davis still their top actress and now hostile to jack was a big problem for harry after she and others left the studio after completing the film beyond the forest warner was a party to the united states v paramount pictures inc antitrust case of the s this action brought by the justice department and the federal trade commission claimed the five integrated studiotheater chain combinations restrained competition the supreme court heard the case in  and ruled for the government as a result warner and four other major studios were forced to separate production from exhibition in  the studios net profit was only  million warner bros had two semiindependent production companies that released films through the studiocitation needed one of these was sperlings united states pictures vivien leigh as blanche dubois in a streetcar named desire  in the early s the threat of television emerged in  jack decided to copy united artists successful d film bwana devil releasing his own d films beginning with house of wax however d films soon lost their appeal among moviegoers d almost caused the demise of the warner bros cartoon studio having completed a d bugs bunny cartoon lumber jackrabbit jack warner ordered the animation unit to be shut down erroneously believing that all cartoons hence would be produced in the d process several months later warner relented and reopened the cartoon studio fortunately warner bros had enough of a backlog of cartoons and a healthy reissue program so that there was no noticeable interruption in the release schedule in  warner bros made their first film carson city in warnercolor the studios name for eastmancolor after the downfall of d films harry warner decided to use cinemascope in future warner bros films one of the studios first cinemascope films the high and the mighty owned by john waynes company batjac enabled the studio to show a profit early in  warners theater holdings were spun off as stanley warner theaters stanley warners nontheater holdings were sold to simon fabian enterprises and its theaters merged with rko theatres to become rkostanley warner theatres by  the studio was losing money declining from s net profit of  million and the next two years of between  and  million on february   jack warner sold the rights to all of his pre films to associated artists productions which merged with united artists television in  and was subsequently acquired by turner broadcasting system in early  as part of a failed takeover of mgmua by ted turner in may  the brothers announced they were putting warner bros on the market jack secretly organized a syndicate—headed by boston banker serge semenenko– to purchase  of the stock after the three brothers sold jack—through his underthetable deal—joined semenenkos syndicate and bought back all his stock shortly after the deal was completed in july jack—now the companys largest stockholder—appointed himself its new president shortly after the deal closed jack announced the company and its subsidiaries would be directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties talents and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible warner bros television and warner bros records by  with the success of television threatening the film industry more and more harry warner decided to emphasize television production however the federal communications commission fcc would not permit it after an unsuccessful attempt to convince other movie studio bosses to switch harry abandoned his television efforts jack had problems with milton berles unsuccessful film always leave them laughing during the peak of berles television popularity warner felt that berle was not strong enough to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free however jack was pressured into using berle replacing danny kaye with him berles outrageous behavior on the set and the films massive failure led to jack banning television sets from film sets james garner and jack kelly in maverick  on march   the studio was finally able to engage in television through the successful warner bros television unit run by william t orr jack warners soninlaw warner bros television provided abc with a weekly show warner bros presents the show featured rotating shows based on three film successes kings row casablanca and cheyenne followed by a promotion for a new film it was not a success the studios next effort was to make a weekly series out of cheyenne cheyenne was televisions first hourlong western two episodes were placed together for feature film release outside the united states in the tradition of their b pictures the studio followed up with a series of rapidly produced popular westerns such as writerproducer roy huggins critically lauded maverick as well as sugarfoot bronco lawman the alaskans and colt  the success of these series helped to make up for losses in the film business as a result jack decided to emphasize television production warners produced a series of popular private detective shows beginning with  sunset strip – followed by hawaiian eye – bourbon street beat  and surfside six – within a few years the studio provoked hostility among their tv stars such as clint walker and james garner who sued over a contract dispute and won edd byrnes was not so lucky and bought himself out of his contract jack was angered by their perceived ingratitude who evidently showed more independence than film actors deepening his contempt for the new medium many of warners television stars appeared in the casts of warners cinema releases in  a court decision forced warners to end contracts with their television stars engaging them for specific series or film rolescitation needed in  jack webb was the head of warners tv division  dean martin and frank sinatra warner bros was already the owner of extensive musicpublishing holdings whose tunes had appeared in countless cartoons arranged by carl stalling and television shows arranged by max steiner in  the studio launched warner bros records initially the label released recordings made by their television stars—whether they could sing or not—and records based on television soundtracks in  warner agreed to a rescue takeover of frank sinatras reprise records the deal gave sinatra us million and part ownership of warner bros records making reprise a sublabel most significantly the deal brought reprise manager morris mo ostin into the company in  upon seeing the profits record companies made from warner film music warner decided to claim ownership of the studios film soundtracks in its first eighteen months warner bros records lost around  million new owners warner bros rebounded in the late s specializing in adaptations of popular plays like the bad seed  no time for sergeants  and gypsy  while he slowly recovered from a car crash that occurred while vacationing in france in  jack returned to the studio and made sure his name was featured in studio press releases from  the studios annual net profit was a little over  million warner paid an unprecedented  million for the film rights to the broadway musical my fair lady in february  the previous owner cbs director william s paley set terms including half the distributors gross profits plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract in  the studios net profit dropped to  million by the mids motion picture production was in decline as the industry was in the midst of a painful transition from the golden age of hollywood to the era now known as new hollywood few studio films were made in favor of coproductions for which warner provided facilities money and distribution and pickups of independent pictures with the success of the studios  film of broadway play my fair lady as well as its soundtrack warner bros records became a profitable subsidiary the  film whos afraid of virginia woolf was a huge success in november  jack gave in to advancing age and changing times selling control of the studio and music business to seven arts productions run by canadian investors elliot and kenneth hyman for  million the company including the studio was renamed warner brosseven arts warner remained president until the summer of  when camelot failed at the box office and warner gave up his position to his longtime publicity director ben kalmenson warner remained on board as an independent producer and vicepresident with the  success of bonnie and clyde warner bros was again profitable two years later the hymans were tired and fed up with jack warner and his actions they accepted a cashandstock offer from kinney national company for more than  million kinney owned a hollywood talent agency ashleyfamous whose founder ted ashley led kinney head steve ross to purchase warner bros ashley became the studio head and changed the name to warner bros inc once again jack warner was outraged by the hymans sale and decided to retire until his death from serious health complications of heart inflammation in august  although movie audiences had shrunk warners new management believed in the drawing power of stars signing coproduction deals with several of the biggest names of the day including paul newman robert redford barbra streisand and clint eastwood carrying the studio successfully through the s and s warner bros also made major profits on films and television shows built around the characters of superman batman and wonder woman owned by warner bros subsidiary dc comics abandoning parking lots and funeral homes the refocused kinney renamed itself in honor of its bestknown holding warner communications throughout the s and s warner communications branched out into other business such as video game company atari inc in  and later the six flags theme parks from  until the end of  warners international distribution operations were a joint venture with columbia pictures in some countries this joint venture distributed films from other companies such as emi films and cannon films in the uk warner ended the venture in  and partnered with walt disney pictures this joint venture lasted until  when disney created buena vista international in  in a costcutting move warner and columbia formed a third company called the burbank studios tbs they would share the warner lot in burbank both studios technically became production entities giving tbs daytoday responsibility for studio grounds and upkeep the columbia ranch about a mile north of warners lot was part of the deal the warnercolumbia relationship was acrimonious but the reluctance of both studios to approve or spend money on capital upgrades that might only help the other did have the unintended consequence of preserving the warner lots primary function as a filmmaking facility while it produced relatively little during the s and s most films produced after  were filmed on location after the failure of camelot was partially attributed to the fact it was set in england but obviously filmed in burbank with control over its own lot tied up in tbs warner ultimately retained a significant portion of its backlot while fox sold its backlot to create century city universal turned part of its backlot into a theme park and shopping center and disney replaced its backlot with office buildings and exiled its animation department to an industrial park in glendale in  a solution to the situation became evident when warner bros acquired lorimartelepictures and gained control of the former mgm studio lot in culver city and that same year sony bought columbia pictures sony was flush with cash and warner bros now had two studio lots in  tbs ended when sony bought the mgm lot from warner and moved columbia to culver city however warner kept the columbia ranch now known as the warner bros ranch warner communications merged in  with

wonskolaser or wonsal before anglicization harry albert sam and jack warner they emigrated as young children with their parents to canada from krasnosielc which was located in the part of congress poland that had been subjugated to the russian empire following the eighteenthcentury partitions of poland near presentday ostrołęka jack the youngest was born in london ontario the three elder brothers began in the movie theater business having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of pennsylvania and ohio in the beginning sam and albert warner invested  to present life of an american fireman and the great train robbery they opened their first theater the cascade in new castle pennsylvania in  when the original building was in danger of being demolished the modern warner bros called the current building owners and arranged to save it the owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance in  the warners founded the pittsburghbased duquesne amusement  supply company to distribute films in  harry warner hired an auditor named paul ashley chase by the time of world war i they had begun producing films in  they opened the first warner bros studio on sunset boulevard in hollywood sam and jack produced the pictures while harry and albert along with their auditor and now controller chase handled finance and distribution in new york city during world war i their first nationally syndicated film my four years in germany based on a popular book by former ambassador james w gerard was released on april   with help from money loaned to harry by his banker motley flint they formally incorporated as warner brothers pictures incorporated as late as the s warner bros claimed  as its founding date lobby card from open your eyes  lobby card from the beautiful and damned  the first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to avery hopwoods  broadway play the gold diggers from theatrical impresario david belasco however rin tin tin a dog brought from france after world war i by an american soldier established their reputation rin tin tin debuted in the feature where the north begins the movie was so successful that jack signed the dog to star in more films for  per week rin tin tin became the studios top star jack nicknamed him the mortgage lifter and the success boosted darryl f zanucks career zanuck eventually became a top producer and between  and  served as jacks righthand man and executive producer with responsibilities including daytoday film production more success came after ernst lubitsch was hired as head director harry rapf left the studio to join metrogoldwynmayer lubitschs film the marriage circle was the studios most successful film of  and was on the new york times best list for that year despite the success of rin tin tin and lubitsch warners remained a lesser studio sam and jack decided to offer broadway actor john barrymore the lead role in beau brummel the film was so successful that harry signed barrymore to a longterm contract like the marriage circle beau brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by the times by the end of  warner bros was arguably hollywoods most successful independent studio where it competed with the big three studios first national paramount pictures and mgm as a result harry warner—while speaking at a convention of  independent exhibitors in milwaukee wisconsin—was able to convince the filmmakers to spend  in newspaper advertising and harry saw this as an opportunity to establish theaters in cities such as new york and los angeles as the studio prospered it gained backing from wall street and in  goldman sachs arranged a major loan with this new money the warners bought the pioneer vitagraph company which had a nationwide distribution system in  warners also experimented in radio establishing a successful radio station kfwb in los angeles – sound color style warner bros was a pioneer of films with synchronized sound then known as talking pictures or talkies in  at sams urging warners agreed to add this feature to their productions by february  the studio reported a net loss of  don juan opens warners theatre after a long period denying sams request for sound harry agreed to change as long as the studios use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only the warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company western electric and established vitaphone in  vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks most notably in the feature don juan starring john barrymore the film was silent but it featured a large number of vitaphone shorts at the beginning to hype don juans release harry acquired the large piccadilly theater in manhattan new york city and renamed it warners theatre don juan premiered at the warners theatre in new york on august   throughout the early history of film distribution theater owners hired orchestras to attend film showings where they provided soundtracks through vitaphone warner bros produced eight shorts which aired at the beginning of every showing of don juan across the country in  many film production companies questioned the necessity don juan did not recoup its production cost and lubitsch left for mgm by april  the big five studios first national paramount mgm universal and producers distributing had ruined warners and western electric renewed warners vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound as a result of their financial problems warner bros took the next step and released the jazz singer starring al jolson this movie which has very little sound dialogue but includes sound segments of jolson singing was a sensation it signaled the beginning of the era of talking pictures and the twilight of the silent era however sam died the night before the opening preventing the brothers from attending the premiere jack became sole head of production sams death also had a great effect on jacks emotional state as sam was arguably jacks inspiration and favorite brother in the years to come jack kept the studio under tight control firing employees was common among those whom jack fired were rin tin tin in  and douglas fairbanks jr—who had served as first nationals top star since the brothers acquired the studio in —in  thanks to the success of the jazz singer the studio was cashrich jolsons next film for the company the singing fool was also a success with the success of these first talkies the jazz singer lights of new york the singing fool and the terror warner bros became a top studio and the brothers were now able to move out from the poverty row section of hollywood los angeles and acquire a much larger studio lot in burbank they expanded by acquiring the stanley corporation a major theater chain this gave them a share in rival first national pictures of which stanley owned onethird in a bidding war with william fox warner bros bought more first national shares on september   jack also appointed zanuck as the manager of first national pictures warner bros–first national studios

asked for and got permission to merge the two studios soon afterward warner bros moved to the first national lot in burbank though the companies merged the justice department required warner to release a few films each year under the first national name until  for thirty years certain warner productions were identified mainly for tax purposes as a warner bros–first national picture in the

brown derby restaurant on april   mizner died from a heart attack by  audiences had grown tired of musicals and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies the public had begun to associate musicals with color and thus studios began to abandon its use warner bros had a contract with technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process as a result the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio doctor x  and mystery of the wax museum  in the latter part of  harry warner rented the teddington studios in london england the studio focused on making quota quickies for the domestic british market and irving asher was appointed as the studios head producer in  harry officially purchased the teddington studios in february  warner bros produced nd street a very successful musical under the direction of lloyd bacon warner assigned bacon to more expensive productions including footlight parade wonder bar broadway gondolier which he also starred in and gold diggers that saved the company from bankruptcy in the wake of nd streets success the studio produced profitable musicals these starred ruby keeler and dick powell and were mostly directed by busby berkeley in  the revival suffered a major blow when berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk by the end of the year people again tired of warner bros musicals and the studio—after the huge profits made by  film captain blood—shifted its focus to errol flynn swashbucklers – precode realistic period with the collapse of the market for musicals warner bros under zanuck turned to more socially realistic storylines for its many films about gangsters warner bros soon became known as a gangster studio the studios first gangster film little caesar was a great box office success and edward g robinson starred in many of the subsequent warner gangster films the studios next effort the public enemy made james cagney arguably the studios new top star and warner bros made more gangster films james cagney and joan blondell in footlight parade  another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed i am a fugitive from a chain gang based on a true story and starring paul muni joining cagney and robinson as one the studios top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film which convinced audiences to question the american legal system by january  the films protagonist robert elliot burns—still imprisoned in new jersey—and other chain gang prisoners nationwide appealed and were released in january  georgia chain gang warden j harold hardy—who was also made into a character in the film—sued the studio for displaying vicious untrue and false attacks against him in the film after appearing in the warners film the man who played god bette davis became a top star in  relief for the studio came after franklin d roosevelt became president and began the new deal this economic rebound allowed warner bros to again become profitable the same year zanuck quit harry warners relationship with zanuck had become strained after harry strongly opposed allowing zanucks film baby face to step outside hays code boundaries the studio reduced his salary as a result of losses from the great depression and harry refused to restore it as the company recovered zanuck established his own company harry thereafter raised salaries for studio employees in  warner was able to link up with newspaper tycoon william randolph hearsts cosmopolitan films hearst had previously worked with mgm but ended the association after a dispute with head producer irving thalberg over the treatment of hearsts longstanding mistress actress marion davies who was struggling for box office success through his partnership with hearst warner signed davies to a studio contract hearsts company and davies films however did not increase the studios profits in  the studio lost over  million of which  was the result of a  fire at the burbank studio destroying  years worth of early vitagraph warner bros and first national films the following year hearsts film adaption of william shakespeares a midsummer nights dream  failed at the box office and the studios net loss increased during this time harry and six other movie studio figures were indicted for conspiracy to violate the sherman antitrust act

better fit these pictures dorothy mackaill dolores del río bebe daniels frank fay winnie lightner bernice claire alexander gray alice white and jack mulhall that had characterized the urban modern and sophisticated attitude of the s gave way to james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson warren william and barbara stanwyck who would be more acceptable to the common man the studio was one of the most prolific producers of precode pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency around  as a result warner bros turned to historical pictures from around  to avoid confrontations with the breen office in  following the success of the petrified forest jack signed humphrey bogart to a studio contract warner however did not think bogart was star material and cast bogart in infrequent roles as a villain opposite either james cagney or edward robinson over the next five years after hal b wallis succeeded zanuck in  and the hays code began to be enforced in  the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic idealized pictures the studios historical dramas melodramas or womens pictures swashbucklers and adaptations of bestsellers with stars like bette davis olivia de havilland paul muni and errol flynn avoided the censors in  bette davis by now arguably the studios top star was unhappy with her roles she traveled to england and tried to break her contract davis lost the lawsuit and returned to america although many of the studios employees had problems with jack warner they considered albert and harry fair code era in the s many actors and actresses disappeared who had characterized the realistic precode era but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures warner bros remained a top studio in hollywood but this changed after  as other studios notably mgm quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized warner bros however in the late s bette davis became the studios top draw and was even dubbed as the fifth warner brother humphrey bogart in the petrified forest  in  cagney sued jack warner for breach of contract cagney claimed warner had forced him to star in more films than his contract required cagney eventually dropped his lawsuit after a cash settlement nevertheless cagney left the studio to establish an independent film company with his brother bill the cagneys released their films though grand national films however they were not able to get good financing and ran out of money after their third film cagney then agreed to return to warner bros after jack agreed to a contract guaranteeing cagney would be treated to his own terms after the success of yankee doodle dandy at the box office cagney again questioned if the studio would meet his salary demand and again quit to form his own film production and distribution company with bill another employee with whom warner had troubles was studio producer bryan foy in  wallis hired foy as a producer for the studios low budget bfilms leading to his nickname the keeper of the bs foy was able to garnish arguably more profits than any other bfilm producer at the time during foys time at the studio however warner fired him seven different times during  the story of louis pasteur proved a box office success and star paul muni won the oscar for best actor in march  the studios  film the life of emile zola gave the studio its first best picture oscar in  the studio hired midwestern radio announcer ronald reagan although reagan was initially a bfilm actor warner bros was impressed by his performance in the final scene of knute rockne all american and agreed to pair him with flynn in santa fe trail  reagan then returned to bfilms after his performance in the studios  kings row warner decided to make reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract tripling his salary in  harrys daughter doris read a copy of margaret mitchells gone with the wind and was interested in making a film adaptation doris offered mitchell  for screen rights jack vetoed the deal realizing it would be an expensive production major paramount star george raft also eventually proved to be a problem for jack warner had signed him in  finally bringing the third top s gangster actor into the warners fold knowing that he could carry any gangster picture when either robinson or cagney were on suspension raft had difficulty working with bogart and refused to costar with him eventually warner agreed to release raft from his contract in  after raft had turned the role down the studio gave bogart the role of mad dog roy earle in the  film high sierra which helped establish him as a top star following high sierra and after raft had once again turned the part down bogart was given the leading role in john hustons successful  remake of the studios  precode film the maltese falcon based upon the dashiell hammett novel warners cartoons main articles warner bros cartoons and warner bros animation warners cartoon unit had its roots in the independent harman and ising studio from  to  disney alumni hugh harman and rudolf ising produced musical cartoons for leon schlesinger who sold them to warner harman and ising introduced their character bosko in the first looney tunes cartoon sinkin in the bathtub and created a sister series merrie melodies in  harman and ising broke away from schlesinger in  due to a contractual dispute taking bosko with them to mgm as a result schlesinger started his own studio leon schlesinger productions which continued with merrie melodies while starting production on looney tunes starring buddy a bosko clone by the end of world war  a new schlesinger production team including directors friz freleng started in  tex avery started in  frank tashlin started in  bob clampett started in  chuck jones started in  and bob mckimson started in  was formed schlesingers staff

wild hare and tweety who debuted in the  short a tale of two kitties achieved star power by  the schlesinger studio had surpassed walt disney studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts warner bros eventually bought schlesingers cartoon unit in  and renamed it warner bros cartoons unfortunately the unit was indifferently treated by senior management beginning with the installation of edward selzer as senior producer whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent jack had little regard for the companys short film product and reputedly was so ignorant about the animation division of the studio that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of mickey mouse walt disney productions flagship character he sold off the units preaugust  library for  each which proved a shortsighted transaction in light of its eventual value warner bros cartoons continued with intermittent interruptions until  when it was dissolved as the parent company ceased film shorts entirely characters such as bugs bunny daffy duck tweety bird sylvester and porky pig became central to the companys image in subsequent decades bugs in particular remains a mascot to warner bros its various divisions and six flags which time warner once owned the success of the compilation film the bugs bunnyroad runner movie in  featuring the archived film of these characters

famed abolitionist elizabeth blackwell in an upcoming film for columbia pictures warner responded by sending  telegrams to different film production companies warning them not to hire her for any role afterwards de haviland discovered employment contracts in the united states could only last seven years de haviland had been under contract with the studio since  the court ruled in de havilands favor and she left the studio through de havilands victory many of the studios longtime actors were now freed from their contracts and harry decided to terminate the studios suspension policy the same year

production however the federal communications commission fcc would not permit it after an unsuccessful attempt to convince other movie studio bosses to switch harry abandoned his television efforts jack had problems with milton berles unsuccessful film always leave them laughing during the peak of berles television popularity warner felt that berle was not strong enough to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free however jack was pressured into using berle replacing danny kaye with him berles outrageous behavior on the set and the films massive failure led to jack banning television sets from film sets james garner and jack kelly in maverick  on march   the studio was finally able to engage in television through the successful warner bros television unit run by william t orr jack warners soninlaw warner bros television provided abc with a weekly show warner bros presents the show featured rotating shows based on three film

first hourlong western two episodes were placed together for feature film release outside the united states in the tradition of their b pictures the studio followed up with a series of rapidly produced popular westerns such as writerproducer roy huggins critically lauded maverick as well as sugarfoot bronco lawman the alaskans and colt  the success of these series helped to make up for losses in the film business as a result jack decided to emphasize television production warners produced a series of popular private detective shows beginning with  sunset strip – followed by hawaiian eye – bourbon street beat  and surfside six – within a few years the studio provoked hostility among their tv stars such as clint walker and james garner who sued over a contract dispute and won edd byrnes was not so lucky and bought himself out of his contract jack was angered by their perceived ingratitude who evidently showed more independence than film actors deepening his contempt for the new medium many of warners television stars appeared in the casts of warners cinema releases in  a court decision forced warners to end contracts with their television stars engaging them for specific series or film rolescitation needed in  jack webb was the head of warners tv division  dean martin and frank sinatra warner bros was already the owner of extensive musicpublishing holdings whose tunes

the golden age of hollywood to the era now known as new hollywood few studio films were made in favor of coproductions for which warner provided facilities money and distribution and pickups of independent pictures with the success of the studios  film of broadway play my fair lady as well as its soundtrack warner bros records became a profitable subsidiary the  film whos afraid of virginia woolf was a huge success in november  jack gave in to advancing age and changing times selling control of the studio and music business to seven arts productions run by canadian investors elliot and kenneth hyman for  million the company including the studio was renamed warner brosseven arts warner remained president until the summer of  when camelot failed at the box office and warner gave up his position to his longtime publicity director ben kalmenson warner remained on board as an independent producer and vicepresident with the  success of bonnie and clyde warner bros was again

hollywood talent agency ashleyfamous whose founder ted ashley led kinney head steve ross to purchase warner bros ashley became the studio head and changed the name to warner bros inc once again jack warner was outraged by the hymans sale and decided to retire until his death from serious health complications of heart inflammation in august  although movie audiences had shrunk warners new management believed in the drawing power of stars signing coproduction deals with several of the biggest names of the day including paul newman robert redford barbra streisand and clint eastwood

communications branched out into other business such as video game company atari inc in  and later the six flags theme parks from  until the end of  warners international distribution operations were a joint venture with columbia pictures in some countries this joint venture distributed films from other companies such as emi films and cannon films in the uk warner ended the venture in  and partnered with walt disney pictures this joint venture lasted until  when disney created buena vista international in  in a costcutting move warner and columbia formed a third company called the burbank studios tbs they would share the warner lot in burbank both studios technically became production entities giving tbs daytoday responsibility for studio grounds and upkeep the columbia ranch about a mile north of warners lot was part of the deal the warnercolumbia relationship was acrimonious but the reluctance of both studios to approve or spend money on capital upgrades that might only help the other did have the unintended consequence of preserving the warner lots primary function as a filmmaking facility while it produced relatively little during the s and s most films produced after  were filmed on location after the failure of camelot was partially attributed to the fact it was set in england but obviously filmed in burbank with control over its own lot tied up in tbs warner ultimately retained a significant portion of its backlot while fox sold its backlot to create century city universal turned part of its backlot into a theme park and shopping center and disney replaced its backlot with office buildings and exiled its animation department to an industrial park in glendale in  a solution to the situation became evident when warner bros acquired lorimartelepictures and gained control of the former mgm studio lot in culver city and that same year sony bought columbia pictures sony was flush with cash and warner bros now had two studio lots in  tbs ended when sony bought the mgm lot from warner and moved columbia to culver city however warner kept the columbia ranch now known as the warner bros ranch warner communications merged in  with

the north begins the movie was so successful that jack signed the dog to star in more films for  per week rin tin tin became the studios top star jack nicknamed him the mortgage lifter and the success boosted darryl f zanucks career zanuck eventually became a top producer and between  and  served as jacks righthand man and executive producer with responsibilities including daytoday film production

role in beau brummel the film was so successful that harry signed barrymore to a longterm contract like the marriage circle beau brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by the times by the end of  warner bros was arguably hollywoods most successful independent studio where it competed with the big three studios first national paramount pictures and mgm as a result harry warner—while speaking at a convention of  independent exhibitors in milwaukee wisconsin—was able to convince the filmmakers to spend  in newspaper advertising and harry saw this as an opportunity to establish theaters in cities such as new york and los angeles as the studio prospered it gained backing from wall street and in  goldman sachs arranged a major loan with this new money the warners bought the pioneer vitagraph company which had a nationwide distribution system in  warners also experimented in radio establishing a successful radio station kfwb in los angeles – sound color style

hired orchestras to attend film showings where they provided soundtracks through vitaphone warner bros produced eight shorts which aired at the beginning of every showing of don juan across the country in  many film production companies questioned the necessity don juan did not recoup its production cost and lubitsch left for mgm by april  the big five studios first national paramount mgm universal and producers distributing had ruined warners and western electric renewed warners vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound as a result of their financial problems warner bros took the next step and released the jazz singer starring al jolson this movie which has very little sound dialogue but includes sound segments of jolson singing was a sensation it signaled the beginning of the era of talking pictures and the twilight of the silent era however sam died the night before the opening preventing the brothers from attending the premiere jack became sole head of production sams death also had a great effect on jacks emotional state as sam was arguably jacks inspiration and favorite brother in the years to come jack kept the studio under tight control firing employees was common among those whom jack fired were rin tin tin in  and douglas fairbanks jr—who had served as first nationals top star since the brothers acquired the studio in —in  thanks to the success of the jazz singer the studio was cashrich jolsons next film for the company the singing fool was also a success with the success of these first talkies the jazz

bidding war with william fox warner bros bought more first national shares on september   jack also appointed zanuck as the manager of first national pictures warner bros–first national studios burbank c  in  warner bros released lights of new york the first alltalking feature due to its success the movie industry converted entirely to sound almost overnight by the end of  all the major studios were exclusively making sound films in  first national pictures released their first film with warner bros noahs ark despite its expensive budget noahs ark was profitable in  warner bros released on with the show the first allcolor alltalking feature this was followed by gold diggers of broadway which was so popular it played in theatres until  the success of these two color pictures

purchased the companys remaining onethird share from fox the justice department agreed to allow the purchase if first national was maintained as a separate company when the great depression hit warner asked for and got permission to merge the two studios soon afterward warner bros moved to the first national lot in burbank though the companies merged the justice department required warner to release a few films each year under the first national name until  for thirty years certain warner productions were identified mainly for tax purposes as a warner bros–first national picture in the latter part of  jack warner hired george arliss to star in disraeli which was a success arliss won an academy award for best actor and went on to star in nine more movies for the studio in  harry acquired more theaters in atlantic city despite the beginning of the great depression in july  the studios banker motley flint was murdered by a disgruntled investor in another company harry acquired a string of music publishers to form warner bros music in april  warner bros acquired brunswick records harry obtained radio companies foreign sound patents and a lithograph company after establishing

lost  million and an additional  million the following year in  warner bros music head lewis warner died from an infected wisdom tooth around that time zanuck hired screenwriter wilson mizner while at the studio mizner had hardly any respect for authority and found it difficult to work with jack but became an asset as time went by warner became more tolerant of mizner and helped invest in mizners brown derby restaurant on april   mizner died from a heart attack by  audiences had grown tired of musicals and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies the public had begun to associate musicals with color and thus studios began to abandon its use warner bros had a contract with technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process as a result the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio doctor x  and mystery of the wax museum  in the latter part of  harry warner rented the teddington studios in london england the studio focused on making quota quickies for the domestic british market and irving asher was appointed as the studios head producer in  harry officially purchased the teddington studios in february  warner bros produced nd street a very successful musical under the direction of lloyd bacon warner assigned bacon to more expensive productions including footlight parade wonder bar broadway gondolier which he also starred in and gold diggers that saved the company from bankruptcy in the wake of nd streets success the studio produced profitable musicals these starred ruby keeler and dick powell and were mostly directed by busby berkeley in  the revival suffered a major blow when berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk by the end of the year people again tired of warner bros musicals and the studio—after the huge profits made by  film captain blood—shifted its focus to errol flynn swashbucklers – precode realistic period with the collapse of the market for musicals warner bros under zanuck turned to more socially realistic storylines for its many films about gangsters warner bros soon became known as a gangster studio the studios first gangster film little caesar was a great box office success and edward g robinson starred in many of the subsequent warner gangster films the studios next effort the public enemy made james cagney arguably the studios new top star and warner bros made more gangster films james cagney and joan blondell in footlight parade  another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed i am a fugitive from a chain gang based on a true story and starring paul muni joining cagney and robinson as one the studios top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film which convinced audiences to question the american legal system by january  the films protagonist robert elliot burns—still imprisoned in new jersey—and other chain gang prisoners nationwide appealed and were released in january  georgia chain gang warden j harold hardy—who was also made into a character in the film—sued the studio for displaying vicious untrue and false attacks against him in the film after appearing in the warners film the man who played god bette davis became a top star in  relief for the studio came after franklin d roosevelt became president and began the new deal this economic rebound allowed warner bros to again become profitable the same year zanuck quit harry warners relationship with zanuck had become strained after harry strongly opposed allowing zanucks film baby face to step outside hays code boundaries the studio reduced his salary as a result of losses from the great depression and harry refused to restore it as the company recovered zanuck established his own company harry thereafter raised salaries for studio employees in  warner was able to link up with newspaper tycoon william randolph hearsts cosmopolitan films hearst had previously worked with mgm but ended the association after a dispute with head producer irving thalberg over the treatment of hearsts longstanding mistress actress marion davies who was struggling for box office success through his partnership with hearst warner signed davies to a studio contract hearsts company and davies films however did not increase the studios profits in  the studio lost over  million of which  was the result of a  fire at the burbank studio destroying  years worth of early vitagraph warner bros and first national films the following year hearsts film adaption of william shakespeares a midsummer nights dream  failed at the box office and the studios net loss increased during this time harry and six other movie studio figures were indicted for conspiracy to violate the sherman antitrust act through an attempt to gain a monopoly over st louis movie theaters in  harry was put on trial after a mistrial harry sold the companys movie theaters and the case was never reopened  also saw the studio make a net profit of  the studio as seen in the trailer for the petrified forest  by  contracts of musical and silent stars were not renewed replaced by toughtalking workingclass types who better fit these pictures dorothy mackaill dolores del río bebe daniels frank fay winnie lightner bernice claire alexander gray alice white and jack mulhall that had characterized the urban modern and sophisticated attitude of the s gave way to james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson warren william and barbara stanwyck who would be more acceptable to the common man the studio was one of the most prolific producers of precode pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency around  as a result warner bros turned to historical pictures from around  to avoid confrontations with the breen office in  following the success of the petrified forest jack signed humphrey bogart to a studio contract warner however did not think bogart was star material and cast bogart in infrequent roles as a villain opposite either james cagney or edward robinson over the next five years after hal b wallis succeeded zanuck in  and the hays code began to be enforced in  the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic idealized pictures the studios historical dramas melodramas or womens pictures swashbucklers and adaptations of bestsellers with stars like bette davis olivia de havilland paul muni and errol flynn avoided the censors in  bette davis by now arguably the studios top star was unhappy with her roles she traveled to england and tried to break her contract davis lost the lawsuit and returned to america although many of the studios employees had problems with jack warner they considered albert and harry fair code era in the s many actors and actresses disappeared who had characterized the realistic precode era but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures warner bros remained a top studio in hollywood but this changed after  as other studios notably mgm quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized warner bros however in the late s bette davis became the studios top draw and was even dubbed as the fifth warner brother humphrey bogart in the petrified forest  in  cagney sued jack warner for breach of contract cagney claimed warner had forced him to star in more films than his contract required cagney eventually dropped his lawsuit after a cash settlement nevertheless cagney left the studio to establish an independent film company with his brother bill the cagneys released their films though grand national films however they were not able to get good financing and ran out of money after their third film cagney then agreed to return to warner bros after jack agreed to a contract guaranteeing cagney would be treated to his own terms after the success of yankee doodle dandy at the box office cagney again questioned if the studio would meet his salary demand and again quit to form his own film production and distribution company with bill another employee with whom warner had troubles was studio producer bryan foy in  wallis hired foy as a producer for the studios low budget bfilms leading to his nickname the keeper of the bs foy was able to garnish arguably more profits than any other bfilm producer at the time during foys time at the studio however warner fired him seven different times during  the story of louis pasteur proved a box office success and star paul muni won the oscar for best actor in march  the studios  film the life of emile zola gave the studio its first best picture oscar in  the studio hired midwestern radio announcer ronald reagan although reagan was initially a bfilm actor warner bros was impressed by his performance in the final scene of knute rockne all american and agreed to pair him with flynn in santa fe trail  reagan then returned to bfilms after his performance in the studios  kings row warner decided to make reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract tripling his salary in  harrys daughter doris read a copy of margaret mitchells gone with the wind and was interested in making a film adaptation doris offered mitchell  for screen rights jack vetoed the deal realizing it would be an expensive production major paramount star george raft also eventually proved to be a problem for jack warner had signed him in  finally bringing the third top s gangster actor into the warners fold knowing that he could carry any gangster picture when either robinson or cagney were on suspension raft had difficulty working with bogart and refused to costar with him eventually warner agreed to release raft from his contract in  after raft had turned the role down the studio gave bogart the role of mad dog roy earle in the  film high sierra which helped establish him as a top star following high sierra and after raft had once again turned the part down bogart was given the leading role in john hustons successful  remake of the studios  precode film the maltese falcon based upon the dashiell hammett novel warners cartoons main articles warner bros cartoons and warner bros animation warners cartoon unit had its roots in the independent harman and ising studio from  to  disney alumni hugh harman and rudolf ising produced musical cartoons for leon schlesinger who sold them to warner harman and ising introduced their character bosko in the first looney tunes cartoon sinkin in the bathtub and created a sister series merrie melodies in  harman and ising broke away from schlesinger in  due to a contractual dispute taking bosko with them to mgm as a result schlesinger started his own studio

wild hare and tweety who debuted in the  short a tale of two kitties achieved star power by  the schlesinger studio had surpassed walt disney studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts warner bros eventually bought schlesingers cartoon unit in  and renamed it warner bros cartoons unfortunately the unit was indifferently treated by senior management beginning with the installation of edward selzer as senior producer whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent jack had little regard for the companys short film product and reputedly was so ignorant about the animation division of the studio that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of mickey mouse walt disney productions flagship character he sold off the units preaugust  library for  each which proved a shortsighted transaction in light of its eventual value warner bros cartoons continued with intermittent interruptions until  when it was dissolved as the parent company ceased film shorts entirely characters such as bugs bunny daffy duck tweety bird sylvester and porky pig became central to the companys image in subsequent decades bugs in particular remains a mascot to warner bros its various divisions and six flags which time warner once owned the success of the compilation film the bugs bunnyroad runner movie in  featuring the archived film of these characters

famed abolitionist elizabeth blackwell in an upcoming film for columbia pictures warner responded by sending  telegrams to different film production companies warning them not to hire her for any role afterwards de haviland discovered employment contracts in the united states could only last seven years de haviland had been under contract with the studio since  the court ruled in de havilands favor and she left the studio through de havilands victory many of the studios longtime actors were now freed from their contracts and harry decided to terminate the studios suspension policy the same year

jack had problems with milton berles unsuccessful film always leave them laughing during the peak of berles television popularity warner felt that berle was not strong enough to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free however jack was pressured into using berle replacing danny kaye with him berles outrageous behavior on the set and the films massive failure led to jack banning television sets from film sets james garner and jack kelly in maverick  on march   the studio was finally able to engage in television through the successful warner

produced popular westerns such as writerproducer roy huggins critically lauded maverick as well as sugarfoot bronco lawman the alaskans and colt  the success of these series helped to make up for losses in the film business as a result jack decided to emphasize television production warners produced a series of popular private detective shows beginning with  sunset strip – followed by hawaiian eye – bourbon street beat  and surfside six – within a few years the studio provoked hostility among their tv stars such as clint walker and james garner who sued over a contract dispute and won edd byrnes was not so lucky and bought himself out of his contract jack was angered by their perceived ingratitude who evidently showed more independence than film actors deepening his contempt for the

a joint venture with columbia pictures in some countries this joint venture distributed films from other companies such as emi films and cannon films in the uk warner ended the venture in  and partnered with walt disney pictures this joint venture lasted until  when disney created buena vista international in  in a costcutting move warner and columbia formed a third company called the burbank studios tbs they would share the warner lot in burbank both studios technically became production entities giving tbs daytoday responsibility for studio grounds and upkeep the columbia ranch about a mile north of warners lot was part of the deal the warnercolumbia relationship was acrimonious but the reluctance of both studios to approve or spend money on capital upgrades that might only help the other did have the unintended consequence of preserving the warner lots primary function as a filmmaking facility while it produced relatively little during the s and s most films produced after  were filmed on location after the failure of camelot was partially attributed to the fact it was set in england but obviously filmed in burbank with control over its own lot tied up in tbs warner ultimately retained a significant portion of its backlot while fox sold its backlot to create century city universal turned part of its backlot into a theme park and shopping center and disney replaced its backlot with office buildings and exiled its animation department to an industrial park in glendale in  a solution to the situation became evident when warner bros acquired lorimartelepictures and gained control of the former mgm studio lot in culver city and that same year sony bought columbia pictures sony was flush with cash and warner bros now had two studio lots in  tbs ended when sony bought the mgm lot from warner and moved columbia to culver city however warner kept the columbia ranch now known as the warner bros ranch warner communications merged in  with

poland that had been subjugated to the russian empire following the eighteenthcentury partitions of poland near presentday ostrołęka jack the youngest was born in london ontario the three elder brothers began in the movie theater business having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of pennsylvania and ohio in the beginning sam and albert warner invested  to present life of an american fireman and the great train robbery they opened their first theater the cascade in new castle pennsylvania in  when the original building was in danger of being demolished the modern warner bros called the current building owners and arranged to save it the owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance in  the warners founded the pittsburghbased duquesne amusement  supply company to distribute films in  harry warner hired an auditor named paul ashley chase by the time of world war i they had begun producing films in  they opened the first warner bros studio on sunset boulevard in hollywood sam and jack produced the pictures while harry and albert along with their auditor and now controller chase handled finance and distribution in new york city during world war i their first nationally syndicated film my four years in germany based on a popular book by former ambassador james w gerard was released on april   with help from money loaned to harry by his banker motley flint they formally incorporated as warner brothers pictures incorporated as late as the s warner bros claimed  as its founding date lobby card from open your eyes  lobby card from the beautiful and damned  the first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to avery hopwoods  broadway play the gold diggers from theatrical impresario david belasco however rin tin tin a dog brought from france after world war i by an american soldier established their reputation rin tin tin debuted in the feature where the north begins the movie was so successful that jack signed the dog to star in more films for  per week rin tin tin became the studios top star jack nicknamed him the mortgage lifter and the success boosted darryl f zanucks career zanuck eventually became a top producer and between  and  served as jacks righthand man and executive producer with responsibilities including daytoday film production more success came after ernst lubitsch was hired as head director harry rapf left the studio to join metrogoldwynmayer lubitschs film the marriage circle was the studios most successful film of  and was on the new york times best list for that year despite the success of rin tin tin and lubitsch warners remained a lesser studio sam and jack decided to offer broadway actor john barrymore the lead role in beau brummel the film was so successful that harry signed barrymore to a longterm contract like the marriage circle beau brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by the times by the end of  warner bros was arguably hollywoods most successful independent studio where it competed with the big three studios first national paramount pictures and mgm as a result harry warner—while speaking at a convention of  independent exhibitors in milwaukee wisconsin—was able to convince the filmmakers to spend  in newspaper advertising and harry saw this as an opportunity to establish theaters in cities such as new york and los angeles as the studio prospered it gained backing from wall street and in  goldman sachs arranged a major loan with this new money the warners bought the pioneer vitagraph company which had a nationwide distribution system in  warners also experimented in radio establishing a successful radio station kfwb in los angeles – sound color style warner bros was a pioneer of films with synchronized sound then known as talking pictures or talkies in  at sams urging warners agreed to add this feature to their productions by february  the studio reported a net loss of  don juan opens warners theatre after a long period denying sams request for sound harry agreed to change as long as the studios use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only the warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company western electric and established vitaphone in  vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks most notably in the feature don juan starring john barrymore the film was silent but it featured a large number of vitaphone shorts at the beginning to hype don juans release harry acquired the large piccadilly theater in manhattan new york city and renamed it warners theatre don juan premiered at the warners theatre in new york on august   throughout the early history of film distribution theater owners hired orchestras to attend film showings where they provided soundtracks through vitaphone warner bros produced eight shorts which aired at the beginning of every showing of don juan across the country in  many film production companies questioned the necessity don juan did not recoup its production cost and lubitsch left for mgm by april  the big five studios first national paramount mgm universal and producers distributing had ruined warners and western electric renewed warners vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound as a result of their financial problems warner bros took the next step and released the jazz singer starring al jolson this movie which has very little sound dialogue but includes sound segments of jolson singing was a sensation it signaled the beginning of the era of talking pictures and the twilight of the silent era however sam died the night before the opening preventing the brothers from attending the premiere jack became sole head of production sams death also had a great effect on jacks emotional state as sam was arguably jacks inspiration and favorite brother in the years to come jack kept the studio under tight control firing employees was common among those whom jack fired were rin tin tin in  and douglas fairbanks jr—who had served as first nationals top star since the brothers acquired the studio in —in  thanks to the success of the jazz singer the studio was cashrich jolsons next film for the company the singing fool was also a success with the success of these first talkies the jazz singer lights of new york the singing fool and the terror warner bros became a top studio and the brothers were now able to move out from the poverty row section of hollywood los angeles and acquire a much larger studio lot in burbank they expanded by acquiring the stanley corporation a major theater chain this gave them a share in rival first national pictures of which stanley owned onethird in a bidding war with william fox warner bros bought more first national shares on september   jack also appointed zanuck as the manager of first national pictures warner bros–first national studios burbank c  in  warner bros released lights of new york the first alltalking feature due to its success the movie industry converted entirely to sound almost overnight by the end of  all the major studios were exclusively making sound films in  first national pictures released their first film with warner bros noahs ark despite its expensive budget noahs ark was profitable in  warner bros released on with the show the first allcolor alltalking feature this was followed by gold diggers of broadway which was so popular it played in theatres until  the success of these two color pictures caused a color revolution just as the first alltalkie had created one for talkies warner bros color films from  to  included the show of shows  sally  bright lights  golden dawn  hold everything  song of the flame  song of the west  the life of the party  sweet kitty bellairs  under a texas moon  bride of the regiment  viennese nights  woman hungry  kiss me again  fifty million frenchmen  and manhattan parade  in addition to these scores of features were released with technicolor sequences as well as numerous technicolor specials short subjects the majority of these color films were musicals in  warner bros bought the st louisbased theater chain skouras brothers following this takeover spyros skouras the driving force of the chain became general manager of the warner brothers theater circuit in america he worked successfully in that post for two years and turned its losses into profits harry produced an adaptation of a cole porter musical titled fifty million frenchmen through first national the studios profit increased substantially after the success of the studios  first national film noahs ark harry agreed to make michael curtiz a major director at the burbank studio mort blumenstock a first national screenwriter became a top writer at the brothers new york headquarters in the third quarter warner bros gained complete control of first national when harry purchased the companys remaining onethird share from fox the justice department agreed to allow the purchase if first national was maintained as a separate company when the great depression hit warner asked for and got permission to merge the two studios soon afterward warner bros moved to the first national lot in burbank though the companies merged the justice department required warner to release a few films each year under the first national name until  for thirty years certain warner productions were identified mainly for tax purposes as a warner bros–first national picture in the latter part of  jack warner hired george arliss to star in disraeli which was a success arliss won an academy award for best actor and went on to star in nine more movies for the studio in  harry acquired more theaters in atlantic city despite the beginning of the great depression in july  the studios banker motley flint was murdered by a disgruntled investor in another company harry acquired a string of music publishers to form warner bros music in april  warner bros acquired brunswick records harry obtained radio companies foreign sound patents and a lithograph company after establishing warner bros music harry appointed his son lewis to manage the company by  the studio began to feel the effects of the depression as the public could no longer afford the tickets the studio reportedly lost  million and an additional  million the following year in  warner bros music head lewis warner died from an infected wisdom tooth around that time zanuck hired screenwriter wilson mizner while at the studio mizner had hardly any respect for authority and found it difficult to work with jack but became an asset as time went by warner became more tolerant of mizner and helped invest in mizners brown derby restaurant on april   mizner died from a heart attack by  audiences had grown tired of musicals and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies the public had begun to associate musicals with color and thus studios began to abandon its use warner bros had a contract with technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process as a result the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio doctor x  and mystery of the wax museum  in the latter part of  harry warner rented the teddington studios in london england the studio focused on making quota quickies for the domestic british market and irving asher was appointed as the studios head producer in  harry officially purchased the teddington studios in february  warner bros produced nd street a very successful musical under the direction of lloyd bacon warner assigned bacon to more expensive productions including footlight parade wonder bar broadway gondolier which he also starred in and gold diggers that saved the company from bankruptcy in the wake of nd streets success the studio produced profitable musicals these starred ruby keeler and dick powell and were mostly directed by busby berkeley in  the revival suffered a major blow when berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk by the end of the year people again tired of warner bros musicals and the studio—after the huge profits made by  film captain blood—shifted its focus to errol flynn swashbucklers – precode realistic period with the collapse of the market for musicals warner bros under zanuck turned to more socially realistic storylines for its many films about gangsters warner bros soon became known as a gangster studio the studios first gangster film little caesar was a great box office success and edward g robinson starred in many of the subsequent warner gangster films the studios next effort the public enemy made james cagney arguably the studios new top star and warner bros made more gangster films james cagney and joan blondell in footlight parade  another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed i am a fugitive from a chain gang based on a true story and starring paul muni joining cagney and robinson as one the studios top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film which convinced audiences to question the american legal system by january  the films protagonist robert elliot burns—still imprisoned in new jersey—and other chain gang prisoners nationwide appealed and were released in january  georgia chain gang warden j harold hardy—who was also made into a character in the film—sued the studio for displaying vicious untrue and false attacks against him in the film after appearing in the warners film the man who played god bette davis became a top star in  relief for the studio came after franklin d roosevelt became president and began the new deal this economic rebound allowed warner bros to again become profitable the same year zanuck quit harry warners relationship with zanuck had become strained after harry strongly opposed allowing zanucks film baby face to step outside hays code boundaries the studio reduced his salary as a result of losses from the great depression and harry refused to restore it as the company recovered zanuck established his own company harry thereafter raised salaries for studio employees in  warner was able to link up with newspaper tycoon william randolph hearsts cosmopolitan films hearst had previously worked with mgm but ended the association after a dispute with head producer irving thalberg over the treatment of hearsts longstanding mistress actress marion davies who was struggling for box office success through his partnership with hearst warner signed davies to a studio contract hearsts company and davies films however did not increase the studios profits in  the studio lost over  million of which  was the result of a  fire at the burbank studio destroying  years worth of early vitagraph warner bros and first national films the following year hearsts film adaption of william shakespeares a midsummer nights dream  failed at the box office and the studios net loss increased during this time harry and six other movie studio figures were indicted for conspiracy to violate the sherman antitrust act through an attempt to gain a monopoly over st louis movie theaters in  harry was put on trial after a mistrial harry sold the companys movie theaters and the case was never reopened  also saw the studio make a net profit of  the studio as seen in the trailer for the petrified forest  by  contracts of musical and silent stars were not renewed replaced by toughtalking workingclass types who better fit these pictures dorothy mackaill dolores del río bebe daniels frank fay winnie lightner bernice claire alexander gray alice white and jack mulhall that had characterized the urban modern and sophisticated attitude of the s gave way to james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson warren william and barbara stanwyck who would be more acceptable to the common man the studio was one of the most prolific producers of precode pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency around  as a result warner bros turned to historical pictures from around  to avoid confrontations with the breen office in  following the success of the petrified forest jack signed humphrey bogart to a studio contract warner however did not think bogart was star material and cast bogart in infrequent roles as a villain opposite either james cagney or edward robinson over the next five years after hal b wallis succeeded zanuck in  and the hays code began to be enforced in  the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic idealized pictures the studios historical dramas melodramas or womens pictures swashbucklers and adaptations of bestsellers with stars like bette davis olivia de havilland paul muni and errol flynn avoided the censors in  bette davis by now arguably the studios top star was unhappy with her roles she traveled to england and tried to break her contract davis lost the lawsuit and returned to america although many of the studios employees had problems with jack warner they considered albert and harry fair code era in the s many actors and actresses disappeared who had characterized the realistic precode era but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures warner bros remained a top studio in hollywood but this changed after  as other studios notably mgm quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized warner bros however in the late s bette davis became the studios top draw and was even dubbed as the fifth warner brother humphrey bogart in the petrified forest  in  cagney sued jack warner for breach of contract cagney claimed warner had forced him to star in more films than his contract required cagney eventually dropped his lawsuit after a cash settlement nevertheless cagney left the studio to establish an independent film company with his brother bill the cagneys released their films though grand national films however they were not able to get good financing and ran out of money after their third film cagney then agreed to return to warner bros after jack agreed to a contract guaranteeing cagney would be treated to his own terms after the success of yankee doodle dandy at the box office cagney again questioned if the studio would meet his salary demand and again quit to form his own film production and distribution company with bill another employee with whom warner had troubles was studio producer bryan foy in  wallis hired foy as a producer for the studios low budget bfilms leading to his nickname the keeper of the bs foy was able to garnish arguably more profits than any other bfilm producer at the time during foys time at the studio however warner fired him seven different times during  the story of louis pasteur proved a box office success and star paul muni won the oscar for best actor in march  the studios  film the life of emile zola gave the studio its first best picture oscar in  the studio hired midwestern radio announcer ronald reagan although reagan was initially a bfilm actor warner bros was impressed by his performance in the final scene of knute rockne all american and agreed to pair him with flynn in santa fe trail  reagan then returned to bfilms after his performance in the studios  kings row warner decided to make reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract tripling his salary in  harrys daughter doris read a copy of margaret mitchells gone with the wind and was interested in making a film adaptation doris offered mitchell  for screen rights jack vetoed the deal realizing it would be an expensive production major paramount star george raft also eventually proved to be a problem for jack warner had signed him in  finally bringing the third top s gangster actor into the warners fold knowing that he could carry any gangster picture when either robinson or cagney were on suspension raft had difficulty working with bogart and refused to costar with him eventually warner agreed to release raft from his contract in  after raft had turned the role down the studio gave bogart the role of mad dog roy earle in the  film high sierra which helped establish him as a top star following high sierra and after raft had once again turned the part down bogart was given the leading role in john hustons successful  remake of the studios  precode film the maltese falcon based upon the dashiell hammett novel warners cartoons main articles warner bros cartoons and warner bros animation warners cartoon unit had its roots in the independent harman and ising studio from  to  disney alumni hugh harman and rudolf ising produced musical cartoons for leon schlesinger who sold them to warner harman and ising introduced their character bosko in the first looney tunes cartoon sinkin in the bathtub and created a sister series merrie melodies in  harman and ising broke away from schlesinger in  due to a contractual dispute taking bosko with them to mgm as a result schlesinger started his own studio

wild hare and tweety who debuted in the  short a tale of two kitties achieved star power by  the schlesinger studio had surpassed walt disney studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts warner bros eventually bought schlesingers cartoon unit in  and renamed it warner bros cartoons unfortunately the unit was indifferently treated by senior management beginning with the installation of edward selzer as senior producer whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent jack had little regard for the companys short film product and reputedly was so ignorant about the animation division of the studio that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of mickey mouse walt disney productions flagship character he sold off the units preaugust  library for  each which proved a shortsighted transaction in light of its eventual value warner bros cartoons continued with intermittent interruptions until  when it was dissolved as the parent company ceased film shorts entirely characters such as bugs bunny daffy duck tweety bird sylvester and porky pig became central to the companys image in subsequent decades bugs in particular remains a mascot to warner bros its various divisions and six flags which time warner once owned the success of the compilation film the bugs bunnyroad runner movie in  featuring the archived film of these characters

afterwards de haviland discovered employment contracts in the united states could only last seven years de haviland had been under contract with the studio since  the court ruled in de havilands favor and she left the studio through de havilands victory many of the studios longtime actors were now freed from their contracts and harry decided to terminate the studios suspension policy the same year

jack had problems with milton berles unsuccessful film always leave them laughing during the peak of berles television popularity warner felt that berle was not strong enough to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free however jack was pressured into using berle replacing danny kaye with him berles outrageous behavior on the set and the films

his position to his longtime publicity director ben kalmenson warner remained on board as an independent producer and vicepresident with the  success of bonnie and clyde warner bros was again profitable two years later the hymans were tired and fed up with jack warner and his actions they accepted a cashandstock offer from kinney national company for more than  million kinney owned a hollywood talent agency ashleyfamous whose founder ted ashley led kinney head steve ross to purchase warner bros ashley became the studio head and changed the name to warner bros inc once again jack warner was outraged by the hymans sale and decided to retire until his death from serious health complications of heart inflammation in august  although movie audiences had shrunk warners new management believed in the drawing power of stars signing coproduction deals with several of the biggest names of the day including paul newman robert redford barbra streisand and clint eastwood carrying the studio successfully through the s and s warner bros also made major profits on films and television shows built around the characters of superman batman and wonder woman owned by warner bros subsidiary dc comics abandoning parking lots and funeral homes the refocused kinney renamed itself in honor of its bestknown holding warner communications throughout the s and s warner communications branched out into other business such as video game company atari inc in  and later the six flags theme parks from  until the end of  warners international distribution operations were a joint venture with columbia pictures in some countries this joint venture distributed films from other companies such as emi films and cannon films in the uk warner ended the venture in  and partnered with walt disney pictures this joint venture lasted until  when disney created buena vista international in  in a costcutting move warner and columbia formed a third company called the burbank studios tbs they would share the warner lot in burbank both studios technically became production entities giving tbs daytoday responsibility for studio grounds and upkeep the columbia ranch about a mile north of warners lot was part of the deal the warnercolumbia relationship was acrimonious but the reluctance of both studios to approve or spend money on capital upgrades that might only help the other did have the unintended consequence of preserving the warner lots primary function as a filmmaking facility while it produced relatively little during the s and s most films produced after  were filmed on location after the failure of camelot was partially attributed to the fact it was set in england but obviously filmed in burbank with control over its own lot tied up in tbs warner ultimately retained a significant portion of its backlot while fox sold its backlot to create century city universal turned part of its backlot into a theme park and shopping center and disney replaced its backlot with office buildings and exiled its animation department to an industrial park in glendale in  a solution to the situation became evident when warner bros acquired lorimartelepictures and gained control of the former mgm studio lot in culver city and that same year sony bought columbia pictures sony was flush with cash and warner bros now had two studio lots in  tbs ended when sony bought the mgm lot from warner and moved columbia to culver city however warner kept the columbia ranch now known as the warner bros ranch warner communications merged in  with whiteshoe publishing company time inc time claimed a higher level of prestige while warner bros provided the profits the time warner merger was almost derailed when paramount communications formerly
