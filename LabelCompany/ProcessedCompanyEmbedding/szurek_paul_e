the time to join us today im glad to share our second quarter financial and operating results as well as update you on our markets and our outlook on supply and demand financial results for the second quarter were strong again with yearoveryear increases in revenue of  while adjusted ebitda and ffo per share grew  and  yearoveryear respectively very strong leasing volume of  million in annualized gaap rent signed in q included a significant expansion with the fortune  customer in the los angeles market and several other key deployments overall it was an unusual quarter for leasing with existing customers representing  of new and expansion sales reflecting the organic growth needs of customers in our markets and an increase in the percentage of sales in funnel related to larger deployments correspondently retail collocation sales were  million  below the trailing  month average we saw a similar pattern in q  when we had another surge in sales of larger deployments going forward we believe these scale deployments and the services they represent are key components of our cloud enabled data center product they will continue to increase the attraction of our data centers to enterprises and networks and lay the foundation for continued successful campus expansions these deployments illustrate the importance of network density plus scalable solutions in large edge markets which characterizes our national data center platform we also continue to see a steady influx of new logos joining the coresite ecosystem each quarter with  new logos entering our customer base in q net of customer churn we added  new logos across our markets demand remains consistent and absorption over the last two years has exceeded our forecast while supply remains generally in balance or in a couple of markets constrained given the strong demand and the organic growth inherent in our existing customer base we currently have a number of projects under construction to enable us to continue to meet customer demand across our markets as well as working through the process of planning new data centers in markets that are most inventory constrained in los angeles the  squarefeet that we commenced construction on during the first quarter is now  preleased as a result of q leasing in order to maintain available capacity in the market and keep up with overall strong demand we have commenced construction of an incremental  squarefeet of turnkey datacenter space at la consistent with what i mentioned earlier we are accelerating the initial development plans for la on land we already owned adjacent to la but which is not yet entitled and permitted for construction we have commenced the permitting and entitlement process for this asset in the bay area absorption continues to outpace historical levels while supply remains limited across the market and occupancy levels are elevated we are optimistic about the funnel in this market for both larger footprint requirements that need the performance and connectivity to support edge notes and for performance and geographic sensitive retail collocations as it relates to the land on a contract for sba we are substantially complete with our due diligence and anticipate closing in mid q please keep in mind that we currently estimate the first phase of capacity of sba would come online approximately  to  months after we close on the land purchase based on our expectations around timing for permitting and entitlements regarding northern virginia and dc demand and absorption continue to be strong occupancy rates remain high in this market and a number of datacenter providers have land to develop new capacity primarily for wholesale deployments and some had commenced construction although we believe the majority of the new construction is preleased we are under construction on a total of  square feet across the market with development in downtown dc expansion of va and initial development at va we see good activity in the sales pipeline and continue to have discussions with customers for preleasing opportunities at va where we expect to deliver  square feet or  megawatts of turnkey datacenter capacity in the fourth quarter we also expect to commence construction in the third quarter on phase b a  squarefoot building of  megawatts plus a centralized infrastructure building to serve the entire va property at an estimated cost of  million in denver we are nearing completion on the first phase of expansion of de and expect to place into service  square feet of turnkey capacity in q supply across this market remains limited and we see good opportunities to support customer demand during the second quarter we signed a midsize prelease with a company that will be a valuable addition to our ecosystem finally in the new york new jersey market we saw an uptick in both square footage and annualized gaap rent signed in q this march the third straight quarter of increasing sales in this market and that trend should continue a bit longer ny again accounted for the majority of new and expansion leasing in this market as well as all of the new logo growth in the quarter enterprise activity was strong accounting for  of the annualized gaap rent signed here while all of the new logo signed in the quarter within this vertical in closing we are pleased with our financial performance and sales results in the second quarter especially our securing of key ecosystem building blocks which provide a strong impetus for growth in  and beyond we continue to believe the flexibility of our platform our network density and cloud on ramps and our vibrant ecosystem make coresite uniquely positioned to capture demand in a world of increasingly data intensive applications with that i will turn the call over to steve paul szurek thanks paul ill begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activity during the second quarter and then discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results in q we signed  new and expansion leases totaling  million in annualized gaap rent comprised of  net rentable squarefeet at an average gaap rate of  per squarefoot note that this rate excludes revenue associated with contractually reserved data center space across our platform our ability to support evolving customer it workloads from tradition enterprises with hybrid and multi cloud requirements to high density large scale deployments coupled with access to hundreds of network and cloud service providers continues to differentiate coresite we are encouraged with the increasing value of this ecosystem as we add more new customers that contribute to the overall attractiveness of our platform as paul noted new logo growth was strong again in q and we continue to be pleased with the quality of applications and customers that are coming to coresite datacenters included in this quarters new enterprise logos is a consulting and technology services company two financial services organizations our retail ecommerce site an international consultancy specializing for interaccounting and data analytics and an international online commerce and payments ecosystem additionally existing customer expansions which have historically accounted for  to  of sales on a quarterly basis continue to be a strong source of growth this includes customers that either increase their current deployment or expand through additional markets during the second quarter we have some powerful examples of customers expanding their applications andor infrastructure closer to the edge first a large public cloud customer expanded with us in new york and is deploying infrastructure to establish a metro ring around the new york new jersey market so that customers can distribute traffic more efficiently to and from their edge sites the same customer will be deploying a number of applications in our denver market representing their first deployment in this area of the us second a large content company expanded its existing environment with us in los angeles as well as established a new deployment with coresite in northern virginia both expansions were part of this customers ongoing efforts to increase capacity at the edge to support existing customers and new initiatives such as streaming video and tv applications lastly a digital media company expanded with us in new york to support high performance video streaming of sporting events overall we continue to see growth in cloud deployments throughout the portfolio as data intensive use cases appear to be increasing with the expansions of existing customers and the new customer activity contribute to the vibrant interconnection density of our datacenters in q interconnection revenue grew  yearoveryear reflecting total volume growth of  including  growth in fiber cross connects with respect to the vertical mix within our ecosystem during q net work and cloud customers each accounted for  of annualized gaap rent signed specific to the cloud vertical we continue to see good traction with four new logos including an international infrastructure as a service provider and a global provider of online business solutions additionally we signed an expansion with a cloud contact center provider as well as an expansion within edge cloud platform serving digital businesses the network vertical saw a strong activity during the quarter which was the result of both new customer growth as well as expansions we had five new logos join our ecosystem including an international communication solution company and a global virtual phone number provider additionally we signed expansions with six fortune  network customers during the quarter network demand was broad based with new and expansion leases signed in every one of our markets as it relates to our enterprise vertical this vertical accounted for  of annualized gaap rent signed in the second quarter our enterprise vertical which represents approximately  of our embedded base captures not only pure enterprise deployments but also includes cloud deployments that may reside within an enterprise company looking at q performance across the vertical was strong led by strategic content expansions for compute catching nodes at the edge as well as expansions with six fortune  companies as paul discussed we executed a larger expansion with an existing fortune  customer for their edge compute deployment at la in addition we signed an expansion of our strategic content customer’s network pop in boston and another strategic content customer’s edge nodes in los angeles and northern virginia lastly we executed an expansion of fortune  customer’s online video streaming services in silicon valley from a geographic perspective our strongest markets in terms of annualized gaap rent signed in new and expansion leases during q were los angeles silicon valley and northern virginia dc collectively representing  of annualized gaap rent signed in the quarter as i touched on earlier demand in los angeles was impacted by the expansion of an existing fortune  content company apart from that specific lease demand was led by the enterprise vertical followed by networks and cloud providers stabilized occupancy across the los angeles campus was  at the end of q up  basis points from q activity across the bay area was strong led by the enterprise vertical or by cloud deployments our network dense access in the silicon valley market continues to be attractive for enterprises with two new logos signed this quarter stabilized occupancy across our silicon valley campuses decreased  basis points to  due to some modest churn at se and se in northern virginia dc demand continues to be weighted toward smaller enterprise deployments from both existing customers and new logos we saw good demand from cloud customers with three new logos in this market stabilized occupancy across northern virginia dc now stands at  a decrease of  basis points on a sequential basis reflecting some customer churn at va to wrap up we continue to be pleased with the sale performance in the quarter and we’ll continue to focus on driving added value across our operating portfolio by attracting synergistic deployments to our datacenters i will now turn the call over to jeff jeff finnin thanks steve and hello everyone my remarks today will begin with a review of our q financial results followed by an update on our development capex and our leverage and liquidity capacity i will then conclude my remarks with an update on our  guidance q financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of  million a  increase on a sequential quarter basis and  increase yearoveryear q operating revenue consisted of  million in rental and power revenue from datacenter space up  on a sequential quarter basis and  yearoveryear interconnection services revenue contributed  million to operating revenues in q an increase of  on a sequential quarter basis and  yearoveryear and tenant reimbursement and other revenues were  million office and light industrial revenue was  million q ffo was  per diluted share in unit a decrease of  on a sequential quarter basis and an increase of  yearoveryear this sequential decline reflects the final expiration of our original full building customers lease at sv as well as the financings executed in april in addition we saw an acceleration of decreased power margin in the quarter that we typically see in q q ffo also includes a benefit equal to approximately  per share related to a real estate tax accrual true up adjusted ebitda of  million increased  on a sequential quarter basis and  over the same quarter last year our margins expanded again this quarter with our adjusted ebitda margin expanding to  measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including q  this represents an increase of  basis points over the comparable year ago period related trailing  months revenue flow through to adjusted ebitda and ffo was  and  respectively sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter totaled  million or  of total operating revenues down  basis points yearoveryear general and administrative expenses were  million in q or  of total operating revenues a decrease of  basis points yearoveryear for the full year we continue to expect ga expense to be approximately  of total operating revenues in line with the yeartodate level now turning to our same store metrics q same store turnkey data center occupancy increased  basis points to  from  in the second quarter of  additionally same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased  yearoveryear and  sequentially to  turning to renewals in q we renewed approximately  total squarefeet at an annualized gaap rate of  per square foot our renewal pricing reflects marktomarket growth of  on a cash basis and  on a gaap basis as a reminder we expect cash rent growth of approximately  for  churn in the second quarter was  and included  basis points of churn related to the final lease expiration of our original full building customer ion sv we commenced  net rentable squarefeet of new and expansion leases at an annualized gaap rent of  per square foot which represents  million of annualized gaap rent we ended the second quarter with our stabilized datacenter occupancy at  a decrease of  basis points compared to the first quarter primarily due to  squarefeet of turnkey capacity at ny that moved into the stabilized operating portfolio from prestabilized at  occupancy yearoveryear stabilized datacenter occupancy increased  basis points turning now to backlog projected annualized gaap rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was  million as of june   and  million on a cash basis we expect approximately  of the gaap backlog to commence during the second half of  with the remainder expected to commence in the first quarter of  turning to our development activity as paul mentioned we had a number of projects under development at the end of q with a total of  squarefeet of turnkey datacenter capacity under construction as of june   this includes development and expansion projects in northern virginia washington dc los angeles denver and boston as of the end of the second quarter we had spent  million of the estimated  million required to complete these projects the percentage of interest capitalized in q was  and the yeartodate amount is  for  we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of  to  turning to our balance sheet as of june   our ratio of net principle debt to q annualized adjusted ebitda was  times including preferred stock the ratio was  times as if the end of the second quarter we had  million of total liquidity consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility this increased level of liquidity reflects the two financing transactions completed in april resulting in an incremental  million in available liquidity as well as the fact that we had no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility at the end of the second quarter as it relates to our dividend during the second quarter we announced an increase in our dividend to  per share on a quarterly basis at this level for the remainder of the year we would pay a dividend of  per share equal to approximately  of ffo based on the current midpoint of guidance the  per share quarterly dividend represents  or  increase over the prior quarterly dividend we took the opportunity to raise the dividend again six months after the last increase to more accurately reflect the recent performance of the company and our sustainable cash flow levels in addition over the last  years as a public company we have grown more comfortable with our visibility into the business allowing us to increase the ffo payout ratio from the historical level of  to  to approximately  which is more in line with the reit industry average payout now in closing i would like to address our updated guidance for  i would remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy we do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today as detailed on page  of our q earnings supplemental our guidance for  is as follows total operating revenue is now estimated to be  million to  million compared to the previous range of  to  million based on the midpoint of guidance this implies  yearoveryear revenue growth keep in mind that our revenue guidance is dependent upon the power product composition of deployments within our portfolio and how quickly the larger metered power deployments install their infrastructure and ramp into their associated power requirements as it relates to interconnection revenue growth we now expect the  revenue growth to be in line with the higher end of the range of  to  adjusted ebitda is now estimated to be  million to  million an increase of  million based on the midpoint of current and previous guidance this correlates to  yearoveryear growth based on the midpoint of the range and adjusted ebitda margin of approximately  and revenue flow through to adjusted ebitda of approximately  ffo is estimated to be  to  per share and op unit this midpoint of  per share represents an increase of  per share and implies  yearoveryear ffo growth compared to the  per share we reported in  as we mentioned last quarter we expect the first half and second half ffo per share to be generally balanced based on our expectation of relatively flat sequential growth until q with growth resuming that quarter and into  reflecting the full contribution from the cumulative effect of new and expansion leasing in addition as i mentioned earlier in q we have historically seen a seasonal impact related to higher power costs amounting to approximately  to  per share as it relates to our guidance for capital expenditures in  we are decreasing the total expected investment to a range of  million to  million from the previous range of  million to  million the decrease is based on our outlook for the timing around datacenter expansion investment related to some of the larger development projects across our portfolio we now expect datacenter expansion investment of  million to  million compared to the prior range of  million to  million additionally as we discussed last quarter we commence spending on the project to replace our chiller plant at la which is recorded as recurring capital and deducted from affo while this impacts sequential affo growth we continue to expect this investment to generate a return on investment that is substantially higher than our overall stated return objectives now we’d like to open the call to questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time we’ll be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from jordan sadler from keybanc capital markets please go ahead jordan sadler first question regarding the funnel it sounded like paul in your opening remarks you talked about an increase and that related to some larger scale deals can you maybe offer a little bit more insight in terms of the flavor the nature of the requirements that you’re seeing out there paul szurek jordan putting it as simply as possible these are higher density requirements but the lot of data in them and a lot of data being either exchanged or pushed out of the network so there is obviously tremendous operational and cost advantage for processing that much data moving that much data through interconnection as opposed to other ways of doing it from further out datacenters jordan sadler are these cloud service provider oriented or is it just more enterprise paul szurek i think it’s a mix and steve can shed some more color on it primarily cloud and content and to a lesser extent enterprise steve smith i would say that cloud content and even enterprise are becoming more and more susceptible to the tolerance of latency which is becoming less and less by consumers suppliers and customers in general so as that expectation of the general consumer there is more real time companies are having to solve for that and that involves moving computing data closer to the edge jordan sadler just thoughts on some of the competition that you’re seeing from if at all and it may actually be complimentary based on what you’re seeing of the fdns i mean is that helping facilitate some of these lower latency requirements or are they i guess complimenting your efforts or are they intersecting it another way paul szurek i think they’re generally complimentary to our efforts again the types of deployments that have to go to the edge really have volumes of data that they’re exchanging at much quicker pace that require that close that interconnection as opposed to having to go through different forms of networks whether their fdn metro fiber or other ways of moving traffic around between datacenters steve anything youd add to that steve smith no id just echo that as far as being complementary i think anytime you give customers choice an ability to access other environments within our data center thats a good things for those customers its good thing for the end customer and ultimately that ends up being a good thing for us because we typically have that compute within our datacenters so we have many of those sdn providers that have built into our datacenters and that gives not only customers with their access to those deployments that are there but also customers that are introduced that may want to access in environments that maybe other places that gives them choice and flexibility as well so so far weve seen it to be very complementary jordan sadler and then lastly on sv how do you expect that product to orient itself and be presented to the market will that be an opportunity to sign another larger scale deal do you think and is there an opportunity to prelease that so far in advance or will that be more of an extension in the campus and youd look to build that out a bit more gradually and just be a source of inventory paul szurek well predicting that far out is never precise so i think the simple way to answer it is its going to be an extension of a campus if you look at that campus historically it has periodically had opportunities for preleases and theres every reason to believe that that activity maybe available when we bring sv to market otherwise well continue the mix of scale deployments and transactional deployments that have characterized that campus so far operator our next question is from dave rogers from robert w baird please go ahead dave rogers one of the followup obviously a lot of questions or comments this quarter around enterprise and the strength in enterprise and i just wanted to maybe understand better if there was a shift in terms of how youre thinking about it internally from enterprise as a cloud customer or cloud being categorized now under enterprise in the sense of what the customer is doing in that space and i guess maybe the broader question is are you seeing a slowdown in the cloud activity and enterprise is taking over or is it one quarter doesnt make a trend just any color there would be helpful paul szurek just to give you a bit of clarity there and maybe just doesnt help on the clarity because i think what youre seeing is that many content customers are also cloud customers and many cloud customers are also content customers and that leaves open to tradition enterprise even so what youre seeing is a lot of customers leveraging technology differently that bleeds those verticals a bit so i think thats part of what youre seeing as far as how we categorize them but as far as overall demand in the marketplace were still seeing very strong demand from the traditional enterprise its collocating we do see greater adoption as youve seen from the cloud providers and those enterprises going to the cloud but we still see plenty of run way for those enterprises to come into our data centers and especially as you like to medium to large enterprise therell be plenty of opportunity ahead of us that’s not necessarily a feasible or a very quick journey for them to move entirely through that model dave rogers with regard to revenues and maybe a followup on the prior question paul you talked in the prepared comments i think as well as in that answer about higher density are we seeing that come through the average rate has it being masked in any way and maybe second revenue question for jeff how much of that was reserved capacity that you recorded in the quarter in terms of signings paul szurek the reserve capacity was not material and obviously for accurate disclosure we’ve excluded that from the rate category density does have some impact on rate per square foot and we like and have set ourselves up to accommodate higher density requirements for that purpose we tend to look at pricing overall on quartertoquarter on an applestoapples basis we breakout by categories of deployment size and markets and density and when you look at all of that together the net pricing seem to be about  quarteroverquarter so there is more than just increased density that’s driving the price increases jeff finnin dave just to clarify as paul just related to that  increase would strip out some of the wholesale deals we did because those just aren’t comparatively quartertoquarter and that  is on a trailing  compared to the trailing  months basis dave rogers maybe last from me i think the one market you didn’t talk about paul in the comments if i missed it was chicago is it just that you’re not seeing the opportunity the ability to get into more land there or are the opportunities just in la with the resurgence there just taking precedence in your mind paul szurek no we continue to look for expansion capacity in chicago we expect that over the next couple of three years our customers in our existing chicago facility are going to need that and will drive other opportunities we continue to work on some opportunities there and we just don’t have anything that is ready to announce but that’s a good market and we’ve got a good data centre that’s performing well in that market operator our next question comes from colby synesael from cowen  company please go ahead colby synesael it looks like there is a variety of projects that got pushed out of quarter so whether those were  some of those are supposed to open up in the  period or some in late ’ that are now opening up in ’ i’m curious if what’s behind is is it simply just coincidental that there is so many of them this particular quarter that got pushed out and when you look at the amount of money you’re spending in terms of capex for the projects that are anticipated to open up in  well i appreciate it’s still early any thoughts on what capex could look like next year it seems like it could be down again next year versus  and then also on rest and i think everybody is looking to see when you guys signed in anchor tenant deal that’s expected to open up in the fourth quarter this year you mentioned i think that the funnel is pretty strong is it fair to assume that we’ll most likely see something in the third quarter thank you paul szurek i think it’s mostly coincidental that some projects got pushed back quarter and i think it’s partly coincidental that we had so many projects going on at the same time one of the attractions of our markets is that the regulatory and entitlement process create barriers to entry and although that’s a pain in the neck in the shortterm that sometime it takes longer to get permits and entitlements than it does in other markets we’ve all seen that in every real estate product that creates value for the long term because the local government provides one of those barriers to entry to new product so that’s mostly what we have seen with these deployments i don’t view it as a big deal but we just try to keep everybody informed about it jeff finnin the other question was related to  capex and colby i guess the thing that i would think about as you think about capex levels for  is just take a look at the more recent three year trend in terms of what our annual capex has been that’s going to give you some level of inside into what that might possibly be for  but at this point we’re just not ready to give any specific guidance on  capex paul szurek and i wouldn’t draw too many conclusions though we do have as you know a couple of larger projects that depending on when permitting and entitlement is completed could start construction in  at some point as well that we mentioned in both the press release and in our scripts jeff finnin and then colby if i wrote down your question correctly your third question was related to va and how are we doing in terms of progress for lease up for developments coming online there and paul and steve could probably give you some color on that paul szurek so i do want to point out that we’ve got two components to va we’ve got the  megawatt build out of an existing computer room that we’re really targeting to be more for the transactional and smaller deployments and then the larger  megawatt building that would cover more scale deployments we cant provide  i don’t want to predict the future with any grade certainly but yes we’ve got a lot of good discussions going on and i would expect some announcement some time later this year if those discussions continue to proceed at pace operator our next question will come from jonathan atkin from rbc capital markets please go ahead jonathan atkin so couple of questions one on markets that you’re in that a lot of your peers are dallas and portland and just kind of an update on how you view the pros and cons of inorganic growth maybe greenfield to brownfield developments in those metros secondly probably for steve but just maybe an update on sales headcount trends and how much of your leasing recently has been due to direct versus indirect sales channel contributions and then i was curious about sv in the backfill the prospects of backfill is that going to be scale deployments retail and how the technical attributes to that site compare to sv paul szurek let me take the first and the last question and then steve will address the second one we look at every opportunity that makes at the triage to expand into other big markets now the thing that we repeated in the past and is worth completing here is that we really like big markets with a lot of business activity our current eight markets are  of the us population  of us gdp and have a much higher level of business activity and data intensive activity than the typical market there are other markets that meet those categories our business model as you know is successful primarily because were able to merry up a network dense node with scalable interconnection ability within the campus or building environment and that makes the screen a little bit finer for new opportunities but those are the opportunities that like our current portfolio create the best long term sustainable value and so thats what we look for and so far weve seen only denver work is expanded into or have that opportunity but we continue to look for that in other areas i do think we can bring some tools to the tables that are not generally out there we have in a couple of three instances been able to create network dense nodes where they did not exist before and so thats an opportunity we might bring to bear in another market if we can find the right price point and size to enter and have visibility to scale at attractive returns so i hope that helps answer that question on sv i just want to remind you that we didnt actually have a tenant move out of sv that is the payments from the original tenant at sv that they paid out as part of their moving out of that space sv is pretty fully occupied right now technologically its in the same category as everything else on the santa clara campus steve smith thanks paul and jonathan just to answer your question and relative to sales headcount and trending and so forth weve been roughly at the same headcount little bit of fluctuation throughout the year and for the last year and a half i guess but overall we havent had any major changes as far as headcount is concerned a few changes here and there as you would expect in any sales organization but overall weve been fairly stable and really just working towards getting our talent betterandbetter every year our skill level better every year and just get better utilization out of the people that we do have which kind of leans through the second part of your question which i think was around direct versus indirect and channel and that ratio typically is up  to  of our overall sales as far as the indirect channel is concerned we do look to try to leverage that and getting additional value and getting deeper and wider within our accounts and markets and well continue to do that but thats strictly opportunistic and thats off pay our resources that we try to leverage and represent itself and as the value presents itself so continues to be a focus and we’ll leverage it as best we can jonathan atkin and then last question is on artificial intelligence and i dont know if this ties into the power density comments earlier or not but to what extent are you seeing that as a current absorber of market capacity overall for the industry or driving rfp activity or is that kind of more on the come and do you see that as from what you understand that ai is that performance sensitive meaning that it needs house in major metros or is it may be less performance sensitive more computing sensitive in secondary markets thanks paul szurek jonathan i’ll start with that and then steve can chime in if he has anything to add i think that product category is in early stages but there is definitely elements of it that are data and compute and performance sensitive where the insides generated from the ai algorithms lose value if there is too much latency and are responding and reacting to so much data exchange that interconnection is valuable at this point i cant really predict how large that opportunity becomes but it does seem promising at this point for the future steve smith and i would agree with you paul and depending upon how ai is a pretty broad bucket and how its defined but i think if you look at some of the most obvious examples of that and the terms of automated vehicles and so forth that obviously is very latency sensitive and these make decisions quickly and react quickly so we’ve had several examples of startups and so forth that our deployment in our datacenters because of need for latency as well as scalability and i think you just have to look deeper as to the use case and the need for that latency but i think inherently as you look at intelligence and being able to make smarter decisions quicker that brings with it the need for low latency and speed operator our next question comes from robert gutman from guggenheim securities please go ahead robert gutman in light of the high growth in interconnection yearoveryear i was wondering if you could provide some incremental color on some of the applications that are driving that and just some greater detail on whether true sustainable at this level as its really above our guidance range for the year jeff finnin rob its jeff let me just give you some commentary around that as you probably saw obviously the revenue this report this quarter was up  yearoveryear if you look at the underlying volumes where we’re seeing particular strength are those deployments where people want to be connected to the cloud environments and if you just look at the overall volume increase going to and connecting with our cloud customers its probably x what it is in general of the portfolio overall it gives some idea of whats going on there obviously in some of the commentary i gave around guidance our initial guidance range of  to  for the year given that we’re yeartodate at  and we expect that to be at the upper end of that range but we’ll see how the second half of the year migrates here operator our next question comes from frank louthan from raymond james please go ahead frank louthan you mentioned a couple of markets you said were seemed a bit constrained even what are the pricing trends there and do you expect that  how long do you expect that to be the case and are you seeing anyone acting irrationally in any of your markets how would you characterize the mindset of some of your competitors you see in the markets thanks paul szurek let me address the second question first we have not seen any irrational behavior just to give an example of market northern virginia has seen the most development activity as i mentioned in my remarks there is significant new development going on there but most of it to our knowledge is preleased and i suspect there is probably some leases out there that we’re not aware of that takes the member up higher but even if if you look out going forward if the only amounts in that market that are under construction that are preleased or what we think we know about that might move the vacancy rate and there is no other change in absorption that might move the vacancy rate by the end of the year early next year from like maybe  to  so not a huge move but given our own funnel in that area my guess is there is probably more leasing going on and we are aware of in other areas with other companies so not seeing any place in any of our markets where development behavior concerns me in the constrained markets there has been some pricing uplift i think that’s reflected in our overall number of  that jeff and i sighted to you earlier but the pricing uplift is i would say measured as opposed to dramatic there is this one phenomenon that goes into the datacenter industry that we see from time to time which is that sometimes markets have to have a little bit of supply or latent supply in order to attract more demand and so constrained markets tend to see things balanced out a little bit more than you would than you would see in other real estate markets where people just don’t have any choice about when they move into something operator and our next question comes from andrew degasperi from macquarie capital please go ahead andrew degasperi im not sure if you already touched on this but you mentioned the  million guidance on lease commencements for this year if my guess is correct you are about  if include the backlog that you expect to realize is that a conservative number and then secondly can you just let us know what the timing is around the la property and when you’re going to bring that online thank you jeff finnin andy let me take the first part of that question and then paul can add some commentary on the second one but you’re right we have given some earlier guidance around commencements for the year of about  million and you can look at where we are yeartodate at  and we said that the backlog about  of that would commence so you’re directionally you’re fairly close in terms of where we expect or at least what we have visibility into we’re right around  just north of  million and so while we believe obviously we’ve got the second half of the year we’ve got some visibility in what we think that will be if i had to even amount i would say would be at or slightly ahead of the  million guidance we gave earlier this year hopefully that helps paul szurek andrew in terms of the next building in la little bit hard to predict just because again that’s one of those infill markets where the path of entitlements and permitting is not clearly definable but i would say that best case it would be first quarter of  and then when it actually comes on board in  and when we actually start it depends on that permitting process and frankly the continuation of strong demand in the los angeles market operator our next question comes from michael rollins from citi research please go ahead michael rollins just have couple of questions if i could first when you look at the cost of building out new datacenter development over the last few years do you see that as inflationary in terms of the component cost versus technology which is generally deflationary just want to get a sense of how do you look at those build costs overtime and then secondly if you could just talk a little bit further about what you described as demand closer to the edge and so whats that doing to demand for market away from the edge and how does that affect pricing and value for those types of markets versus the ones that youre seeing more favorable demand thanks paul szurek the cost of building generally has been stable modest inflation components not as much like everyone in construction labor has been where youve seen the biggest inflation the component of that relative to overall cost is much more percentage in datacenters which are very equipment intensive than it is in other product so we havent seen that turn into a real problem at the same time we continue to do it all our peers do and i give brian warren our svp of engineering construction and his team a lot of credit for continuing to develop improvements in our processes and our designs in the way we do our construction to deliver to keep our price per kilowatt at a very good level so dont see any big area of concern there the things that are driving demand closer to the edge and therere a couple of good articles out there and that summarizes and it’s supplemented extensively by what we see in our own deployments and the companies that come to us for the space weve always  performance latency has always been an issue for many i mean some products especially if they’re going to consumers and businesses they have to have very good latency in order to be successful think about ecommerce video streaming video on demand all those sort of things and frankly moreandmore cloud  some cloud development compute platforms and others the customers theyre serving are latency sensitive but theres another factor that has emerged that i think is gaining an importance and maybe becoming as important as latency and thats just the sheer volume of data for particular applications that need to be crunched very quickly and exchanged with customers and other peers pretty quickly and that just creates engineering challenges for doing that thing further away from the edge further away from the network node and in an environment where you’ve got to go worse case over the internet best case over some type of wan process but were even like  milliseconds of delay and how these thousands of transactions get processed or data exchanges get processed can really clog that performance and that data intensity is whats driving more  has driven some of the good traffic weve seen in these larger scale deployments at the edge nodes lately as much as  may be as much as the performance sensitivity and we have seen we have customers that have moved deployments from lower cost places further away into our datacenters in order to overcome both the cost and the operating inefficiencies of exchanging that data outside an interconnected environment steve smith i would agree with that paul and i think the only thing i would add to that is mobile traffic is also a huge contributor to that as you see more and more mobile device and doesn’t where you walk down the street or airplanes or anywhere else everyone’s got a mobile device and you see a lot of video streaming that’s happening on those which drives this huge amount of data and so having that data and throughput closer to where those mobile networks interconnect is also critical in order to get that performance level up whether its a content provider or cloud provider or even an enterprise there is a balance that they work and it’s a math equation on their end to figure out latency relative to constants and support to that deployment so you have seen even in some cases some of these other providers moving into secondary markets and where it justifies that cost and expense but in the markets that were in it’s a fairly easy math problem to compute given the number of eyeballs and networks and demand that’s there for them to establish those points of presence operator our next question is from matthew heinz from stifel please go ahead matthew heinz im curious just about the engineering challenges may be for some of the order or more highly connected edge colo sites as youre referring to the power density requirements going up do you feel that some of these order buildings are properly equipped to handle denser requirements not only now but where you anticipate they could go and i guess what impact did this have the economics generally across the industry because we see upward pressure on maintenance or upgrade expenditures for new power and cooling systems as this trend potentially continues and accelerates paul szurek well i think the old carrier tells and the traditional network dense nodes and office buildings are always going to have their core and faithful customers who will deploy in those environments equipment of density that those environments can handle but they are constrained that’s why we develop the campus model to interconnect with some of our network nodes directly for loading requirements in some of those older office building don’t allow for as much density the heavier racks heavier servers there are also harder to cool efficiently they are not raised for environments so you’re flooding the computer rooms with cold there generally there is not as much as you can do with hot and cold aisle containment although we do as much as we can in our facilities like that so as the actual data intensely and the amount of cash of storage and compute that you need at the edge that goes along with those network nodes grows and requires more density the scalable options that we provide in our campus environments where they are purpose built they are raised for environments you can put  its easier to put in cold aisle containment we can drive puv down and the fur loading is not an issue they serve a real purpose million that’s  we tried to explain and maybe haven’t done a good job but that’s driven a lot of our growth is our ability to provide that type of more efficient more dense environment close to these traditional network nodes where target create that kind of density and that kind of power and cooling efficiency but i still think we still continue to see strong demand for deployments of smaller types of broader enterprise and networks and then some of the companies that use networks extensively in those network nodes in those traditional carrier hotel buildings steve smith matt in regards to the second part of your question in terms of capital cost for recurring maintenance i think the important aspect to think about if you just look at us historically we’ve been  our recurring capex has been anywhere between  to  of revenues while that’s all you and the street have visibility until we continue to think about the best way to think of that is on a per kilowatt basis having said that we don’t give visibility into that so its hard really for you guys to gauge what that’s going to be but i would think as we look forward and based on some of the experience we’ve seen for  a range as a percentage of revenue of  to  is probably reasonable range to think about for coresite i don’t think that helps meaningfully but it is something that we think about in terms of the go forward modeling et cetera so hopefully that helps paul szurek i would like to add on that because as steve mentioned of the core chiller replacement in some reports and again put the blame on us for not explaining that more carefully we did not have to replace all those chillers that we’re replacing this year those are multiple units of chillers that could have been replaced over the next two to four years and what kept our capex expenditures in line with historical averages however we had the opportunity to do something totally different which was combined all of them instead of replacing them with more small chillers combine all of them in a single large chiller plant that serves other space as well and is so much more power efficient that the return on investment on just rolling these into this bigger project is probably higher than anything else in our portfolio whereas if we just follow the traditional method of replacing them each of them as they got to end of life we would not have that opportunity to achieve that power efficiency because theres still physical limitations on how power efficient a smaller chiller can be so i know that to be pure on the affo count and we put that in the right bucket for recurring capex but it has a tremendous return associated with it and continues our path that we pursue aggressively towards more power efficiency matthew heinz do you think theyre ahead of your peers on replacing some of the equipment or upgrading some of the equipment that you think will drive added advantage paul szurek honestly i cant say anything about that because i dont really have visibility into what theyre doing im guessing that part of the reason our release results are so good is that our pue is at least viewed as not a negative maybe its viewed as a positive but i just really don’t know how to compare with peers on that point operator our next question comes from lukas hartwich from green street advisors please go ahead lukas hartwich net neutrality seems like its back in the public debate again im just curious what corsites stance is on that issue paul szurek from which perspective lukas lukas hartwich i guess are you on the side of the more of the tech industry and pushing for the net neutrality provisions or are you more on the side of the sounds like the current chairman of the fcc pushing to revoke those  i think entitled to paul szurek so the last time ive actually spoken to a politician or a federal regulator might have been a decade and a half ago so i think that the simple answer is that therere a lot of people working through this however it turns out its probably fine for us either way we didnt see a big change when net neutrality was implemented by the prior fcc chairman and i dont expect well see a big change if that gets unwound in the current or is being unwound in the current administration so i hope thats  that’s as response that i can give to your question lukas hartwich and then another just kind of housekeeping question the new development in la the cost basis looks pretty low  square foot im just curious whats going on there paul szurek well because weve got a lot of core and sell in other system is already in place lukas hartwich is that in incremental capex steve smith yes thats correct thats just in the incremental component and obviously leveraging off of the investment we made several years ago there as well lukas operator thank you this concludes the questionandanswer session id like to turn the floor back over to paul szurek for any closing comments paul szurek i just like to close thanking my colleagues for another good quarter all steven and jeff and i know were very fortunate to have an outstanding team that works hard every day to take the care of our customers and create value for our shareholders and id like to thank all of you that are on this call for your interest in the company and thank you especially to those who asked questions so that we have the opportunity to answer them i hope you all have a great
