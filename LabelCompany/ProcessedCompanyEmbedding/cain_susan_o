please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of quiet by susan cainthe kinds of arguments are factual definition evaluation proposal the kind of argument that quiet contains is a proposal because susan cain presents our extroverted world as a problem for introverts she also speaks of solutions to help and explain introvertskindsummarythroughout quiet susan tells about the life of introverts and many misconceptions that people have about introverts she explains the differences between extroverts and introverts she also clears up the confusion between introversion and just being shy quiet helps to find out more about yourself and why you may react or feel the way you do in certain situations todays society has a bias toward extroverts called the extrovert ideal cain takes a stance against this by enforcing that introverts are not less in comparison to extrovertspurposeaccording to everythings an argument the purposes of arguments include to inform convince explore make decisions and to meditate and pray this novel was an argument to inform susan cain includes numerous facts and plentiful research in the novel to provide readers with littleknown information that clears up misconceptions about introverts and extroverts occasion occasions for arguments include arguments about the past forensic future deliberative  present ceremonial this novel is an argument about thepresent because it takes a stance against our present bias towards extroverts called the extrovert ideal by ariana chiapasteagan fors nicole oyewunmiquiet by susan cainthere are not specific groups that allaudiences fit into in everythingsan argument we believe that the audience was intended to be introverts becausethey can best relate to the information in thenovel susan cain probably wanted to show introverts their true power so that they would go out into the world and change the perspective ofothersthe types of appeals are emotional pathosethical ethos and logical logos quiet would best fit into the category of emotional appeal because it uses details and anecdotes to allow readers to empathize with introvertsthe example used in everythings an argument was that campuses should providemore wheelchair access for students whichrelates to the argument in quiet thatthe world should provide a more acceptingview of introverts text to self we are all introverts andwe connect to the feeling of havingto fake extroversion in order to feel acceptedand intelligent this book shows that it is not necessary or healthy to hide who you really are and taught us strategies of how to use ourpersonalities to our advantage text to text this book connects to outliers because it uses some of the same information butwith different explanations quiet says asians are more successful because of an introverted culture that promotes hard work while in outliers asians are more successful due to hard work alone  text to world many schools across the country usegroup settings in their classrooms and these groups areused in many activities research has shown that thesegroups are not the most productive method yet as western culture spreads more and more schools around the world are adopting this group ideal therefore adopting the extrovert ideal audienceappealconnectionsfull transcriptmore presentations by nicole o development of the us political systemuntitled preziuntitled

productivityenhancing focus and privacy at work by mimi zeiger minute readintroverts of the workplace are having a moment the office furniture company steelcase teamed up with susan cain author of the bestseller quiet the power of introverts in a world that can’t stop talking to create a series of five spaces that address the need for more focus and privacy at workadvertisementthe collection called susan cain quiet spaces comes right in the middle of a longestablished era in which open nonhierarchical workplaces are the norm at any startup private offices and cubicles are increasingly seen as the nostalgic stuff of mad men but everyone knows how frustrating it is to take a phone call that requires privacy or to get serious creative work done amidst the distractions that naturally pop up in an openplan office “in the past we would talk about the benefits of collaboration visibility and the ability to show people work in progress” explains steelcase’s application design manager vanessa bradley “there is a message here about balance” the company grounds its designs in two workplace surveys that looked at privacy and wellbeing of the  north american workers polled in the survey  of

contemporary office and offers a critique “it is an impoverished way of looking at space” she says pointedly “i felt very strongly that there is a whole emotional range of human experience that is not included in the workplace”the five spaces offered by steelcase vary from  to  square feet the larger spaces are collaborative the space names evoke the nature of the experience be me studio mind share
