pleased to announce that tri pointe group recorded another quarter of strong operational and financial performance for the second quarter of  highlighted by a  increase in net new home orders and net income of  million or  per diluted share said tri pointe group chief executive officer doug bauer  we met or exceeded our previously stated guidance for backlog conversion homebuilding gross margin and quarterend community count and put ourselves in a great position to achieve our goals for the back half of the year thanks in part to a  increase in the dollar value of our backlog  these results are a testament to the overall health of the housing market tri pointes strong market positioning and our ongoing commitment to operational excellence second quarter  operating results net income available to common stockholders was  million or  per diluted share in the second quarter of  compared to net income available to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share for the second quarter of   the decrease in net income available to common stockholders was primarily driven by two land transactions in the second quarter of  representing  million in land and lot sales revenue and  million in land and lot gross margin with no comparable transactions in the current year period home sales revenue increased  million or  to  million for the second quarter of  as compared to  million for the second quarter of   the increase was primarily attributable to an  increase in new home deliveries to  offset by a  decrease in average selling price of homes delivered to  compared to

compared to  at june     homebuilding gross margin percentage for the second quarter of  decreased to  compared to  for the second quarter of  however it increased  basis points sequentially from the first quarter of   excluding interest and impairments and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was  for the second quarter of  compared to  for the second quarter of   the decrease in homebuilding gross margin percentage was largely due to the mix of homes delivered in particular a lower portion of homes delivered from our longdated california communities which produce gross margins above the company average selling general and administrative sga expense for the second quarter of  increased to  of home sales revenue as compared to  for the second quarter of  due to the incremental general and administrative costs associated with growing our company  tri pointe continues to be at the forefront of homebuilding with unique home designs and thoughtfully engineered communities that cater to the lifestyles of todays homebuyers said tri pointe group chief operating officer tom mitchell  we have placed an added emphasis on creating living spaces that appeal to two of the biggest buyer segments in the marketplace  millennials and active adults  and our strong performance this quarter is a direct result of these efforts  we believe that our commitment to homebuilding design and innovation gives us a competitive advantage over other production homebuilders and creates longterm value for our stockholders  see

utilize certain financial measures that are nongaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission we present these measures because we believe they and similar measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating the companys operating performance and financing structure we also believe these measures facilitate the comparison of our operating performance and

similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile homebuilding gross margin percentage as reported and prepared in accordance with gaap to the nongaap measure adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage we believe this information is
