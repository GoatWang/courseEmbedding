could do for me i even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them i was able to get  apr until the next year and they also had low transfer rates now that i have been with the company for a long time there is no way i would switch i have also talked to some of my family and friends joining citi and switching from the credit cards that they had they are glad that they did and it is

submitted and is pending editorial review   submit comment  reply by comparecards  jan   hi marty it is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank the reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the citi simplicity is because the att access more credit card is issued by citibank as well but  apr is very high so i would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest two cards to consider that arent issued by citibank would be the chase slate which offers  months with  apr and no balance transfer fee or the discover it which has  months with  apr thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review by mohammed y hussain  jul

 citibank credit card issuance trust cccit became the current issuance vehicle out of the master trust built to incorporate several structural features described below ccimt owns the receivables supporting both ccimt and cccit issuance ccimts securitizations are backed by credit card receivables originated and serviced by citibank na rated moodys a sp a fitch a citibank became seller of receivables to and servicer of the master trust as a result of its merger with citibank south dakota na on july   the eligibility criteria for the receivables that can be sold to the master trust include the following the receivables must be from accounts owned by citibank or an affiliate the cardholders must not have been in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding the receivables must be denominated in us dollars cccit securities are issued in the form of notes governed by new york law cccit issues three classes of securities class a rated aaaaaaaaa class b rated aaaa and class c rated baaabbb classes b and c are subordinated to class a and are part of the credit enhancement structure the issuance of cccit class b and c securities is independent of the issuance of class a securities however class a and class b securities cannot be issued if the required enhancement for that class classes b and c for a class c for b is insufficient following are the salient features of cccit securities please see the applicable prospectus for a full description of the securities mechanics classes issued by cccit are grouped together for the allocation of finance charge receivable cash flows thus there is a single set of monthly cash flows that generates excess spread for all the notes rather than for individual securities this is commonly referred to as a socialized trust structure please refer to the applicable prospectus for the allocation order of finance charge receivables on an ongoing monthly basis the master trust purchases credit card receivables to ensure that the face amount of securities remains outstanding until maturity even though cardholders may pay any amount from the minimum up to the full amount owed principal cash flows are shared across all classes of notes if any one class is set to repay principal but its prorata share of principal cash flows from the underlying credit card receivables is insufficient that class can utilize principal from all other classes that are not likewise needed to repay principal credit enhancement along with excess spread and an early amortization feature support the ratings of each class of security for example credit enhancement levels for cccit class a term notes consist of  of class b notes and  of class c notes expressed as a percentage of class a notes in addition all cccit notes have the benefit of the series  credit card participation certificate issued by ccimt on may   the principal amount of the series  certificate will generally be equal to  of all outstanding cccit notes the total credit enhancement levels for each class of notes are established by moodys standard and poors and fitch and are shown in the structure slide at the top of this page deutsche bank

me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help when i first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me i even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them i was able to get  apr until the next year and they also had low transfer rates now that i have been with the company for a long time there is no way i would switch i have also talked to some of my family and friends joining citi and switching from the credit cards that they had they are glad that they did and it is

submitted and is pending editorial review   submit comment  reply by comparecards  jan   hi marty it is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank the reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the citi simplicity is because the att access more credit card is issued by citibank as well but  apr is very high so i would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest two cards to consider that arent issued by citibank would be the chase slate which offers  months with  apr and no balance transfer fee or the discover it which has  months with  apr thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review by mohammed y hussain  jul

right on point they are always able to answer any questions that i may have unlike other companies out there i have never had a problem with them if i am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help when i first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me i even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them i was able to get  apr until the next year and they also had low transfer rates now that i have been with the company for a long time there is no way i would switch i have also talked to some of my family and friends joining citi and switching from the credit cards that they had they are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now they have also used citi for loans and also personal banking thank you citi reply thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review   submit

editorial review by marty kowal  jan   i have an att card with  interest i tryed to get the citibank simplicity card to transfer the balance but they wont do it reply thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review   submit comment  reply by comparecards  jan   hi marty it is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank the reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the citi simplicity is because the att access more credit card is issued by citibank as well but  apr is very high so i would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest two cards to consider that arent issued by citibank would be the chase slate which offers  months with  apr and no balance transfer fee or the discover it which has  months with  apr thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review by mohammed y hussain  jul   the best card i have is capital visa even though i had very bad credit first they gave me  limits so i build it up to  then they sent me a visa credit application i sent it for the heck of it i received the card from them i was shockthey gave me  limits on this visa card plus if i spent  in my first  month i will get  mile which i already got i really feel that capital one is the best card i
