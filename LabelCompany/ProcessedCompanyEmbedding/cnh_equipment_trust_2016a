increased losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses showing limited impact on the rating of the notes under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage fitch was
