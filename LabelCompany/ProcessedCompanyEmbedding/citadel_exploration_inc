it has already been found four generations the nahabedian family’s legacy in the california oil business was nearly brief and inglorious one it began with william wallace stabler’s venture from the pennsylvania dutch countryside to pursue life as a cowboy in the still wild west which soon led him to the los angeles basin in the early days of the oil boom he immediately took to the oil patch first as a mule skinner loading pipe in la and hauling it to santa paula ca then the epicenter of the oil and gas industry young bill took an interest in a well in lieu of payment for a load of pipe and soon was out of the pipe hauling business and wildcatting himself bill soon expanded his focus to huntington beach and the san joaquin valley site of the lakeview gusher a blowout that had flowed ninemillion barrels of oil into a manmade lake over  months a decade earlier in april of  stabler’s globe petroleum company drilled encyclopedia well  reaching a total depth of  feet the deepest producing oil well in the world at the time flowing at rates in excess of  barrels per day globe’s huntington beach rigs soon dotted the surfside like wildflowers   it was not long thereafter that bill’s daughter katherine met aramis nahabedian a hardnosed entrepreneur in the rubbish business of east los angeles aramis took an immediate interest in his father inlaw’s oil business what he lacked in technical knowledge of the oil business he more than made up for with a tremendous business acumen he learned on the mean streets of los angeles without an education in geology aramis instead adopted the strategy of “closeology” go where oil had been found acquire adjacent land and drill the best place to find oil is where it has already been found bill lived out his days in a cabin near fort tejon hunting and prospecting over his life he was responsible for locating more than two hundred million barrels of oil over the next few decades aramis would befriend and employ many of the men who would one day become premiere oil finders in the state of california some of them continue to work with the family to this very day oil now flowed in the nahabedian family blood aramis and katherine’s son mark nahabedian embarked as the third generation in the oil industry with a more scientific approach he graduated from ucla with a degree in geology and went to work prospecting across the san joaquin sacramento and salinas basins his finds alone would prove to be enough of a legacy for the family with discoveries at landslide panama lane hastings ranch denverton creek and many more mark nahabedian also discovered pastoria creek oilfield in  the last major discovery on the tejon ranch that his grandfather previously had pioneered mark’s discoveries alone account for some two hundred million barrels of equivalent oil for mark’s sons armen vahagn and mark jr the oil patch was the backdrop of childhood recycled maps and well logs were christmas wrapping paper and trips to oilfields were common at a very early age mark educated armen and his brothers in all aspects of the family business as soon as they learned to read and write after high school armen enlisted in the united states marine corps and served in operation iraqi freedom as an infantryman and translator for his platoon he witnessed firsthand the sacrifices that our servicemen have made for both middle east democracy and the oil that supports the economy in the region when he returned from the war armen officially entered the family business the nahabedian exploration group borrowing from his grandfather armen also employed the strategy of closeology embarking on his first lease as an offset to the famous belridge oil field where he drilled and completed his first discovery well which was mapped and interpreted by his father with the momentum of success armen rose quickly through the family business becoming an operations manager then expanding his duties into land acquisition business

the united states navy   why california  citadel exploration we believe the best place to find oil is where it has already been found why california and why kern county in specific kern county is the most prolific oil producing county in the entire united states – more productive even than the famous texas counties of the permian and eagleford basins — pumping out some  barrels in  or about  of california’s total production the reason is simple no region in the entire world has a greater concentration of millionbarrel producing fields than the san joaquin basin – not saudi arabia not the bakken and not texas and with five billionbarrel fields within its borders kern county covers the heart of the basin california eps enjoy the high demand of a large population with an oilthirsty car culture refiners in the golden state simply cannot buy enough local oil in fact california produces just  barrels per day but refiners have more than threetimes that capacity — over  million barrels – a number that barely meets the demand of  million people as evidenced by a recent spike in gasoline process to nearly  a gallon despite the oil price plunge so even with thousands of oil wells pumping away within an hour’s drive of most refineries the majority of california gasoline is refined from oil imported from overseas or other states   the balance comes from alaska  saudi arabia  ecuador  iraq  and mexico  that’s why california oil often attracts a premium of  over west texas intermediate wti pricing depending on market fluctuations in fact california oil prices have more closely mirrored pricing for brent crude the standard world price deck for oil in recent years because of its key geological location kern county’s economy is dominated by the oil industry along side the agriculture industry as a result the county features robust industry infrastructure and a deep bench of service providers supported by an extremely efficient regulatory system that safely and effectively permits new production in a matter of weeks perhaps more importantly kern county is an oasis of regulatory sanity the county government is currently finalizing a countywide environmental impact report eir for the entire industry this will further streamline the local government’s approach to permitting production and greatly reduce paperwork for exploratory drilling the only county in the state to take such an industryfriendly approach this does not in any way mean that kern county standards are unsafe or overly permissive in addition to being the heart of the state’s oil industry the county is also the heart of the san joaquin valley one of the most productive agriculture regions in the world in fact oil production is often located inside agricultural operations and the two are mutually supportive produced water from oil operations is cleaned and sold to farmers while walnut shells and other agriculture byproducts play a role in oil production kern county’s forwardthinking realistic approach to oil industry regulation ensures that both opportunities are safely and effectively maximized technical innovations are derisking inaccessible oil and revealing hidden prospects older fields and field extensions represent low hanging fruit as technology and higher commodity prices allow the industry to unlock previously uneconomic zones reprocessing of vintage seismic data combined with new highresolution d seismic is highlighting previously unnoticed oil – often adjacent to or under legacy wells the comingling of multiple hydrocarbon bearing zones is making wells more economical as are horizontal drilling techniques being applied to conventional targets and most impactful to coil advances in thermal recovery coupled with record low natural gas prices are making it economically feasible to recover significant quantities of oil untouched by previous production major oil companies like chevron exxon and shell never left their california operations while others like occidental petroleum’s california resource corporation spinoff are refocusing in the region that means there are few “ground floor” opportunities in smallcap ep space – and zero with four generations of experience in california oil these opportunities will bear fruit in the near future via robust oil production as this trend is identified by both investors and independent ep companies an eventual exit strategy should present itself and kern county will be at the heart of the action   to get the wti oil price please enable javascript to get the brent oil
