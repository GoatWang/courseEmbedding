the place of product design and aesthetics research in consumer research the paper begins by discussing design and aesthetics and provides some background concerning the study of these topics the efforts of consumer researchers in these areas and the unique suitability of the discipline of consumer research for studying product design and aesthetics are then discussed finally recommendations are presented concerning the significant research questions and issues that need to be addressed if this area is to become a viable stream in consumer research introduction there is a growing recognition that product design is emerging as a key marketing element kotler and rath  holbrook and zirlin  wallendorf  this is especially true of the portions of product design that involve construction for human interaction and aesthetics design which refers to the organization of elements of an object and aesthetics are inherently linked since the design or physical form of a product encompasses aesthetic aspects of the product eg shape color texture etc the importance of product design as a determinant of consumer behavior is increasing as the technology gaps between companies become smaller and companies are able to produce products that are similar with respect to features quality and costs ie price despite the growing awareness of the influence that product design can have on product preferences surprisingly little in the way of design or aesthetic theory has been advanced that aids in our understanding of how people respond to design or how aesthetic responses are formed berlyne  p  gorski  p  disciplines such as industrial product design the phrase industrial design which is a holdover from the days of the industrial revolution has served to obscure the profession charges with shaping most of the products that are produced and sold industrial designers eg henry dreyfuss raymond loewy etc are concerned with enhancing the appearance of manufactured products as well as improving their utility are looking to the psychological sciences to address the lack of design theory gorski  the progress of consumer researchers in this area has been limited and sporadic as a result of the absence of theory there continues to be a great deal of unease when it comes to making decisions about design and managing design projects this is particularly problematic for managers charged with transferring new technology out of the laboratory and into the market it is at this point that design and aesthetics play a crucial role in communicating a products identity and use to consumers design and aesthetics the term design may be used to refer to a process or to a particular product composition for the development of consumer and industrial products this process typically involves collaboration among industrial product designers engineers marketing experts scientists technicians as well as others izzi and caplan  the objective of the design process is to produce a product design design as it is used to refer to a particular product configuration ie arrangement of elements or parts may be viewed as involving a number of important considerations a successful ie good optimal design is one that performs its intended functions well is economical ie profitable for the manufacturer and a good value for the consumer and is pleasant to behold in addition product design ie configuration plays a crucial role in communicating a products use ie function and operating procedure to the consumer eg norman  the ability of a design to communicate a products function and use to the consumer through its form is paramount since part of the role of a products design is to interpret technology this facet of design is growing in importance as the products that we interact with on a daily basis are increasingly becoming more complex thus from a functional or operational point of view a key design issue is how to structure a product so as to promote or maximize product interpretation understanding and use eg performance safety product design ie industrial design is perhaps most associated with aesthetic considerations bel geddes  pp  while aesthetic considerations eg shape symmetry texture etc usually pertain to the external surfaces which house or protect the inner workings eg mechanical or electrical components of a product these considerations are not entirely independent of other design concerns for example aesthetic considerations are influenced by product structure ie mechanisms and components that allow the product to perform a particular function this is especially true of designs that strive to communicate the function of a product rather than to conceal it in such cases many elements of a product design that are thought of as being aesthetic eg shape are in fact frequently the principal means by which the purpose and use of the object are communicated this is particularly true today since computer chip technology has freed many products from having to assume forms determined by the larger mechanical components used in the past thus aesthetic considerations in product design can be quite complex and broad in scope since aesthetics ie form configuration often plays a central role in object perception recognition interpretation understanding and use product aesthetics ie design can exert a significant influence on consumer behavior eg veryzer  enhanced product appearance can certainly be advantageous in a commercial sense even for utilitarian products although product aesthetics is central to product design it is this facet that is least well understood despite the relatively long duration of aesthetics study in disciplines such as philosophy art criticism art history psychology anthropology experimental aesthetics industrial design and more recently consumer research there has been a striking inability to formulate a coherent theory with respect to the aesthetic aspect of design progress in this area has been inhibited by two unresolved issues that are fundamental to aesthetics research the first issue concerns the locus of aesthetic experience the crucial question is whether aesthetic experience emanates from the object or is generated by the perceiver of the object this issue is apparent in a number of ongoing debates such as whether or not beauty is governed by rules and whether or not aesthetic response is subjective a second issue concerns the nature of the aesthetic value of an object some aestheticians eg bullough  pp  maintain that aesthetic objects belong to a special class of objects consisting chiefly of works of fine art and natural phenomena eg the human body landscapes furthermore it is often held that aesthetic appreciation ie experience can only take place when the object is viewed without attention to any practical or utilitarian consideration eg bullough  this view which has resulted in a philosophy of art definition being associated with the term aesthetics is divergent from the classical roots of aesthetics eg plato the republic as well as the view of aestheticians who hold a wider conception of aesthetics eg berlyne  p even though design and aesthetics have been studied for quite some time there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty and ambiguity concerning them this is due primarily to the absence of theory which encourages the impression that good design is a rather arbitrary affair finn  while the personcproduct relationship which is design is a complex one it is likely to seem less arbitrary as we learn to better identify and differentiate its essential parts and the factors that influence responses to it product design and aesthetics in consumer research since design and aesthetics are potentially important factors in the selection of many if not most products it is not surprising that consumer researchers have found them worthwhile to study consumer researchers have tended to focus on the aesthetic aspect of product design this is not surprising since this is a central concern of design and most personcproduct relationships ie interactions begin with the perception of a products appearance izzi and caplan  beginning with some early explorations in the mids and early s eg holbrook  olson  sewall  wallendorf  a slender stream of research in consumer aesthetics began to flow holbrook and zirlin  p  consumer researchers began to grapple with some of the significant questions concerning aesthetic responses such as what is an aesthetic response and how are aesthetic responses formed eg holbrook  olson  much of this early work was concerned with determining what the aesthetic aspect of consumption is and how aesthetic phenomena could be researched consumer researchers debated the definition and scope of consumer aesthetics  with some in the field preferring to apply aesthetic experience only to so called artistic or cultural products holbrook  while others acknowledged that virtually any product has an aesthetic component holbrook and zirlin  olson  although this latter view which is consistent with an industrial design perspective seems to have gained general acceptance among consumer researchers the tendencies to associate aesthetics with art and emotion to discount its systematic influence and to discuss aesthetic objects are still present within the consumer research discipline even though the aesthetic aspect of product design has been introduced into the field of consumer research our understanding of the phenomenon has not advanced much beyond that which we inherited from other disciplines there are a number of reasons that the discipline of consumer research has not made more progress in the areas of product design and aesthetics perhaps the most important reasons for the slow rate of progress are that the relevance of product design for consumer research and designs applicability to a broad range of products have been largely overlooked part of the reason for this may be due to conceptions of design and aesthetics as being essentially superficial styling or as pertaining primarily to works of art such views cast the influence and scope of design and aesthetics in very narrow terms this tends to minimize designs importance ie relevance to most product purchase situations and obscure its relationship to other areas that are of interest to consumer researchers eg attitude involvement diffusion of innovations etc many of the obstacles that have limited consumer researchers progress in the areas of design and aesthetics are the same fundamental issues that have impeded researchers in other disciplines that have studied these topics the fundamental design issue concerns how to best configure a product this issue is extremely complex because peoples interactions with product designs involve multiple design considerations eg function communicationinterpretation aesthetics that affect a number of different reactions eg understanding aesthetic response to the product design issues such as the locus of aesthetic experience and the nature of an aesthetic object ie what constitutes an aesthetic object continue to stir debate and cloud aesthetic research holbrook and zirlin  these fundamental issues must be addressed if design and aesthetics research is to become a viable stream in consumer research although there are a number of obstacles that must be overcome there is perhaps no discipline more ideally suited for the study of product design than that of consumer research this discipline offers the unique combination of scientific research methods and a tangible research context ie marketing consumerproduct focus the consumerproduct context as opposed to an art context is extremely helpful for investigating design and aesthetics questions because it allows philosophical questions to be recast in a more concrete form this can be done because successful or good design in a marketing context is more easily defined ie more objective than it is in an art context this is not to say that good design should be defined solely in terms of success in the marketplace or that it will always result in high sales or increased market share rather this context provides a means for assessing the effects of a design because they are manifest in observable behavior eg product purchase which is not shrouded in the subtleties of artistic appreciation consumer research offers a more direct concrete context in which to investigate the influence of design and the factors that underlie peoples responses to it eg cultural influences psychological influences visual organization principles etc if consumer researchers are to make a genuine contribution to our understanding of design and aesthetics beyond those made by other disciplines the unique research context that our field offers must be embraced this means that the applied consumerproduct context of consumer research must be evident in the view of design that the discipline adopts and the products on which it focuses recommendations for consumer research in order for design and aesthetics research to progress researchers must address the fundamental issues that have inhibited the development of theory moreover consumer researchers need to develop new ways of thinking about design and aesthetics that reflect an applied consumerproduct context it is important for consumer researchers to adopt a conceptualization of design that acknowledges the different aspects of product design ie functional communicative and aesthetic and the relationships and tradeoffs among them these aspects represent different roles that the design of a product can play the roles are the different but often interrelated bases for the interaction between person and object ie consumer and product the various aspects of product design play a vital role in the interaction between consumer and product and thus may affect consumer behavior eg comprehension categorization aesthetic response preference choice useperformance etc in addition to adopting a conceptualization that reflects the various roles that design plays in a consumer behavior context a more complete understanding of each design aspect is needed the functional aspect of product design would seem to be relatively straight forward this aspect of a products design is often thought to fall almost entirely within the domain of engineering design however when considered in terms of the consumercproduct interaction a broader view of the functional aspect of design emerges for example a screwdriver may be used to turn screws or pry things open shoes may be worn on feet or used to hammer tacks into a wall an objects form or configuration determines what one can use the object to do this view of the functional aspect of design raises some interesting questions concerning design to guard against product misuse as well as other safety issues while there is a certain truth to the maxim form follows function this saying tends to obscure the fact that function follows ie is determined by form the formfunction distinction is somewhat misleading because the form ie configuration of a product determines both how the product looks ie aesthetics and how it might be used ie function the communicative aspect or role of design eg product semantics needs to be explicitly differentiated from other design considerations and studied this aspect involves visual and iconic cues that help people to interpret what an object does and how it is operated or used eg the environmental controls in most recent automobiles use the color red to indicate warm air and blue to indicate cool air the ability of a product design to effectively communicate its function and how it may be properly operated can greatly facilitate successful personcproduct interaction thus the communicative aspect of design may affect how consumers perceive and categorize a product eg product class complexity leveltechnological sophistication influence their attitude toward its use eg difficult to use and shape their perception of the risks involved in purchasing the product eg afraid they will never use it because it is too difficult to figure out design which makes a product more intelligible assists interpretation and enhances personcproduct interaction ultimately the communicative aspect of a design can make a product easier to use and thereby increase the utility of the product progress in the area of the aesthetic aspect of design will depend on consumer researchers willingness to adopt maintain a more practical view of aesthetics than has been adopted by other disciplines except industrial design the view of aesthetics as pertaining only to art objects is too limited for consumer aesthetics and as was pointed out earlier is not completely true to the classical roots of aesthetic inquiry eg plato the republic consumer researchers should embrace a more inclusive view of aesthetic experience an aesthetic response has been defined as a response arising from the interaction between an objects appearance ie characteristics and configuration and the perceiver of the object berlyne  veryzer  this definition reflects a visual orientation but may be adapted to reflect other orientations eg auditory tactile etc this definition allows for the possibility that virtually any product can be appreciated in an aesthetic sense berlyne  wallendorf  although this definition recognizes that all product designs involve an aesthetic component is does not suggest that aesthetic response plays a significant role in the purchase of every product another feature of this definition is that it clearly acknowledges the interaction between the perceiver and the object ie product in the formation of an aesthetic response consumer researchers must also address questions concerning a products nature ie aesthetic vs utilitarian distinctions are often made between aesthetic and utilitarian objects eg holbrook  holbrook and zirlin  clear distinctions such as these can be difficult to make because all objects have an aesthetic component in that they have a physical form or appearance that can be perceived and thus give rise to an aesthetic response berlyne  p  holbrook and zirlin  wallendorf  likewise one can argue that every object even art objects may serve a utilitarian purpose or function eg plays music novels and movies can be used to entertain paintings and sculpture can be used to establish a mood in a living or work space furthermore distinctions concerning the aestheticness ie aesthetic or utilitarian nature of an object imply that aesthetic experience emanates from the object while the aesthetic vs utilitarian distinction may possibly be made with respect to how a particular object is viewed or used ie consumed by a particular person on a particular occasion such a distinction is person and situation specific ie dependent for example consider the use of utilitarian objects such as railroad paraphernalia eg lanterns railroad track railroad cars crossing gates etc to decorate the interior of a restaurant in such instances there is an inversion of a products apparent nature from utilitarian to aesthetic because of circumstances particular to the perceiver or as in this case the situation thus the aesthetic vs utilitarian distinction is not intrinsic to an object although some objects may be more likely to be appreciated primarily in either an aesthetic or utilitarian sense within the context of a particular culture ie situation how the object is ultimately perceived is determined in large measure by the perceiver and the underlying factors that affect his or her perception eg culture psychological characteristics etc a more useful way of classifying products may be to focus on the aesthetic andor utilitarian intention ie the purpose or aim of the interest in the object of the perceiver this approach acknowledges the role of the perceiver as well as the situational factors in determining the nature aesthetic or utilitarian of an object for example an antique clock could potentially be appreciated for primarily aesthetic or utilitarian reasons the degree to which it is appreciated for either one or both of these things is not fixed by the object eg clock itself but rather can vary depending on the intention ie reason for examining the object of the perceiver of the object on a particular occasion clearly there may be factors such as culture or situation specific influences eg peer group economic circumstances that encourage a tendency to appreciate a product in a particular manner ie aesthetic or utilitarian thus to some degree intention may be fixed ie determined by factors external to the product eg in one culture a play may be a way of imparting history or values while in another culture the play may be viewed as entertainment another way of looking at products involves the sentient nature of a response to an object sentientality refers to the degree to which the design of a product consistently promotes a particular sensation or feeling eg aesthetic response across perceivers of the product sentientality is concerned with the consistency of the response to the product rather than whether the response is positive or negative therefore highsentientality can refer to either a consistently positive or consistently negative or consistently neutral response in the case of products exhibiting highsentientality it is likely that the consistent ie systematic response is due to underlying factors that consciously or unconsciously influence peoples reactions to the object eg visual organization principles  unity proportion etc see veryzer  for a discussion of the design principle algorithm explanation of aesthetic response products that do not foster consistent responses across perceivers can be said to exhibit lowsentientality in such cases responses to product design are likely to reflect primarily idiosyncratic influences eg person specific experiences sentientality acknowledges the role of the product in forming responses to design however it is likely to be dependent in part on things such as internalized visual organization principles and prevalent aesthetic associations ie association between an element or characteristic of an object and a previously encountered object or situation that the perceiver has developed thus the sentientality exhibited by a product is not necessarily intrinsic to the product itself eg products that display the colors associated with a particular school may be prized in the region near the school but treated indifferently outside of that region figure  product design disposition grid these two dimensions ie continuums perceiver intention and product sentientality can be combined to form a grid that can be used to classify products according to the perceivers intention toward the product ie aesthetic andor utilitarian interest and the degree to which the product fosters a systematic response when perceived in figure  the four panels of the grid represent different product natures or dispositions with respect to consumer response to product design a consumers response may reflect a utilitarian or aesthetic intention or possibly both for products where the perceivers current intention is utilitarian the response would involve a reaction to the products abilities or suitability to perform a given task eg frustration because a product is difficult to operate for products where the perceivers current intention involved aesthetic appreciation the reaction would be an aesthetic response in cases where the perceivers intention concerns both utilitarian and aesthetic appreciation both types of responses would be involved sentientality refers to the consistency of these intentionbased responses that is the degree to which a product promotes a consistent response with respect to aesthetic andor utilitarianbased responses for example consumers may consistently appreciate the accuracy of a particular digital wristwatch in keeping time ie highsentientality of utilitarianbased intention however consumers may have a wide variety of reactions to the watchs appearance ie lowsentientality of aestheticbased intention in the event forces external to the product shift the disposition of the product may change eg new technology could make the watch obsolete a backtobasics trend could lead consumers to view the hightech look of digital watches negatively the product design disposition grid is one approach to understanding product responses to design and the mutable nature of products the approach acknowledges the roles of both the product and the perceiver in forming a response to a product design an approach such as this would seem to offer a perspective that is less problematic with respect to the changeable nature of products than the traditional aesthetic vs utilitarian distinction in addition to the areas that relate directly to the fundamental issues of design and aesthetics there are a number of other important research questions that need to be investigated more research is needed to identify factors that influence peoples responses to product designs eg psychological factors culture socioeconomic factors gender visual organization principles prototypicality etc another area that requires further study concerns the relationship between product disposition and fashion cycles changes in product preference patterns suggest that a disruption or shift in a products sentientality may have occurred a better understanding of the process by which such shifts occur could lead to a more complete understanding of fashion as it pertains to product design the development of methods for studying the consumercproduct interaction should also receive more attention ultimately methods are needed that can guide decisions concerning product configuration finally the relationships between design and other streams in consumer research need to be explored the often subtle and unconscious influence of design and aesthetics on consumers product perceptions may have an indirect affect on a broad range of behaviors design and aesthetics may be a factor in areas of interest to consumer researchers such as attitude formation brand choice categorization involvement symbolic consumption etc conclusion design is an important variable that can have a significant impact on consumers responses to products as such it is a legitimate marketing interest that merits the attention of consumer researchers the discipline of consumer research is well suited for studying product design and aesthetics because of its research methods and its applied consumerproduct context the ability to make new and meaningful contributions to our knowledge of design and aesthetics will depend on utilization of this context in order to address the issues that continue to inhibit progress in these areas if this stream is to become viable the ambiguities surrounding conceptions of design and aesthetics as well as the questions concerning the products suitable for study must be addressed although the discipline of consumer research has not rushed to investigate or embrace the study of design and aesthetics it has in the past clearly shown that it is open to exploring areas such as these however the burden falls as it should on the researchers investigating these topics to demonstrate that design and aesthetic considerations are important and relevant to consumer research in order to do this consumer researchers must be willing to approach design and aesthetics from their own perspective and formulate new ways of thinking about these topics that reflect the unique perspective of the
