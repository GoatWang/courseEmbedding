press hits  misses contact us proxy services credit rating definitions longterm credit ratings credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation nature of and provisions of the obligation protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition aaa an obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by eganjoness the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa an obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a an obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb an obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation bb b ccc cc and c obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccc an obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc an obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment c a subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated c is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment the c rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken but payments on this obligation are being continued a c also will be assigned to a preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments but that is currently paying d an obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless eganjoness believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus  or minus  sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nr this indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that eganjoness does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy   ejr derives its watch assignments from the difference between the current and projected ratings no difference between the two results in a stable watch a higher projected rating results in a positive or pos watch and a lower projected rating results in a negative or neg watch the absence of a projected rating results in a developing or dev watch the addition of a pos or neg is at the discretion of the analyst or rating committee and usually results from the direction the rate is expected to move over time   shortterm credit ratings a a shortterm obligation rated a is rated in the highest category by eganjoness the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong within this category certain obligations are designated with a plus sign  this indicates that the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong a a shortterm obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory a a shortterm obligation rated a exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics ratings of b b and b may be assigned to indicate finer distinctions within the b category the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation however it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics but the obligor has a relatively stronger capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics and the obligor has an average speculativegrade capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors b a shortterm obligation rated b is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics and the obligor has a relatively weaker capacity to meet its financial commitments over the shortterm compared to other speculativegrade obligors c a shortterm obligation rated c is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation d a shortterm obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless eganjoness believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will
