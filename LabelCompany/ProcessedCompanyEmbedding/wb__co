co wild bunch  co interview cofounder mark walker photographed on abuying trip to nishiki food market kyoto fabulous food conceptsinterview with mark walker from the book fabulous food concepts published by luster books and available to buy on amazon introductionmuch sooner than planned mark walker hit wallpaper magazine with his brand new vegetable juice brand wild bunch juices and business broke loose two years before while working in the advertising industry in london and new york mark suffered from a medical condition which meant he had to change his diet “nothing serious but i was obliged to make certain adjustments one was that i  could no longer drink fruit juice because it has too much natural sugar therefore i had to switch to vegetable juice and i soon discovered that unfortunately there was not so much choice available for vegetable juice as there was for fruit juice”he researched the best way to make vegetable juice detected some old european techniques and developed a machine to make beetroot and carrot juice for himself and his partner he was quite happy with the results but never intended to market ithowever he did not count on the wordofmouth promotion that got into its stridebefore he knew he was delivering pure organic coldpressed vegetable juices not only to family but also to friends and friends of friendsmid  mark launched wild bunch juices in singapore because of ambitious plans to make vegetable products the name was gradually rebaptised into wbco or wild bunch  co soups biscuits and even vegetable skin care products are on the programme in  wild bunch  co entered the uk market the line is currently sold at waitrose daylesford organic selfridges and other “leading” retailers can you tell me more about how things went concretely from production for personal use to business some time after i started making the juices for myself my motherinlaw got cancer she recovered but while she was in remission she was too weak to eat her body’ could not digest food so she could not take in the energy and nutrients she needed ‘therefore i began makingvegetablejuice for her it did her uell she told her doctor about it he told other patients and soon we began receiving requests from diabetics people with cancer and people on restricted diets in the beginning it was kindness it was among friends but after a while the urge to deal with more properly grew our first mission was how to help people on restricted diets to get strongerand then it grew from there to targeting other people as well people who want to live a healthy live that became our second and off course main customer groupcan people get cured when they drink the juicesno i do want to stress that this is a complementary therapy we are not going around telling people it is a treatment or a cure but as everybody knows eating or drinking vegetables does help a big deal to build resistance plenty of raw fresh organic vegetables in your diet are an insurance policy that can guard against future diseases as the vitamins minerals and phytonutrients speed up the action of the body’s natural detoxification process that is the whole genesis of the company it began from providing people the nutritional benefits of organic vegetable juice the reason why that is important today is because it is still part of our business it also means that everything we make is completely natural because cancer patients cannot take any toxins into their bodies so there are no additives no pasteurisation and no preservatives other vegetable juice brands can sit on the shelf for more than a year wbco is absolutely pure organic juicethe name speaks for itself why did you change it into wbcothe idea for the name came from us we did not go through large brainstorms it was a simple process it is a simple and fun name not abstract it is organic so it is wild the name connects with people easily also with those on a restricted diet when people are ill they do not want to be reminded of that and they certainly do not want to be approached with more latin names we changed the name of our company to wbco because of two different reasons we want to provide our customers with new vegetable products other than juice and we were also planning to go oversees so we needed an even more international namewhat is the company mission today“offer vegetable products in exciting and innovative ways vegetables are not appreciated the way they should we want to make the use of vegetables more convenient so it becomes part of people’s daily lives we are what we eat but people need to accept that concept and then they will realise that vegetables are an important part of the quality of your life”can you tell me more about the production of the juices“we daily produce pure organic coldpressed vegetable juice each morning the juice goes from our wbco pressing plant in london straight into the stores the juice is a hundred percent organic the organic veggies and herbs we use are sourced locally and are certified as organic at source our current range includes carrot  ginger organic beetroot carrot  celery and organic spinach carrot  parsley the absolute profit with organic vegetables is that they can contain up to forty percent more vitamins and minerals than nonorganic and that they are naturally sweet to taste as they contain less water”you first opened a wbco shop in singapore while you were in england why singapore“we indeed launched the wild bunch shop bar in singapore just to put the product the product down to market we had an idea but there was no real business model to a degree it was uncharted territory and that is why we started singapore a good thing about singapore is that it is small and ideal ti test a new product to see what people buy and what they reject in singapore you get a sample of what may happen somewhere else because it consists of such a cross section of people soon alter the shop was opened wallpaper ran an article on us and we got an awful lot of response we actually did not plan that because we were in a stage where we still wanted to learn before sending out press releases or hyping the brand up business boomed faster than we planned”the wbco bottles are like little design pieces who took care of the design“one thing i knew for sure i did not want dancing or jumping carrots on the bottles the bottles had to be simple beautiful and stylish but most of all different from other brands in that category so we searched for inspiration in another sector the one of cosmetics and more specifically perfumes that is where the shape of the bottle comes from it is quite organic and it has balance it is really all about communicating the respect for the product and the concept the design is a perfect reflection of our quality seed singapore designed the logo and the bottledo you spend a lot on marketing and communications“our product range is not mainstream when we are talking to our customers who have severe illnesses there are even restrictions to what we can say so we do not actively target those people we mainly reach them through wordofmouth and when we talk at conferences it is a very distinct market and will represent in the long term probably no more than  of our businesswith the second customer group the majority we can communicate through our retail channels we work with stores who cater to our customers to this end much of the our advertising and promotion is driven by instore marketingwbco is organic but are you all the way greenin my opinion no company who manufactures and distributes on any reasonable scale can claim to be “all the way green” like many companies we work within the waste management infrastructure of the local authority in our case london and try to combine this with our company’s own initiatives in regard to these initiatives we refill and reuse approximately  of our glass bottles in addition to this all the pulp the part of the vegetable leftover from juicing is delivered to the royal parks in london hyde park kensington etc and used as organic compost sustainable initiatives are never the product of one company if retailers did not make the effort to collect the glass bottles these ideas would never workwhat is your view on sustainabilityfor wbco the biggest challenge facing the food industry is food waste this is not typically seen as a sustainable issue but it is billions of pounds of food is wasted in the uk and throughout the world each year this impacts every part of the supply chain and is a contributing factor to the current high cost of food when we begin to reduce food waste — then we will know that people are starting to value what they are buying and when they do this all the other sustainable issues such as primary and secondary packaging etc will reduce this is what wbco will be campaigning for in the futurewhat do you dream of for wbco“most of all i dream of making vegetable organic products available to as many people as possible hopefully we will be able to create enough awareness so people understand why vegetables are so good for them our mission is to make vegetables exciting” written by mr sigrid vandensavelluster publishing  wb construction products home about us products sealants waterproofing concrete  masonry air barrier architectural panels accessories
