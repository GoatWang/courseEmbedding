says that is fractional for what the average customer pays for checking at the bank where one bounced check or overdraft costs you far more —  a lot of the time i know many people use big banks and never pay a fee but my average customer is a single mom with a couple of kids trying to make ends meet people like that are never going to have that  minimum balance just hanging out there at all times to avoid the monthly charge at the bank and at green dot you cant overdraft avoid confusion i like easy things basic things even back in radio i liked that i would launch a station with a new

information appears in todays press release the content of this call is property of the green dot corporation and is subject to copyright protection now id like to turn the call over to steve steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you dara and welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call im pleased to report that q was another strong quarter for green dot delivering results ahead of our expectations on both the top and bottomline total gaap operating revenue came it at  million versus our expectation of  million adjusted ebitda including  million of unusual and incremental launch expenses associated with the rollout of our new suite of prepaid products was  million versus our expectation of  million nongaap eps including those incremental launch expenses were  versus our expectation of  revenue growth came from all our product lines across the company including prepaid cards gobank checking accounts cash transfers and tax refund processing but without question the big story of the quarter is the acceleration of our core prepaid card business where per active card metrics accelerated to new highs across most of the kpis we track for example on a yearoveryear basis average revenue per active card was up  purchase volume per active was up  interchange revenue per active card was up  direct deposit penetration was up  and total gdv per active card was up  the number of reloads or cash transfers per active card was up  and the revenue we earn on each of those transactions was up  a good high level way to think of it is that even though our active card base was down  yearoveryear the revenue from the account services segment was up slightly which we believe is a pretty amazing statistic and indicative that the improvement and features weve deployed to our suite of new and existing products is helping to drive engagement and usage of our products we believe we are doing a better job of pleasing our customers as you know weve laid out a sixstep plan to drive growth and deliver at least  in nongaap eps in  and id like to update you on each of those initiatives and those steps and discuss how they contributed to our performance during the second quarter step one on our sixstep plan is to launch new more appealing products with materially better unit economics at all  retailers so on this step which is our card business the key headline for the quarter is at both our new card products and our legacy card products are contributing unit economics at historic highs our overall portfolio is a blend of all the new cards so over time our portfolio shifts towards more new cards with the new economics but today the portfolio still dominated by the old cards that why its important to note that both old cards and new cards performed strongly in q across the portfolio average revenue per active was up  as i mentioned earlier we believe the stronger revenue per active card is the result of a few changes weve made to our business over the past few years first as you know we discontinued our old moneypak product in february of  this change made our products less attractive to certain segments of customers who used moneypak to reload their cards with cash it also so happened that the segment of customers who relied on moneypak were mostly lower revenue generating customers and included many oneanddone customers where we made little money as such in the last  months we believe we lost approximately  mostly lowvalue active accounts as a result of these changes our legacy card portfolio now contains a larger share of higherrevenue generating committed customers who are generating substantially higher revenue per active card in terms of our new suite of cards theyve been on sale at walmart since late q on a full chain basis and most other green dot brand retailers since early q the new products are enjoying very strong customer usage metrics like firsttime reloading spend and gdv most importantly as a result of the strong customer usage metrics and the materially better unit economics theyre generating high revenue per new card sold of course prepaid cards just like other types of subscription businesses take time to mature as a portfolio so we dont yet have enough historical data to know precisely how the portfolio of new cards will look with age but so far signs are very encouraging as you can tell in part from our results in q as mentioned earlier one trend were observing is that the new cards seem to attract fewer oneanddone buyers our cards are still far and away the bestsellers on the rack but we seem to have peeled away some of the repeat oneanddone users that used to generate a lot of unit sales but not a lot of revenue and sometimes even negative margins on that revenue so the cards were selling today seem to be higher revenue producing and made up of more committed customers another benefit of increasing revenue per active card is margin expansion incremental revenue on an active card drops to the bottom line at a very high contribution margin since the costs of supporting an active card are essentially the same regardless of the revenue that the card generates this is one of the reasons why were continuing to see margin expansion on a yearoveryear basis after adjusting for the unusual launch expense of  million in the quarter and normalizing for the higher walmart rev share increases which did not lap until may this is the trend we expect to continue as we work to drive increasing customer usage and increasing revenue per active card on top of an increasingly more efficient operating platform so the summary here is that between the greatly improving revenuegenerating characteristics of our legacy portfolio and the superior unit economics of our new card products we are benefiting from material yearoveryear organic growth in our prepaid card business lines remember that to stay flat for the year we estimated we would need to generate an additional  million in revenue to make up for the moneypak related losses the fact that were actually up yearoveryear in revenue is an indication that were on track with our expectations now lets discuss the second step in our sixstep plan and thats bringing back moneypak with new risk controls to recap several years ago green dot and others with similar reload products saw dramatic rise in nefarious use of those products we were unable to impede the fraud at that time so we took the difficult step of removing moneypak from store shelves concurrently weve rolled out a new easier and more fraud resistant method of reloading cards called reload  the register which as the name implies allows the customer to reload their card with a simple swipe of the card at the register as you can tell from our reload volumes this service has caught on quite well with consumers and its now the standard by which how prepaid cards are reloaded throughout our industry meanwhile we were hard at work designing a new moneypak equipped with new antifraud technology so that we could one day bring back the popular moneypak product the culmination of those efforts was that the new moneypak which rolled out to retailers in april and its currently on sale at around  green dot retailers including walgreens rite aid and kroger the product is selling within our expectations with volumes growing monthovermonth we also expect to gain additional distribution at other major green dot retailers including cvs who will start selling moneypak later this year of course the new moneypak may never be as a big as the old moneypak given that many customers have switched to green dots reload  the register service and other customers have moved on to other replacement products and now satisfy their needs but we think it will be a nice contributor over time for the segment of customers who use moneypak for putting cash on prepaid cards and various other noncard related use cases step three in our sixstep plan is to make modest investments in high potential initiatives that aligned with our roadmap to growth id like to touch on one or two of those initiatives to give you a sense of where we stand and what were seeing first lets talk about lending we believe there is an enormous unmet need within our customer base for well designed and fairly priced credit products at the same time its not easy frankly to lend profitably to the consumers we serve as a result were entering the lending marketplace deliberately but carefully through two complementary paths one is called green dot money which is our lending marketplace the other is our launch of a secured credit card and ill tell you about both green dot money lets us partner with others to bring credit to our customers without taking the credit risk ourselves our secured credit card lets us lend directly to our customers while managing credit risk by tying the customers credit line to a security deposit held at green dot bank green dot money is up and running the good news is that the application volume is good and growing substantially monthovermonth validating our belief about unmet need the bad news is that approval rates for the marketplace lenders are far too low to make the marketplace perform the way we want the inherent challenge of lending to consumers with low or no credit scores has been exacerbated by the recent upheaval in the alternative lending market some lenders have restricted the number of loans theyre making and others have tightened underwriting standards both of which limit approvals at the lowend of the fico spectrum which is where our customers generally rate we are working with our marketplace lenders to provide them with better incremental underwriting data that might be able to help them say yes more often and it will continue to explore how green dot money can help us serve our customers and grow our business in terms of our secured credit card we plan to launch that product by late q and well offer it to applicants who have an interest in approving their credit scores for both green dot money and our secured card program we have been disciplined on the scope in how we design these products and weve kept investments low our technology expense to build the green dot money site was quite modest and our cost of customer acquisition is essentially zero as a result we have little downside and we believe lots of potential upside as we work to build this business over the medium to longterm the other growth initiatives id like to discuss is our uber  payroll account that we developed to focus on what were now calling the gig economy the theory underlying this initiative is pretty simple as more and more americans leave the w economy and join the  economy the gig economy the ondemand economy we believe we can meaningfully expand our customer base by putting green dot in the flow making us a natural choice for consumers and small business owners that need a checking account ubers a test case for this thesis when drivers enroll with uber they are offered the chance to open a gobank checking account since the program launched on a national basis just a few months ago uber debit by gobank has registered over  drivers and advanced over  million in wages to gobank account more recently weve worked with uber to make green dot an even more compelling option by introducing a new product called instant pay to any debit drivers use instant pay pay a small fee and in return green dot bank advances their wages ride by ride and in near realtime to just about any domestic bank issue debit card we make money by sharing of the transaction fee charged to the driver instant pay which launched just a few weeks ago is experiencing terrific growth on a weekoverweek basis and weve already completed over  instant pay transactions to drivers in just a short amount of time were proud of what were doing for uber drivers but whats really notable is how the program demonstrates the opportunity to use green dots unique assets to win business over the past few years weve made substantial investments in cuttingedge financial technology and mobile ux capabilities at the same time we own a bank and maintain a strong balance sheet there are lots of banks out there but very few banks that are silicon valley fintech and mobile leaders we believe that weve created a unique platform we can now use to drive longterm growth by extending our reach to new modern use cases and new distribution channels in addition to our profitable core legacy channels step four in our sixstep plan is to launch major platform initiatives that are intended to drive significant cost reductions this year and next weve made solid progress so far and with the exception of some new unknowns related to the processor migration project which is part of this savings initiative we feel good about our progress todate step five in our sixstep plan is to make opportunistic and accretive acquisitions using cash or debt its hard to find high quality acquisitions that are accretive and digestible but were always on the lookout for deals that could be strategically and financially compelling step six in our sixstep plan is to execute on our  million share repurchase plan as you know we still have made  million in buyback so far since we announced our threeyear plan in late  we still have  million of buybacks remaining in the authorization which we expect to execute in due course in addition to the share buybacks were also actively seeking opportunities to improve returns from green dot bank when we bought the bank our regulators imposed very strict limits on us given that we were new bank operator but now as we hit the fiveyear anniversary of owning green dot bank were working with our regulators to give us greater flexibility to invest our stable core deposits into higher yielding but safe investments to dividend excess capital held up at the bank back to the holding company so we could use it to fund other accretive activities and to extend our lending capabilities over time we believe that well be able to make green dot bank a more powerful competitive advantage in the marketplace and become a more material contributor to green dot corporations consolidated results now having updated you on our sixstep plan id like to bring you uptodate on the processor migration project this multiyear effort involves the migration of  million accounts from tsys to mastercard pts to manage of the risk we split the migration into four distinct waves each dealing with a specific part of our card base the first two waves happened on time and without material incident in late  and then again in march of this year wave three of the migration which went forward in may did not go as well as the prior conversion waves with approximately  cardholders or about  of our  millionplus active cardholders experiencing some type of service disruption ranging from minor to major the vast majority of all issues were fixed in just a few days and all systems have been working properly since that first week postmigration nevertheless it was a painful experience for us and our partners we cannot overemphasize how critical uninterrupted service is to our value proposition customers and to the success of our company were taking the matter very seriously and have taken and will continue to take the steps we feel are right to make sure our cardholders are served effectively first we paid out over  million to cardholders prior to memorial day in the form of cash credits and monthly fee waivers to show our sincere apology to impacted customers and as a way of thanking them for being great customers second the wave four conversion has been put on hold to give our processing teams time to perform a thorough root cause analysis design an appropriate remediation plan and retest the system once our technology leaders are comfortable we can proceed safely we will reschedule the wave four migration which now likely wont happen until sometime in the first half of  mark shifke will talk more about the economic implications in his section of todays remarks before i turn it over to mark i just wanted to cover a few corporate governance items that is first i want to welcome our new directors to the board nino fanlo and george gresham and i want to thank our investors for electing me to a new threeyear term of service second on june  the board appointed bill jacobs to be our new chairman many of you may know bill from his role at global payments he brings many years of operational board service and governance experience to green dot and we are delighted to have him serve as board chair thank you bill and with that ill now hand the call over to mark shifke mark mark l shifke  chief financial officer thanks steve id like to start by providing some insight into our strong performance in the quarter on the top and bottomline followed by commentary on our two business segments and how they each contributed to our results based on another quarter where we exceeded our expectations im pleased to be able to announce another modest topline guidance raise for the full year and will provide those details along with our soft guidance for q later in my prepared remarks first im pleased to report that we delivered  million in total operating revenue representing a yearoveryear increase of approximately  recall that due to moneypak discontinuation in early  and the negative impact it had to active cards and associated revenue over the course of the year we started this year with an approximate  million headwind that we would need to grow past just to break even in  on a yearoveryear basis so the fact that we grew in absolute terms in the quarter shows our growth plans are working as expected and actually a little bit better than expected revenue growth came from all of our product lines including prepaid cards gobank accounts cash transfers and our tax refund processing business tpg in our account services segment we saw a yearoveryear increase in revenue per actives of  driven by strong performance on our legacy portfolio plus better unit economics on our new products in addition in our processing and settlement segment revenue per cash transfer increased  revenue per reload continues to grow for two reasons first we no longer offer free reloads on our new suite of products and second the new moneypak sells for  more than the old moneypak had as the concentration of our portfolio receiving free reloads declines and as we sell more moneypaks and build more scale with that new product we expect our average revenue per reload will continue to rise so in the wake of the detour that started in late  when we introduced lower fee moneycards and then worsened with the negative impacts from the discontinuation of moneypak in  its encouraging to see robust organic growth in the account services segment as you may recall we had previously forecast that the revenues from our core prepaid business would return us to a growth trajectory in q as the numbers indicate we did exactly that adjusted ebitda margins in the quarter were also very strong and well ahead of our expectations adjusted ebitda in the quarter was  million including the absorption of  million of unusual incremental expenses associated with launching our new prepaid products and inclusive of one month work of higher walmart commission rate that did not lap in the quarter until may the majority of that strong underlying organic margin expansion was driven by what we believe to be four sustainable and repeatable factors one higher revenue per active card from our installed base of older prepaid cards two better unit economics from our new suite of prepaid cards three a continuing trend of higher revenue per reload transaction and four an increasingly more efficient operating platform allowing more of that incremental revenue to fall to the bottomline in terms of nongaap eps we exceeded our estimates and delivered  per share taking into account the incremental launch expenses we continued to generate strong cash flows in q with net cash generated from operations in the quarter equaling  million and unencumbered cash at the holding company equal to approximately  million after taking into account the  million asr we executed in april before i discuss guidance id like to talk about the financial implications of the may processing conversion event and the subsequent material costs we incurred or expect to incur related to items such as providing impacted customers with courtesy credits and fee reversals from wave three the cost of settling the class action lawsuit that was filed in connection with that conversion event and the cost of delaying the fourth and final conversion wave off of tsys and on to the mastercard pts platform until sometime in the first half of  we have discussed this matter with our new processing partners at mastercard they have been great partners and have reimbursed us for all material costs that were incurred by us in q and have committed to reimburse us for the incremental material costs that we expect to incur for the remainder of the year as such we expect there to be no material negative financial impact to green dot as a result of the processor conversion issues in  as it relates to  the sizing of any potential negative impact to green dot is a bit of an unknown at this point because we dont yet have a firm wave four conversion date scheduled although we expect it to occur in the first half of the year in any event until we ultimately complete the final conversion wave with all customer accounts off of the existing platform and successfully operating on the new platform in a normal fashion we would expect to continue to incur material incremental expenses for which we would seek additional reimbursement at that time now lets discuss our thoughts for the remainder of  on the revenue side our portfolio performed well in q and we believe we have a good visibility into and are quite encouraged by our revenue trends the quarter posted topline overperformance relative to our expectations of  million however offsetting that  million beat is that we have around  million of potential revenue headwinds related to some of our new initiatives in the second half of the year in particular were off to a slower start than we expected on green dot money as steve mentioned in his prepared remarks and the launch of one of our new card distribution partnerships we announced previously has been delayed from q into later this year or early next given that were increasing our fullyear revenue guidance by  million from a range of  million to  million to a new range of  million to  million we generated  million of revenue in the first half so our new fullyear guidance at the midpoint implies we will achieve  million of revenue in the second half of that we expect to generate  million of revenue in q implying  million in q this revised guidance reflects on the one hand the continued strong and improving results from our core prepaid and reload business lines in the first half and our conservatism around the timing and performance of our new suite of prepaid cards as we get more data around active card trends and expected lifetime revenue of those active cards and other new initiatives planned in the second half for adjusted ebitda we are currently tracking towards the higherend of our current range of  million to  million however given the delay noted above in some new initiatives and in performing the final wave four processor conversion that was originally planned to take place this year as well as our desire to get another quarter or two of data on our new card products and other new initiatives we have decided to hold steady at our current adjusted ebitda range until more certainty emerges in the second half as a result notwithstanding the  million adjusted ebitda beat and the  per share of nongaap eps beat we are not raising guidance in respect of adjusted ebitda or nongaap eps but we are reaffirming our prior guidance ranges for adjusted ebitda of  million to  million and nongaap eps of  to  per share for q implied guidance adjusted ebitda and nongaap eps are expected to be  million and  per share respectively aside from the question around potential incremental expenses and potential reimbursements related to the processor conversion delays we just discussed we are still on track to fulfill our commitment to achieve at least  and nongaap eps in  and with that i would like to ask the operator to open the phone for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from ramsey elassal of jefferies please go ahead christen chen  jefferies llc hi guys this is christen chen for ramsey thanks for taking my question steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure hi christen christen chen  jefferies llc hi can you provide some more color on the q and q guidance – cadence especially on the bottomline it seems like that q eps guide was somewhat shy of our model but the full year is still the same is there just some puts and takes there that we should be thinking about thanks mark l shifke  chief financial officer yeah look youre absolutely right on a full year basis were coming out to where we were going to come out before but weve accelerated some of that beat into q and then we didnt raise on the bottomline for the rest of year so what you have is pretty much the same full year result that we previously had steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer maybe we dont christen understand specifically the question christen chen  jefferies llc i guess – so the guide implies fee for acceleration into q i know you had called out in the prepared remarks that there was a delay of initiative a launch initiative from q to q but is there anything else we should be thinking about i mean we initially thought maybe this was related to the mastercard processing migration if theres going to be incremental expenses but it seems like mastercard has already gotten that taken care of and will be reimbursed so i guess were just wondering if theres something kind of the q or q migration that we should steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer no we dont think so but maybe what we can do christen is were looking at the face of chief accounting officer notice in the room who is sort of a little bit puzzled and maybe when we do the oneonones after we can better understand the nature of the disconnect and try to answer it mathematically but theres nothing unusual coming up in the room so i am not sure we know how to answer it christen chen  jefferies llc okay okay sure thank you fair enough steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sorry about that christen chen  jefferies llc no problem steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer okay operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani from kbw please go ahead tai dimaio  keefe bruyette  woods inc hi this is actually tai dimaio in for sanjay thanks for talking my question steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer no worries tai dimaio  keefe bruyette  woods inc i guess my question is a little bit more strategic i mean given where we are in the competitive cycle youve seen a lot of the large individuals exit i mean how do you think about your pricing on legacy accounts given that youre getting much higher per unit economics on the new accounts do you have the ability to price them up – would you – i mean how do you think about that steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah well so we did in some cases for the green dot portfolio we did a modest whats called the change in terms where we raised the monthly maintenance fee to match the new monthly maintenance fee on our new products that are sold so we were at  and we went to  and we did that fairly recently was that at the end of  we forget the dates remember we talked about it at that time and so it doesnt generate a tremendous amount of money because the cards dont have very long lives as you know but it does help somewhat and it helps normalize the difference between a new card and an old card in that respect so we did do that – we did not to do it on our other portfolios for various reasons but i also want to be clear that it isnt just that were getting better economics on the new cards and you look at these as an aging cohort so weve tracked the first  days  days  days and you keep going out until you get to the end of a cards prospective life in three years and sometimes later than three years for direct deposit customers we have some that have been on there for many years and so you first track in that first  day cohort because that really helps you understand the way that the things were likely to go if you will and so were getting more money on the new cards for sure because of the better unit economics of the fee plans and also because were doing things that are encouraging more behavior more spend more reloading which means better interchange and all those – reload fees and all those goodies but in the old cards even though the fees are largely the same except for the monthly maintenance fee on a segment of them which is not material to our overall revenue youve just seen better usage and so the extra revenue were getting is from people putting more money on the card and spending it more and seeing direct deposit become a bigger part of the portfolio and so they are very very valuable so wed never want to do anything to rock the boat unnecessarily of those existing cardholders and many of them frankly qualify for the fee waivers anyhow which is another reason why the change in terms doesnt generated a ton of money because they have the fee waiver from the direct deposit limits and the load limits so were just benefiting on both sides a terrific revenue growth per active card people have been on the system for months and years and many years in the case of our direct deposit customers and then the  day cohorts of the new customers which means – and hopefully as they get older will look even better than the customers we have today so in the same way that portfolios take time to decline like when we rolled out the new moneycard portfolio back at the end of  it takes time in that case a negative trend for that revenue to decline and then when you replace cards with better priced cards it takes time for that to build in our case were benefiting from both and thats why its looking so strong tai dimaio  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay that helps and then maybe my followup to that is on customer acquisition costs i mean have you seen the dynamic change maybe over the last year especially when you think about these new initiatives that youre rolling out are you kind of thinking about the level of investments related to that in a different way maybe to the past or is it kind of the same steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer so – well okay both so its the same in retail where the cost of hanging the card and merchandising the card and printing a package and all that kind of thing for filling a personalized card that doesnt change without regard to the fee schedule and our acquisition cost is the same in other words retail commissions outside of the walmart contract renewal last year and so forth those would all be consistent and you wouldnt see significant changes in our cost per acquisition for that channel but for cards sold online you have a different advantage when youre collecting more money and you have higher lifetime revenue per card you can afford to spend more on marketing on the internet click marketing different kinds of things that you couldnt do if you had a lower value card so when you have an internet generated card from one of our green dot direct channels which is a significant part of our business those you can have a little bit more leeway in how you market because you have a higher revenue generation per card and so it gives you an opportunity in channels that maybe you couldnt have competed in before having said that we tend to be cheapskates and we tend to hold ourselves to rigid cost per acquisition online and its just working not quite well so the answer is no change in your models where there shouldnt be to cost per acquisition but anytime you have a card generating more money in that first  days it gives us a little bit more leeway for how we may want to spend to acquire a customer tai dimaio  keefe bruyette  woods inc all right great thank you operator our next question comes from vasu govil of morgan stanley please go ahead vasu govil  morgan stanley  co llc hi thanks for taking my question i quickly wanted to ask about the active cards which were down  yearonyear and i think even on a qonq basis the decline seemed higher than in last years from q to q im guessing weve mostly – we are mostly done recycling the impact of the discontinued moneypak products but can you sort of elaborate on what was going on and what we should expect in the back half for active cards steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure well – so the first question is the decline is – in our view the results of the moneypak removal back in  you could just see if you remember that painful period of time we removed the product at the end of january some stragglers where there till the middle of february but essential it was gone in january and then starting at about march or april you just saw the decline in new card sales come down which predicates a decline in active cards and then you have fewer people who were buying the card – for moneycard buying cards which also generates a decline in active cards so the  million of decline yearoveryear is – the moneypak decline i believe is more than but you have offsetting impacts you have the moneypak users going away but then you also have other people who are retaining longer right which helps to build your active card so you have some portions of your portfolio increasing in actives you have the lower revenue generating guys thankfully decreasing in activity and active cards and the net is  down but your revenue per card is so much higher because the percentage of your customers who are the higher revenue producing customers just keep becoming a larger part of your active base so anyhow but thats the reason for the yearoveryear decline had we removed moneycard in  or something you would have seen it in a different year but thats why its more this year than in other years because moneypak is the big determinant of that in terms of when wed see active cards turning around we first have to lap the moneypak ecosystem declines which were expecting to be sometime about the end of this year and so well lap that period of decline so call it november december and i want to say from memory that the moneypak ecosystem in our view officially ended end of october early november so we wouldnt expect active card growth to happen until a period of stabilization in actives and then youd see that actual growth come back sometime in  the actual timing and rate of the active card stabilization then growth would depend on new unit sales of reloading cardholders and then the level of churn right in the existing installed base of actives and the higher the unit sales of reloading cards and the lower the churn rate of the installed active base means the higher the net active card base so that would happen sometime in our expectation in  sooner if churn is lower and sales are higher a little bit later if churn is higher or sales are lower and then we really rock and roll if sales are higher and churn is lower but we wouldnt want to get over our skis on that so were always modest in our expectations but thats how the math works vasu govil  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks for that and then just quickly on the green dot money product launch you talked about already starting to take some applications can you talk about the lending partners that youre working with have you signed a bunch i dont think weve seen announcements of the lending partners that youre working with steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer no yes we havent – the answer is i know of a bunch we have i want to say six or seven or maybe a little more than that signed up and getting ready to enroll and then they have a technology deployment into the site and i want to say we have about two or three currently active and reviewing our applications and we want to get up to a base of about  active lenders frankly there are not a zillion lenders who lend the people in our fico range the average green dot customer as you can imagine has a very low fico score and has a spotty lending history and a spotty banking history which is in many cases why they end up at green dot bank so its a tough customer to underwrite and theres not a lot of lenders who specialize in that and say hey i love this customer base i want to lend to them and then it gets even harder because of our brand name at green dot and our quite serious devotion to our customer base we cant and wont market loans that we think are in any way unfair or predatory or not in keeping with what we think is the kind of thing we want our customers to take advantage of so it doesnt mean that were not – we dont mean that to be overlypious or anything like that its just a matter of how we manage the brand so when you look at the clients out there who are willing to both serve this customer base and willing to charge them a rate that we think is appropriate and that we can live with theres just not a lot of lenders but we do have some good ones and there are ones that specialize in it and now we have to figure out how to get them better data and append – if you will append the data if theyre a green dot bank customer for example can we tell that lender that theyre on direct deposit or can we give that lender information about how long theyve been a good customer anything that can help that lender say yes and then take a risk on that customer and as we get that formula better as lenders get more confident in their decision making as we develop an underwriting track record i think youll see those approvals go up but one of the ways to go up to your point is have more lenders with more secret sauce in underwriting to hopefully say yes to more customers vasu govil  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks for taking my questions steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from george mihalos of cowen please go ahead george mihalos  cowen  co llc great thanks guys just wanted to delve a little bit more into the guidance – maybe you can breakdown the reasons for keeping the ebitda guidance where it is given the outperformance in q and then the revenue outperformance that were seeing it doesnt really sound like it has that much to do with the card migrations so maybe you can help us there a little bit mark l shifke  chief financial officer sure george look our beat in the quarter was  million but we believe were going to have revenue headwinds in the second half associated with the new initiatives and we believe they will now deliver about  million less than we had planned so we think that  million is really just a net beat of  million and thats why we took up our guidance to that extent on revenue on adjusted ebitda we beat by  million and we think there is about a  million bottomline headwind from the slow start that we have on green dot money and the delay in the new program launch and so we think there is around  million also of potential headwinds from the processor conversion event so as a consequence when you put that all together we raised revenue  million and were holding ebitda and eps flat steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer to us its just a mathematical equation in other words when we do the buildup were looking at who are the good guys and we take the good guys and then we see are there are any bad guys lurking in the dark shadows in the second half and we subtract out the bad guys and so thats the number you come up with could we be more aggressive based on our trends in our active card portfolio probably should we be more aggressive in our trends probably not and thats what i meant earlier by aging we only have  cohorts of day cohorts thats a pretty limited data set to play with guidance and so we want to be thoughtful and conservative and we do know as mark said we have anywhere from a  million to  million headwind on adjusted ebitda because of the processor thing and the slower start to those initiatives so mathematically it makes sense to hold steady and look in the old days would we have been more exuberant maybe i think its fair to say that were increasingly more thoughtful and conservative as we try to view our guidance which doesnt mean we cant miss it so who knows but we always try to guide where we believe we can meet it at the very least george mihalos  cowen  co llc okay appreciate that and if you guys can provide the percentage of revenue coming from your largest customer walmart this quarter steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer total revenue yes mark l shifke  chief financial officer i think the concentration this quarter is  steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah we want to remind you of something though because its easy to get confused so in the old days – in the olden days we used to give the concentration just of the walmart moneycard portfolio just that one portfolio remember we saw a lot of things at walmart thats just one part of it as the walmart moneycard portfolio and that one portfolio was  someodd of our revenue for the whole company this new number of  is everything we sell at walmart the walmart moneycard gift cards the green dot everyday visa product gobank reloads so its a – so the number is still lower than what used to be at  but it includes everything we sell whereas in the old days it was only the walmart moneycard portfolio george mihalos  cowen  co llc thanks steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yep you bet operator our next question comes from ashwin shirvaikar of citibank please go ahead steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer hi ashwin good to hear from you ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thank you for all the detail you guys are providing here i wanted to delve a little bit deeper into the aging cohort comment that you had – you had basically now – as you said maybe  day periods but you are beginning to see – possibly more attractive new consumer come in and i wanted to get an idea of how long it might take to – not to complete the transition but to reach something of a tipping point where you got sort of a sweet spot of enough good guys coming in that it offsets the downward pressure that might see on the other side steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah if you think about portfolio let me think of an imagery here i was trying to think of a softball lets use a softball im trying to think an analogy wed all think about and you have sort of the soft outer and then it gets a little bit more firm inside and then at the center of the softball you have a really hard core and so if i just said hey take your fingers and start peeling away at that softball you get to the first layer okay the second layer would be a little bit harder but youd really struggle to get rid of that hard core thats the same thing in a card portfolio like ours you have customers who are here today gone tomorrow thats where the soft outer core and they will turn fairly quickly although they are turning slower than they used to turn thats still been a benefit but theyll turn fairly quickly but then as you get on the middle those guys will be there forever so when you think about – well not forever but for many years because theyre on direct deposit they use the card for their everyday banking needs thats the core of your company the person you want to keep forever they deliver the best revenue and they stay with you the longest so when you think about a new product hitting the store shelves those new people are coming in and its going to take a while to figure out of those customers who are going to become your hard inner core that stays with you for years who are the people that are just going to reload once or never and throw the card away so the answer is youll replace if you will the first half of that softball you will replace in the course of  months of our average retention that we report just in the q is what eight months or something like that which is sort of a retention number thats everything mixed in together in a big mixing bowl then in theory over the course of eight months the vast majority of those cards will turn over but youll still be left over with those core – the hard inner core of that softball that will be with you for many years and so that sort of gives you a yearoveryear growth and it has the impact of making your revenue per average customer much higher because the guys in the outer softer core just dont contribute a lot so the answer is you will replace the soft outer core with new customers coming into system thats a positive sign the perfect storm if you will for revenue meaning in the good way the perfect combination is you keep that hard core of the old portfolio because theyre delivering tremendous revenues and they are waiving out of the fees anyhow for the most part so you want keep that hard core but youre replacing the soft core with new customers that are paying more money than the old customers used to come on and so thats what your ultimate hope is so youll never get rid of or not in the next year or two certainly – i shouldnt use words like never im speaking colloquially with you im not speaking in an audited fashion but youre not going to have all the customers leave you dont want them to leave theyll be with you for many years we have walmart moneycard customers that are seven years old we have green dot customers who are eight years nine years old so those will stay there but you will replace the easier to replace customers more quickly with higher fee cards so i dont know if thats helpful color commentary or if i confused everyone even more but does that make sense ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker no that makes sense it gives a good framework to think about it sort of a followup question is you do have the higher fee that you laid on higher per card fee and then the takeaway of the zero fee moneypak is there a situation sort of lets call it middle of next year where those things anniversary and then we should – as wed start thinking of modeling out the next  months to  months that it creates sort of a comp issue steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well this is the secret to understanding the cohorts the usage has been so much better than we thought it would be on the new cards in other words you sort of anticipate what might happen and i think when we first guided the year we said – and we disclosed our assumptions for the year if you remember and we said that one of our assumptions was that behavioral metrics on the new cards stay the same to the old cards and we werent sure if that was risky or not they could have been much worse lets say but it turns out theyre better so as you see these portfolios come together over the next year just like our current card of active cards keeps getting better and better thats been a trend over just i dont know if you remember we did the analysis last call but its many quarters in a row that our active cards have been getting better in terms of revenue per average active and so it could well be that we have thats still seasoning and coming together as long as the portfolio seasoning meaning your installed base keeps getting better because youre left at more and more of a hard core center to my previous analogy and because of new guys coming in are of higher money than the old guys replacing youll continue to have solid comps in theory in the model as you go but thats the part that we wouldnt know in another words if you were to say hey steve guide out  months youd have a pretty wide range of potential outcomes depending on the retention of that hard core from your existing portfolio and depending on how many of the new guys turn into hard core going forward the easy part is you replacing a  card with a  card that part is easy but frankly thats the smallest part of your revenue composition its really that hard core that generates all that revenue and thats why were trying to invest and have been investing in things like the ability to write checks to pay your rent and person to person payments and savings vault on the moneycard which is a savings account on the card all these kinds of cool things to try to make the card more meaningful cashback rewards right if youre buying the card that advertises buy me because ive cashback rewards youre not buying it i would assume to pay your phone bill and throw it away right so these are all the kinds of things were doing to try to encourage that hard core center to stick around and when you only have  days plus of data you wouldnt want to bet your life on it but the first  days has certainly been fulfilling as you can see from our results ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker yeah no absolutely my last question and this is kind of what i was trying to build up to is not to speak concretely of guidance for next year but the  for next year with everything thats going on all these initiatives and where they stand and some are a little bit ahead some are not where you want it to be but overall the  is that still sort of a good ballpark to think about steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well listen were still talking about it and that means we have confidence in it it could be higher yes if everything lines up and things work out yes it could be lower but we hope not – the only thing in  that is a negative that or one of the things we see in  that could be negative is as we mentioned on the call the process conversion while we feel like the platform would be ready to go and well convert and to the extent we not we believe that mastercard will continue to work with us and take care of us as they have well then thats okay but its hard to perfectly foretell the future on that and so i feel better once the conversion is done and everything is working great and we know that thats a thing of the past that will give me some comfort because that was supposed to happen this year right and its still might but our guess is first half of  and so i want to see that done and in the bag and lock down and thats good and then i want to see our active card cohorts working the way we want them to work are they matching our expectations is behavior still the same or better than what it is today and thats bit of an unknown but absent those two metrics if you will things should work out on the upside but weve always want to guide at a range that we believe we can hit ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker got it understood thank you steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah operator our next question comes from mike grondahl of northland securities please go ahead mike grondahl  northland securities inc thank you guys first question is there just anything else anecdotally you could share about the new cards with the higher economic just that youve seen in these first  days in terms of usage or any patterns developing steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think ill give you the high level i suppose mike look were thrilled with their performance and we talked about that in different ways in different metrics we havent broken apart the metrics for the new card versus existing card because its just too granular and itll drive people nuts with making their model but were currently obviously pleased with reloading behavior spend and all those other revenue generating activities that are driven by customer behavior those are all looking very positive look the reason why thats important is you cant fee yourself in the glory maybe for a month you can but you cant fee yourself in the glory because if people dont like the product or they dont feel like its a value then youre going to crash the portfolio so in addition to launching the products with different fees youve got to see people engaging in the usability of the card so the fees to us are the easiest part will people reload more money whats your first day reload rate whats the average amount of gdv whats your direct deposit enrollment all those things to us are way more important than the fees because they predict what that hard core to my previous analogy will be in the out months and the out years so all that behavior so far is looking positive but i want to caution again we have  day cohorts fee revenue is clearly up as you know and as customers use the card more they also pay more fees so there is another benefit to people engaging in the card more so were only have limited amount of data mike on this cohort analysis of the walmart cards and the new green dot cards but were very encouraged i dont know that i can give you – ill give you one anecdote those people – i dont want to leave you with nothing i want to give you something good we have a product which look great in the research lab but you never know what it looks like on the self and thats called the green dot  cash back visa its a debit card not a prepaid card and its targeted to the mass market not necessarily the low and moderate income segment and its the most expensive card weve ever sold in the companys history its  a month and it has  cash back on it and its a beautiful piece of plastic and its a gorgeous package using rich blues and whites and the card is a pearl white finish with the blue version of the visa logo its just a really nice piece of plastic and all those things matter and sales on that are doing very well and engagement on it is clearly a different kind of customer than a regular prepaid card so thats a little bit of an anecdote how is that mike grondahl  northland securities inc no thats helpful and then second question is the new moneypak i think its in  locations today plus cvs later this year how does that compare to the number of locations that the old moneypak was in steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well the old moneypak would have been in – im going to say all of our retailers or the vast majority so lets call it  retailers in the heyday call it the middle of  and there was cvs call it another  stores that brings you up to  retailers lets say so we have a long way to go having said that your biggest retailers are your biggest retailers right so the walgreens cvss rite aids all those the big winner is if down the line you can get it back into a walmart which we moved moneypak long time ago long before we moved it everywhere else could you get it into there could you get into – so we still have a lot of real estate left to go and we have a lot to prove to our partners we would never want to sell a product that made our retailers feel like there was something wrong with the product and i think for the most part the retailers we work with were proud of us for pulling the product it was very green dot thing to do it if you will in terms of making sure we are protecting customers and protecting the reputation of those retailers and then the new system is pretty slip i doubt youd use it necessarily to put money on your prepaid card but the back end interface if you got a moneypakcom is a really cool website and people are using it and its working and the fraud controls are working and its very exciting to see that come to fruition but look its a very small fraction of what the old moneypak would have been at its peak and so we have a long way to go in terms of bringing it back with more distribution and then we have to see how many more retailers can sell it but given that its only been in the market for a very short period of time we feel good about the real estate were getting back mike grondahl  northland securities inc got it thank you steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from reggie smith of jpmorgan please go ahead reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys congrats on the quarter just wanted to dig in on the comments you made earlier i think you said that in regards to new sales that you guys continue to be the share leader as you retails with your new products i guess my question is so youre still the leader has share shifted at all with the rollout of these higher priced products and i have a few followups steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so the answer is it has because weve lost – and this what i mentioned in the prepared remarks and its a good question ill give you some color on it – weve lost on the repeat oneanddone customers and that was part of the design of the products a significant part of our customer base use the products as a free throwaway product and which is not their fault its our fault thats how we design the product and theyre taking advantage of it but the card was cheaper than a gift card so you could buy a green dot card or a walmart card you buy it its a couple of bucks to buy but cheaper than a gift card than may be is  to buy you buy it you register it with the fake name like rumpelstiltskin or something we decline you right were not going to approve you for the card but you can spend down the card in the package and they do that and they pay their verizon bill or they pay their sprint bill or whatever it is and whatever their directv bill it was a very common one and they throw it away and they just do that every month but every month were doing a cip and going out to experian to get their data and to lexisnexis and were sending out plastic in the mail and all those kind of things so youre sitting here running a fulfillment cost and of course the retailer commission because the retailer gets paid whether that customer turns out to be longterm or shortterm so youre sitting here with an acquisition cost that is maybe  or  allin and a customer who by the time we went to collect the fee was already long gone they had made their bill they used it up and throw it away and thats the way its been for years with the company so its shouldnt be a surprise to us that it encouraged oneanddone behavior the other thing that we used to do is we sold cards for free on promotion and we may still do that its a great way to get people into that card but for a long time we were free at walgreens we were free at rite aid i forget where else we may have been free for a little bit at the retailers and you generate these massive amount of unit sales but the quality of those customers were horrific so youd see your revenue rise a little bit right and then you see your ebitda get crunched as these customers just generated losses and repeat losses so what weve done is weve peeled off by design that layer of repeat oneanddones and the card is priced now where youre more likely to the want to reload it youve already bought it you invested in it its now cheaper than to reload than it is to buy a new card before its cheaper to buy a new card than it was to reload and weve changed those dynamics and so we dont look at our market share as unit count because thats somewhat frankly irrelevant to the longterm i mean obviously its important intake fact but id rather sell lets pretend  cardholders who are reloading and generating strong lifetime revenue than  guys where were losing  a card right so the answer is were still far and away the share leader but weve absolutely given up some unit sales on the rack and were okay with that now the question is – in fact it was part of the design – so now the question is how do we sell and introduce the cardholders to a different kind of customer segment that people are buying us now and say green dot is for the serious prepaid cardholder and generate more of those customers its gone very well so far as you can see but we want to make sure that we get that out here and so the mantra in our sales effort is cut expenses sell more quality cards cut expenses sell more quality cards its a very simple metric and you will see our promotional activity or if you see what steve harvey talks on his tv shows or any of those you will see where the thrust of our promotional effort is reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc understood and i guess a followup to that you talked about i guess the usage of the new cards and that has been i guess better than what you had modeled initially just curious have the sales also been better than what you modeled so it sounds like youve got a better cardholder base than you thought i guess my question is is it a little bit larger than you thought as well or is it smaller or is it in line and then lastly when thinking about the uber relationship and i guess prefunding and direct deposit how should we think about the incremental expense associate with that or is there one how – the mechanics of how that works and whether thats a potential drag thanks steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so the answer is we dont really – we clearly have an expectation for new card sales but we model based on active cards and for the active cards we say would within a certain range i forget what it is a few points up or down and i think were basically within our range of that and ultimately its a combination of active cards and the revenue per active thats how we run the model and we dont particularly guide on unit sales although we have a forecast for each retailer and the reason is because its somewhat of a meaningless metric i can blow the door off of unit sales by saying buy a green dot card for free and well put  at acquisition right but youd see the company not do very well so thats how we model it and thats within line the next question is – i mean in the active cards and the revenue – the next question was about direct deposit – im sorry would you give me that last one again the cost of reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc yes so correct me if i dont understand this correctly but i thought with uber deal that you guys were prefunding the payroll and then it would settle with you guys maybe a day or two later im just curious is there costs associated with that and how should we think about that steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah the answer is its an implied cost were using our banks balance sheet right so every day you have settlements incoming every day you have settlements posting and outgoing and that would be a settlement in transit and thats what that is because youre getting the money every business day its no different by the way in fact its identical to what we do with our retailers and we have for  years when i reload a card – pick your favorite retailer reggie dollar general – when i reload a card at a dollar general the customers getting access to those funds the second they leave the store right but green dot doesnt get paid the second they leave the store were going to get pay the next business day or two days later or if its a long holiday weekend four days later but the customer got to use the money right away so theres always a fairly large outstanding receivables balance at the bank or settlement in transit and so when we underwrite and do a risk analysis on our balance sheet at the bank were underwriting that retail or that organization for their ability to make sure they pay us pack in the time agreed to and there would been an implied cost of money for that overnight or there would be an implied cost of money for the twoday but as you can imagine it wouldnt be significant and its just part of the revenue and the ebitda model for the product reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc got it understood thanks guys steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure operator our last question comes from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead bob p napoli  william blair  co llc thank you steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer napoli its been a long time good to hear from you bob p napoli  william blair  co llc yeah how are you doing buddy steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer very good bob p napoli  william blair  co llc any thoughts on adopting the emv cards for your prepaid cards steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer so the answer is were going do emv but its not going be until the later years when i say later im taking about end of  and then go out from there and it will be on those customers – boy the softball analogy is going to do me well today so back to that inner core i was trying to think of like a mountain where you water brush and the clay falls of easy making hard clay but i settled on the softball so question was the emv so we will serve the emv chips up on the cards that go to those hard core customers it would be very very wasteful to put an emv chip on a card that hangs on the rack that would be preposterous or to put an emv chip on a oneanddone reloader but clearly for high value customers direct deposit customers reloading customers there is a number of ways we can segment our active base and weve actually done the analysis and we do believe it will save us net some losses of persontoperson card transactions and youll see those rolling out towards the end of  and so thats one of the ways were going to both control the cost of that and at the same time make sure its a net positive by only putting the chip on those cards where the fraud risk is higher and where the loss of chargeoffs is higher bob p napoli  william blair  co llc makes sense how much revenue did you have from tpg in the quarter steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer i dont know that we disclosed it what you can do is you can look at the segment called processing and settlement and youll see a segment number and thats comprised of our cash transfer business reloads at retailers and tpg and there is probably some metrics in there – i know there is metrics in there as it relates to the numbers of taxes refunds theyve processed in the quarter and that type of thing and thats probably your best disclosure bob p napoli  william blair  co llc is that a big effect on the q to q ebitda mix shift steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer it is when you think of margins because tpg generates no revenue and all or very tiny revenue in the second half of the year but they still have the same staff right so you have – if you will your fixed expenses are evenly divided over the course of the year you have some higher variable expenses of call center or whatnot in the first part but over the full year they have their fixed expenses evenly divided but all the revenue front loaded primarily in the q straggling revenue into q and then tiny revenue three and four so it does affect your margins where youre going to have big fat margin margins in q which is not sustainable clearly for the whole year and then youre going to see in the back half compressed margins as a result of having to pay for that companys existence even though youre only generating revenue from your prepaid card business lines bob p napoli  william blair  co llc okay and youre doing – you have a lot of initiatives going on and of those initiatives which – what would be the top one or two that are going to have the biggest effect – could have the biggest effect on your business over the next few years steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well if you call the new cards and the cashback cards and so forth an initiative clearly those are the drivers of our business its our core business right so those would be big if you look at some of what ill call the ancillary initiatives or more of the side initiatives that could be high potential green dot money on paper should do really well if we can get lenders to say yes i know that sounds trite but if you think about the lending market the biggest issue people have in the lending market is the cost of acquisition right and the ability to get that in there because you have to pay what is it you probably track it better than i do but as much as  to  for a funded loan for a lender at green dot we have so many millions of customers coming in that were paying nothing for applicants the problem is weve got to figure out a way to get better applicants and to give that appended data to the underwriters so that they can have more to work with but that could be a good one if we can get that rolling right and thats a good one uber is going very well im stunned by the numbers of instant pay and how fast thats growing and i gave some statistics on that but that isnt as profitable or as big clearly as selling a prepaid card account so i think that – but if you had to say two i would say uber and green dot money have exciting potential initiatives not only for those companies like with uber but others like it and then as we can have more products they all work together exponentially remember on one of our slide decks we had the wheel of synergy and we talk about the fact that as we can build a lending product or as we can build another kind of product can you sell that through to the uber driver can you do this with that and these are all the conversations that were having about how we look at the longrange planning of the company how we can continue to grow with our existing customer base with new products and services so thats all part of what we look at but those are two good ones and moneypak is doing well which is in effect for us free for the price of asking right its already our brand and already our product and technology was already built and – or at least the core technology to process it and thats doing well so i think we have a lot of irons in the fire as you point out but our focus is always the core business because thats what pays the bills and so we always want to have the best prepaid products we always want to have the best and most compelling fee schedules and services and features weve always want to have the most beautiful packages on the rack we always want to make sure we are in the best retailers all that blocking and tackling is something we focus on all the time bob p napoli  william blair  co llc how should we think about revenue from uber – the uber relationship steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well its gosh i dont know how youd say that its all part of our active cards right so i would think of it as me as thinking of it as being incremental and additive but not generating what a prepaid card would generate in total although the uber gobank accounts if that driver is using it as their core checking account clearly not all of the  that weve registered so far are just like with prepaid cards you have a lot of people who just want to get paid and they could care less right and they get their money off the card at their nearest atm you have others who say oh this is a cool checking account ill use this and those guys will do very well so – but theyre all part of that active card portfolio in the account services segment bob p napoli  william blair  co llc and last question and this is – obviously the board of directors has changed radically over the past few months and how is that – and how are you working with the new board and can you give any color into how – how things are going since the changes that would be helpful steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well

call today i will cover the highlights of the quarter and the year and review our longterm strategic roadmap well also talk about our sixstep plan to drive material eps growth so that you know what were planning and you can track our progress along the way then mark will share some additional financial detail and provide our financial outlook for  with some preliminary thoughts on  today we also want to acknowledge the feedback we recently received from one of our largest stockholders harvest capital strategies our investors are customers of green dot and disappointing one of our customers is something our company our board and i as founder and chairman take very seriously i can assure you we want to make harvest a fan and we are taking their feedback into careful consideration we intend to engage with harvest in an effort to resolve the situation peacefully and respectfully at the same time were committed to doing whats in the best interest of all of green dot shareholders most importantly whats better than talking about performance is actually performing and delivering shareholder value mark and i and the amazingly talented green dot worldwide team is dedicated to growing our business and driving eps so with that lets get into the call we performed as expected in q with our acquisitions keeping us essentially even in yearoveryear nongaap revenue at  million despite the declining revenue from our legacy business line flow through to profit and eps was materially lower in the quarter because of two reasons primarily one we paid higher commissions to walmart in the quarter than in the prior year period and two the legacy revenue we lost was of much higher margin than the acquired revenue we gained in this particular quarter on a full year consolidated basis  was a very strong year for green dot with doubledigit growth in nongaap revenue and adjusted ebitda again driven by acquisitions the standalone revenue and adjusted ebitda run rates of our acquired entities plus the extra profit delivered from integration synergies made a huge positive impact on the year and allowed us to stay flat in nongaap eps at  despite a significant yearoveryear revenue decline related to the discontinuation of moneypak and a lower revenue from the private label portfolio with everyones great efforts our acquisitions were able to fill in the large void caused by the declines in our legacy business lines and serve to maintain and even grow our yearoveryear financial results while we continue to invest in all the cool new things that are designed to get our private label program and our cash transfer businesses back on track now with those new products rolling out as we speak and all the new cost saving initiatives and new products being deployed now and through the rest of the year we believe were in really good shape to have all the pots boiling at the same time as we exit  both legacy business lines and acquired entities delivering revenue and our platform and processing investments delivering expense savings allowing the consolidated green dot to deliver material eps growth my thanks to our leadership teams at tpg and accountnow in particular for their terrific efforts i also want to call out renee opell who is an operations leader in our enterprise product delivery office who spearheaded the integration efforts for accountnow and achievecard the integration efforts on just those acquisitions alone delivered an additional approximate  million of adjusted ebitda through the end of the fourth quarter of the year starting within just a few months of closing those deals i think that result is a testament to not only the strength of our operating team but also to the efficiency of the green dot operating platform which we believe has a lot more efficiency still to come now id like to talk about green dots sixstep plan to get to  or better of eps in  as background green dots card business is based on portfolio economics we have millions of cardholders in different vintages within the portfolio so when something happens good or bad it takes time for that event to unfold and the results to be seen so when you roll out lower fee cards for example it might take six months or more for those lower fee cards to become a large enough mix of the portfolio to start actually pushing overall portfolio revenue lower the reverse is also true when you do something good like replace the older lower fee cards with new more profitable cards like we just got done doing on walmart and like we are about to do everywhere else it also takes some time about six months or so from launch for those new cards to become a big enough part of the mix to start pushing revenue higher and then build upward momentum from there so with that in mind heres our simple sixstep plan number one launch new more appealing prepaid products with materially better unit economics at all  green dot retailers this is already completed at walmart with all remaining major retailers completed by april number two bring back moneypak with new risk controls the new moneypak is expected to be on sale in the first half of the year number three launch highpotential initiatives that map to our strategic roadmap an example would be the green dot money project or the secured credit card project number four launch major platform initiatives that drive around  million or more in expense reductions in  for example the new risk and call center platforms and further integrations of our acquisitions number five make opportunistic and accretive acquisitions using cash or debt for example therere still a handful of attractive prepaid assets that remain in the market and last but certainly not least number six continue to buy back stock at a rate of  million annually so with that plan in mind lets talk about whats already well in process to achieve that goal of  in  theres not enough time to go into detail on all the things were doing but i would like to share a few of the bigger news items on the call today and then encourage you to review the investor deck for more detailed information first green dot bank received regulatory approval in late january to use its bank charter to engage in consumer lending the ability to engage in certain lending activities enables the bank to increase its profit contribution to the consolidated green dot over time and can help increase our brands relevance and importance to our customer segment green dot banks first lending product on a national scale will be the green dot bank secured credit card next green dots new lending marketplace initiative green dot money is in development with plans to launch in summer while its in the early stages of development we believe this initiative has the potential to generate increased customer loyalty and high margin revenue from placement fees paid to green dot by the marketplace lenders who are successfully paired with borrowers we also think the lending marketplace concept is a really smart way for us to provide unsecured credit to our customer base without putting our company and our bank at risk unsecured lending especially to consumers with low fico scores is very risky business both green dot money the loans both the upside and the downside belong to the marketplace lenders who are experienced and confident in their ability to underwrite low income consumer green dots role would simply be the matchmaker – no capital at risk next we have some distribution partners to announce first green dot is pleased to welcome onemain financial to our family of green dot partners onemain customers will soon be given the option to place their loan proceeds on a cobranded prepaid card in lieu of getting the loan on a check or traditional bank deposit taking the loan proceeds on a green dot card allows the customer to access their loan proceeds more quickly and conveniently and free of charge at any of our free atms and elsewhere onemain issues a lot of loans with a lot of gdv annually and so this has the potential to become a nice sized program for us onemain is a great company and a highly pro consumer lender and i want to thank dave hogan and jay levine for their partnership next since last quarter green dot signed a number of new retail stores and new check cashing locations in particular id like to welcome aafes the army and air force exchange service to the list of green dot retail locations americas military service men and women represent a large customer segment for green dots products and services and we are so proud to now be available on base for americas military personnel and their families on the product front we have completed the launch of the new walmart moneycard product and the new green dot everyday visa product at all walmart stores nationwide both prepaid products launched on time and on budget and offer superior features for customers and superior unit economics for green dot compared to all previous moneycard and green dot card versions in the past the rollouts of the new green dot everyday prepaid cards both mastercard and visa and the new green dot  cash back debit card will be at green dots remaining  or so retail locations on schedule and on budget with substantially all retailer stock in the new products by the end of april the rollout of the new moneypak product is on schedule to launch in the first half of the year the new moneypak with mobile and webbased risk controls is designed to help us safely win back former users of the original moneypak product and tpg green dots tax refund processing subsidiary rolled out a new green dot prepaid card integration where customers of eros using tpgs refund processing services are offered the opportunity to receive their tax refund on a green dot prepaid card additionally select customers can receive up to a  advance of their tax refund amount loaded to that green dot prepaid card the program rolled out in january to a select group of independent tax preparers nationwide in q green dot completed the first wave of account conversions from its legacy tsys processing platform to its new mastercard pts processing platform this wave consisted of approximately  million consumer records or approximately  of all accounts on file migrating so many millions of customers with so many billions of dollars in deposits is not something you do with haste green dots customer size makes it a top  debit card issuer so weve definitely taken our time to make sure we get it right nevertheless were on track to complete the remaining conversion waves over the course of  once completed starting in  on a fullyear basis the net savings in other words what well save annually versus what we spend cumulatively on development and the portion well depreciate annually is expected to generate a positive  of incremental nongaap eps in  growing as volumes grow in future years and lastly but not certainly least since q green dot completed an additional  million in share buybacks as part of the companys previously announced  million repurchase authorization so far in the first six months since the buyback program received regulatory approval green dot has repurchased  million of its shares the company is committed to executing the remaining  million over the next  months on the topic of capital as a general rule we havent talked a lot about green dot bank but its probably a good time to give you some insight into why we feel our bank is such an important and strategic part of green dot a bank is the entire regulatory underpinning of any prepaid program relying on a small thirdparty bank to run your entire company is very risky as evidenced by the challenges at the prepaid industrys largest  rental banks next by being our own bank we get to set our own risk policies and product roadmaps in accordance with regulation of course and good common sense all the stuff weve done and plan to be doing with gobank and all the new features on our prepaid cards and our ability to issue a secured credit card or the ability to legally operate green dot money nationwide without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on obtaining additional licenses is all an advantage of owning a bank lastly the bank saves green dot a lot of money every year in  green dot bank contributed  million in pretax profit contribution to green dot corporation through cost savings and interest income this is money that our competitors pay to another bank that we get to pay to ourselves on a taxadjusted basis this means the bank contributed around  per share in nongaap eps to green dot in  and we can expect it to contribute more in  should volumes grow in fact our bank is a big reason why we believe our operating platform is so much more efficient than anyone else in our industry now of course we do need to keep around  million in restricted cash tied up as tier  capital thats money we could use to buy back shares or otherwise invest so lets look at that if we sold the bank wed still need to hold around  million in restricted cash to hold as a security deposit for the thirdparty issuing bank and for certain state security bonds that nonbanks typically need to carry so that would free up only  million then we need to pay that other bank the annual issuing fees that we currently pay to ourselves so on a purely financial comparison putting aside all the risk and strategic benefit we would either earn at least  million in pretax earnings every year and growing as volumes grow from that  million in freed up capital just to break even so unless we think we could consistently generate an annual riskfree return of say  million to  million pretax or better on  million of capital then perhaps we can feel justified in keeping that level of restricted cash in the bank nevertheless we do think our tier  capital requirements are high and could come down over time and we do believe the bank will have the opportunity to earn more money over time on new programs like lending higher interest earnings on float and the like green dots longterm strategic roadmap the summary of which is in the ir deck that accompanies this call has been a remarkably prophetic and resilient document over the years since we first started formulating the key concepts in preparation for becoming a bank holding company it predicted the need for green dot to develop deep mobile expertise and become a fintech leader if it intended to be relevant to consumers in the future with new key agreements and close highvalue new opportunity it predicted the changing regulatory landscape and predicted the risk of relying on small thirdparty banks as the foundation for our business it predicted the consolidation of the prepaid industry and the needs of reserve cash to make strategic acquisitions to grow and diversify as competition intensifies it anticipated the need to invest in national marketing of the green dot brand name so that our products could have brand appeal and pricing power as the industry matured and the product itself became more commoditized of course we didnt get everything right while we anticipated competition we missed the timing and fortitude of that competition in  and  as our plan was first being developed who could have guessed that american express would spend an estimated  billion trying to beat green dot we also missed the moneypak issue in those days victimassisted fraud was not a defined term or a common activity luckily our longterm strategic plan did predict two strategic outcomes exactly right at number one if we stuck to our plan and focused on longterm outcomes when all the dust settled green dot would reign supreme as the absolute handsdown undisputed champion of the prepaid wars the best brand the best products the most customers the most revenue and the most profit and when the hard work was done like recruiting the best team buying a bank becoming a fintech leader creating the best products building a great brand diversifying revenue renewing walmart under a longterm agreement that we would then be in a position to materially grow eps while the  private label fee changes and the  moneypak discontinuation created a revenue detour on our road to growth make no mistake that with the launch of our new prepaid products and the many new initiatives underway we are now back on the main highway and we absolutely intend to arrive in style at our destination of material eps growth in future years more than half of all american households have an annual income of less than  with this population segment getting bigger every year this is green dots customer base and we want to be their bank for prepaid cards debit cards checking accounts and now secured credit cards and through our online lending market place unsecured loans and perhaps even more over time because of our teams collective longterm focus strategic prowess and operational discipline we believe green dot has made it through the jungles of uncertainty and is now free to pursue its destiny as the bank of this america green dot isnt a prepaid card marketer nor a prepaid card program manager green dot is a big growing ubiquitously distributed and increasingly famous fintechpowered branchless bank as green dots largest shareholder i believe our ability to now monetize all our hard work and drive material eps growth is clear obvious and well within reach and with that ill hand it over to mark shifke mark mark l shifke  chief financial officer thank you steve for the quarter green dot posted  million in nongaap total operating revenue  million in adjusted ebitda and  in nongaap earnings per share the quarter ended up consistent with our financial guidance in todays supplemental slides and earnings release we provided select metrics including the number of active cards revenue per active card processing and settlement revenue and the number of processing and settlement transactions as we manage the company today we really focus on these metrics as primary drivers of revenue and profitability so as you can derive from that data our portfolio of active cards declined by  cards from the prior year period to  million cards in the fourth quarter this year but as forecasted fourth quarter actives were flat with the third quarter reflecting signs of portfolio stabilization you will also notice that processing and settlement services revenue and total transactions also showed sequential stabilization from q to q so between those two metrics – active cards and reloads – we believe that our customer base has now settled into a more stable position after all the noise from moneypaks removal last year we believe the revenue from those active cards is up on a consolidated basis because the customers we lost were mostly casual users and the customers that remain are more committed customers who drive more gdv spend in other revenuegenerating activities revenue in the quarter was essentially flat yearoveryear but the margin on that revenue was materially lower than a year ago delivering just  million in adjusted ebitda nongaap diluted earnings per share was  for the quarter these results were consistent with the guidance we provided on the third quarter earnings call there are two primary reasons for the lower margins in the quarter first this year we had the additional expense of the higher commissions on the moneycard program second the composition of the revenue this year is different than last because our acquisitions accounted for approximately the same amount of revenue that our legacy business lost so thats how we stayed even on the top line while the acquired revenue from companies like accountnow and achieve sic achievecard  have good margins consistent with our overall average margins across the company the revenue we lost on our legacy business was high incremental margin delivered from our large legacy scale platform so the top line remained roughly flat but the margin of the revenue we lost was much higher than the margin of the revenue that replaced it when you lose incremental revenue on an atscale platform aside from variable cost it comes right off the bottom line the good news is that the reverse is also true so as our new cards with better unit economics begin flowing through our active card base this year and next and as moneypak returns and generate sales we would expect to see that incremental revenue aside from the associated variable cost also drop right to the bottom line now lets discuss our  and some preliminary views on  expectations we entered  with  million actives versus  million actives last year and with a run rate of  million cash transfers versus  million cash transfers last year together this creates a revenue headwind this year in the range of  so while we believe that the breadth and scale of our new organic initiatives which are already underway can enable us to stop the declines in our legacy business turn the corner and begin to grow over the course of  we are not expecting very much absolute revenue growth in the aggregate this year because we first need to grow enough to make up for that headwind in preparing our guidance we believe we have made modest assumptions related to the key drivers in our consolidated business that you can review on page  of the investor deck i also want to call out that this year we are incurring an unusual incremental launch expense of approximately  million for incremental packaging production and merchandising costs these expenses are above and beyond normal product merchandising levels because it includes a complete removal and destruction of old product as well as the placement of new product at nearly all  green dot retail locations this expense does not repeat in  given the nature of these expenses we will provide guidance both with and without those expenses included in adjusted ebitda given all of this we are providing the following guidance for  for full year total nongaap operating revenues to be between  million and  million adjusted ebitda is forecast to be between  million and  million adjusted eps is forecast to be between  and  per share both of these include the  million in expenses i just described excluding the onetime and unusual launch expenses adjusted ebitda is forecast to be between  million and  million and nongaap eps to be between  and  a share in terms of capital management we have already repurchased an additional  million of stocks since q in addition to having completed our  million asr last year we anticipate completing another  million of purchases this year any future share repurchase activity is not included in our eps guidance we are assuming approximately  million average diluted shares outstanding in our adjusted eps forecast for  we expect to build on the momentum from  as youll see in the supplemental slides that accompany this presentation weve identified a sixstep plan to drive earnings per share growth to achieve  in nongaap eps in  we expect revenue growth in  will benefit from a full year of all the new products being in market we expect also to benefit from  million in cost savings that flow from a full year of actions were taking in  as well as a new processor relationship ongoing savings from the gobank technology platform efficiencies from new risk and call center technologies and further integration of previously acquired entities to sum it up we believe  represents the end of detour while the headwinds still weigh on our legacy business throughout  we can see a recovery in sight if all goes as planned with material eps growth in  as we think about q expectations tax season plays a big part in our q results both because of the way tax refunds impact card sales and interchange from the gdv provided by tax refunds to our customers but also because the tax season is the bread and butter of our tax refund processing subsidiary tpg nearly all of that divisions revenue and earnings happens between january and april this year as you have no doubt read in the news the irs has intentionally slowed down refund disbursements and checks sent out and as of earlier this week with about  behind the same date last year in disbursements so our yearoveryear comps todate at tpg and for the prepaid sales related to tax season are a bit hard to read ultimately all the tax refunds get processed and all the refunds get disbursed but the timing this year is clearly way different than last so it could be that some checks and disbursements to cards flows into the year more in march and april than it did last year in any event based on irs disbursement trendings todate and our understanding of how checks and refunds will flow out of the irs over the next  days we are estimating that we will end up delivering around  of our full year midpoint revenue expectation of  million to come in q with any timing difference on tax refundrelated revenue being pushed into april now lets go to the phones for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session as a courtesy we please ask that you limit yourself to one question and a single followup if you have further questions you may reenter the question queue at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster and our first question will come from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer hi sanjay hello operator hi mr sakhrani are you there your phone may be muted sanjay sakhrani  keefe bruyette  woods inc yeah im sorry can you hear me now steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah hi sanjay sanjay sakhrani  keefe bruyette  woods inc right okay thanks for all the color i guess im just trying to figure out how we should think about the core growth going forward i understand  has some headwinds but maybe as we look out to  how should we think about your revenue growth profile and kind of the ebitda margins you could achieve steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer you mean on the legacy business or the consolidated enterprise sanjay sakhrani  keefe bruyette  woods inc consolidated enterprise steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well so ill give you our aspirational growth its always hard for any ceo to come up with guidance for the long term thats taken specifically so let me give you our aspiration the doubledigit number that  growth is what we aspire to we hit it and exceeded it as you know this year despite our legacy business having some challenges a lot of challenges but that was through acquisitions our macro prepaid our core heritage green dot that macro is not growing as fast as it used to grow so that means for us to hit that  number we have to have other products and services thats why green dot money is so important thats why the ability to have credit is so important and some of the other new tactics that we have out there better merchandising or promotions or marketing but aspirationally that  number is what we stuck to weve hit it many years some other years weve not but that still is our aspiration long term sanjay sakhrani  keefe bruyette  woods inc when we think about the margins of the business steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well ive said this for many many years and ill say it again because its true anything without a  before it is not appropriate for a business three of the past four years had a  in front of it  maybe did not maybe that was  or  but in every other year over the past four years weve hit it we hit it again in  we are forecast to easily hit it again in this year for our company in  so were always looking at that number as a guide and a gauge of our success we want it to be in the s and how big in the s how far up can we go in the s depends on our ability to continue to create efficiencies and grow revenue on our scale platform sanjay sakhrani  keefe bruyette  woods inc  mark l shifke  chief financial officer hey sanjay its mark i just was going to echo and just further step up  what steve has said i think we have some tailwinds pushing us in the direction of nice margin as were going into the year our products have higher unit economics both on card and cash transfer and were realizing the benefits of our investments in technology so we are looking over time to seeing increasingly greater gross margins sanjay sakhrani  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay great and just my followup on a unit economic increase that you guys are seeing it looks like amex is retrenching from prepaid and i noticed some of the slides at the back of your deck kind of speak to their spacing relative to yours is that allowing you to take up the unit cost and how do you compare relative to your peers in terms of cost for card steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer one of the biggest – great question and one that is fun to answer because i think weve done such a great job here one of the biggest early strategic concepts we had going back years ago on the strategic roadmap was that every business – look we invented the product right but every business at some point commoditizes nobody is special forever so we have to invest in the brand give green dot some star power make it important so youre not just a piece of plastic hanging on the shelf weve done that really really quite well i dont think anybody questions the power of the brand and that means when people go up to the rack they see value in the green dot brand beyond the fact that its a prepaid card just like you think kelloggs brand frosted flakes may be a better quality than uncle johns  frosted flakes or something else so for that reason weve done a really good job with being able to have pricing power and if you look at the slide deck that goes along with this call we have photographs front and back all of our fees are always on the back of the package so consumers can easily see them and you can easily see them as an investor and if you take a look at the fees what youll notice is that they are higher than our old products but still below the market in other words if you think of the high watermark as net spend so thatd be the highest price on the market it used to be that we are way rockbottomed than the other  people in the middle were now sort of in the middle and thats been still on top and nobody is really less at this point except for our own products which would be the walmart moneycard which is still the lowest priced product in the market so weve been able to increase pricing power and we think that thats going to be really helpful and beneficial to us over time at the same time i want to be clear about this weve added a lot of value to the card so this isnt like we raised pricing and said hey thats the end of that a green dot prepaid card today or a walmart moneycard could be sanjay your checking account it has all the same features better because frankly our mobile apps are better likely than the bank youre using unless youre using chase which has a really good mobile app but our mobile app is really really good and the features on it the ability to deposit checks and look at your budget and use an embedded fdicinsured savings account and all the atms and everything else its a really great product that increasingly has more value for our consumer so yes the pricing has come up aligned with some more margin but the features and the value have also come up for the consumer as well sanjay sakhrani  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay thank you operator our next question will come from tientsin huang of jpmorgan please go ahead tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for all the details i guess my question kind of building on what sanjay was asking about just the visibility into some of these things i guess the cost side i think it sounds like you have some good visibility there but just with the price changes and i dont know if the elasticity has changed and then you got moneypak  coming out a lot of new stuff coming up on the rack  where do you have high visibility versus low visibility can you write that  maybe for us and give us an idea on the range of outcomes steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think so whenever youre launching so many new products you really have to be thoughtful and careful nothing at green dot is on a whim or pulled out of your left pocket or something like that because were highly regulated enterprise everythings got to be thoughtfully worked out have a lot of research behind it a lot of operational dress rehearsal if you will and thats no different with these cards so weve actually been in the market undercover for some time at a large number of eleven stores and cvs stores with a higher price card to see what would happen in those cases were actually charging a higher fee than we ended up charging just to see what is the elasticity how would those play out we also did a price increase some time ago for other services with a large segment of customers about a year and a half ago so weve been planning this for a very long time and we wanted to see what would happen over the course of the year or year and a half if we took the fee from  to   and we researched that so between our actual inmarket test for the last number of months and the fee changes we did about a year and a half ago we have a good sense for what happens with the behavior which the answer is nothing it stays exactly the way it is and so we think we are in good shape there weve been on sale for about  days something like that at walmart and thats been going well also so we think we have good visibility into what the fee collection will be how the early acquisition rates will be for these cards now what dont we know behavioral curves and retention happens over time its just been  you have to build your cohorts so its going to take us some months to get to a sixmonth cohort or a ninemonth cohort to see how these cards are performing in relation to other cards the only data we have is what we did with the fee changes we did a year and a half ago so there is some risk there it could be that theres something about these cards that in a year look different a year in rears than what we think but so far so good and theyve been fairly well researched so we think we are pretty good on that that we have the most visibility in so id rank that tientsin number one most visibility moneypak we are budgeting and thinking very little about because we just dont know theres an example where the visibility is not clear we know that people still look for the product we know that everybody knows the name of the product we know theres still a market for the product how quickly will people come back how will it be adopted we dont know so that weve sort of weighed down in our modeling right and then the initiatives with the least amount of visibility meaning the ones that we have to wait to find out would be green dot money and the secured credit card it makes incredible sense on paper right we have so many millions of people who come to our websites every month who call our call centers every month and we know that through research and actually trying it we have a credit pilot thats been going on for about three months we know that when people see the opportunity to apply for credit our customers will do that quickly so we dont have a lot of risk on how many folks are filling out an application that we feel pretty good about what we dont know is with our marketplace lenders the average approval rate in other channels is about  so thats in fact what the approval rate is in real life in our marketplace will there be something about our customer base that is less underwritable than other low income populations or is there something about the use of the internet where youll get a lot of garbage applications that are not able to be translated to something underwritable that you dont know right so we need to figure out the underwriting approval rate and how that model plays out so i think that would be the one that is most speculative but a really safe bet i guess youd say and then the one that were most sure about as are the ones that were rolling out right now which is our card products because we know how they perform theyre in the market we know what the fees are and after  years of experience we understand how to model the monthly fees tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc okay thats good to know just a quick followup there just on the sales and marketing front then just to make sure these things get out there and the education as such is that budgeted in there and how much flex is there on your sales and marketing for advertising steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer so any marketing expense we plan on spending is part of that adjusted ebitda forecast that mark just gave you and again at this point the company is large enough and our marketing programs flexible enough where there is no incremental marketing needed for it in terms of spend i mean tientsin to give you a sense and i remember i think i had this stat at the investor conference we did together back in december we have  million consumers who come to one of our website properties every month whether we want them to or not they come for various reasons they saw a tv ad theyre buying the card theyre checking their balance whatever the case may be you have  million who call our worldwide call centers every year – every month im sorry so every month you have  million people talking to hopefully an ivr machine a computer if they go to a desktop and talk to an operator theyre talking to somebody in the philippines or one of our remote facilities and theres an opportunity to inform those people automatedly in other words on the ivr interested in a loan go to greendotmoneycom so we think that we have plenty of opportunity to get consumers to try our products just with that and lastly we have this awesome relationship with steve harvey who has really been a fabulous spokesperson for us in terms of the scores how its working the notoriety he does a great job with our product and so theres always an opportunity to have him mention this product or any other so between all of our web properties and the size of our company and our installed customer base were feeling pretty good that theres no incremental marketing needed tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc okay thats good to know thanks steve for the update steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer you bet operator our next question will come from ramsey elassal from jefferies please go ahead ramsey elassal  jefferies llc sure i guess my first question has to do with harvest capitals activist campaign to put new directors on the board how have you responded to them steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah well its a good question and i appreciate it and i guess here – well let me think how to describe it firstly im quite sincere in saying that we appreciate harvests activism in our stock and thats not to say i agree with all of jeff oshers points or his conclusions but i suppose the job of the activist is to say and write sensational things of solicited reaction and i actually dont take it personally will the harvest filing make us a better company will it make me a better ceo i actually think it will were certainly all paying attention thats for sure and being open to a wide variety of input criticism opinions and perspectives is a really good thing and ive taken the underlying meaning of every one of harvest comments seriously even if i dont take jeffs actual words or conclusion seriously so it any event green dot has a good board we have some very seasoned folks on the board as you know and weve talked about the most appropriate things we can do and here is what we decided first and foremost we all agreed that the best thing we can do for ourselves and our shareholders is to continue to execute our plan and grow eps because nothing succeeds like success we feel weve done a very good job of strategically guiding our company to a great place over many years and now we are in a position to show harvest and all of our investors what we can do next from a tactical perspective we think its a fair statement that we could benefit from expanding our board and seeking to invite different perspectives people may not realize this but we have new faces on the board in fact four out of the seven board members besides me are new to the company in just past few years so its not an all boys or actually we have a lot of women on the board so not an all girls club or anything like that but we do like the idea of having some fresh faces and new perspectives to help guide the ship and to that end its a good time to tell you that we have decided to increase the size of our board and expand its membership mary dent from our nongov committee did in fact call jeff osher at harvest and then our board also sent harvest a letter letting them know that we are expanding our board and that would very much like harvest to help us recruit new members and for them to suggest some names of candidates who they feel would be great additions to our board in other words whether or not theres a proxy fight down the road if there is great people let us have the names we can put them on without a proxy fight and save everyone a lot of money and we can make that as part of a committee selection process but we also think that many of our top  shareholders would also have great ideas for superstar board members for green dot green dot is such a cool and important company that im sure many talented people would love to serve on our board and so to that end mark and i and others from green dots board will be calling and meeting with our top  shareholders to get their thoughts on all of this and to see if they can introduce us to some great board members who would be rock stars and who could add value so thats sort of where we left it and beyond that were hoping that our performance over time will speak for itself ramsey elassal  jefferies llc this is kind of a related question there was some press out recently about you guys potentially exploring strategic alternatives i guess i know this is a tough thing to comment on and i have a feeling of what you might say but can you comment on the validity of reports and is there any kind of formal process in place to look at strategic alternatives for the company steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer well i kept leaving – i keep leaving postit notes in jamie dimons bathroom saying when you get time call please  but he hasnt responded yet the answer is clearly i cant comment on rumors in the press well look at what can i say let me say it this way the answer is no weve not hired a banker to explore options to sell the company were working with a banker as part of what you do when you have a b filing and thats part of the normal protocol but not for the purpose of selling the company but at the same time look im the largest shareholder of the company by far ive bought shares over the years about  million of extra shares personally and on top of that i havent sold shares since november of  so its five years so clearly i like every other investor has an obligation and a desire to maximize their value so i guess what im trying to say is while were not preparing coffee cake and tea for the open house or anything like that at green dot of course as chairman of the board and largest shareholder of course as a board with heavyweight people like we have on the green dot board would we be open to offers would we have conversations are we openminded to that topic of course itd be silly to say were not is it something that were pursuing no ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay great i appreciate your responses steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure you bet operator our next question will come from ashish sabadra from deutsche bank please go ahead ashish sabadra  deutsche bank securities inc steve thanks for the incremental color just quickly mark you talked about revenue for the first quarter but just as we think about the cadence for the full year i understand you dont want to give quarterly guidance but just thinking about the cadence as the headwinds anniversary and new products come on how should we think about the cadence on the revenue growth side steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer on the revenue growth side ashish sabadra  deutsche bank securities inc yeah steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer you mean how we grow through the quarters you mean ashish sabadra  deutsche bank securities inc yeah steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer oh gosh were so seasonal well  i dont mean to step on it but mark l shifke  chief financial officer look i think the way we have thought about this is we were really focusing a little bit on where is the first quarter likely to come out relative to where it did last year and thinking about how tax season is somewhat off this year than it was last year i think last year something – a little over  of our overall revenue showed up in q and something – over  of our ebitda was in q as well and i think this year were seeing with the delay of tax that its going to be more like  or less of our revenue and probably  to  of our ebitda will be in q and whats not showing up in q we are expecting to show up in q and then during the course of the year as steve was – earlier alluded to as you see a portfolio build what youre looking at is a combination of old cards are trading new cards coming on the new cards coming on at higher unit economics and the more they season the greater the revenue and the greater the ebitda so you would see that growing and we would expect our exit rate at the end of  to be above our entrance rate steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer thats sort of why  the sort of overview color that mark gave comes together fairly easily when you build your own models and we try to give you all enough information on this call to build your model and follow along at home and this way you can see where we are at the end of the year were cutting expenses but at the same time increasing the revenue being delivered from the portfolio so revenue is going up as the year goes on expenses coming down as the year goes on during the detour periods at green dot it was exactly opposite of that and that is expenses are going up as we invested in technology and did all these cool things but at the same time revenue is going down so we had the worst of both worlds and now we are going back into a more normalized rhythm if you check in your page you just  find helpful i think its page  of our investor deck is a chart it only shows our legacy business it doesnt show the consolidated entity but this is i think really what youre talking about thats our cards business – our retail cards business and it shows you what happened to our legacy revenue when we discontinued moneypak it goes all the way down it shows that it bottoms out in q  because of the seasonality of tax it comes a little bit up and then you start having our new products sell and populate the portfolio with higher fee cards and then we are forecast to hit the end of the detour in q  in other words we think we will still have pain as you have the old cards in our portfolio and then the reverse course has started going up in q  so thats sort of the plan of how the year shapes up because of the new initiatives and the new cards does that make sense ashish sabadra  deutsche bank securities inc yeah no it does and thanks thats very helpful maybe just a quick followup would be the comments on  when you talked about the eps of  what were your revenue assumptions around to get to that eps number and then if there were any delays in the product launches or anything could you still make it up through margin expansion so a twopoint question around whats the revenue assumption and then if there is any delays could you still make up that number steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thats a great question i think the way were thinking about this is looking at things as if we had a month year in front of us and that  was just a natural progression of where we are exiting  and continuing so we actually will say look to get to  were not going to assume anything special happens just because we changed to a new year but instead we would just continue as the portfolio ramps and then on the margin side we already have visibility into  million of efficiencies in part we had onetime costs for supply chain launch and weve paid for that already were not looking to pay for that out of future profitability but as a management team weve come together and figured out the way to drive efficiencies on the frontend and then realized the benefit as revenue grows over time ashish sabadra  deutsche bank securities inc no thats helpful and maybe then a final question would be on the buyback you mentioned  million of potential buyback this year just in terms of the buyback is it going to be more opportunistic or expecting to spread it out through the year steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thats a great question we intentionally have left our eps guidance without effect for the buyback because of course you know eps would be impacted by both the timing of when we bought back shares and the price at which we bought back shares all things being equal we would prefer to buy sooner rather than later to have more of an impact on this year and next ashish sabadra  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks thanks for the color steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure operator our next question will come from ashwin shirvaikar of citigroup please go ahead ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker great thanks so i guess the question i had for you was you have a number of these new initiatives with regards to what the bank side of the enterprise can do can you talk a little bit about the capital requirements as well as the cash flow expectations this year and next steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure you mean at the bank itself or the consolidated business ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker both i was just kind of wondering with regards to what sort of investments you would need to make in order to launch all of these products and then on  steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so the great news is any capex and we have jess unruh here who is our chief accounting officer capex peaks as we start rolling out just these – the process and the other things that have been driving a lot of that so we already have built into that capex the cost of anything wed need to build for all of our products and its very very little because thats what weve been doing over the past three years so weve been working on the processor the gobank product technology platform by the way let me talk about that because nobody asked about it but its kind of important the word gobank is a product in other words you sell a product under the gobank brand name but its also the underpinning guts if you will the technology platform that allows you to deposit a check or to do persontoperson payments or host an embedded savings account and sweep money back and forth all of that right now all of our prepay products sit on that same gobank platform if you were to buy a walmart moneycard and download the mobile app you would be shocked to see the similarities of gobank but thats allowed us to shutter if you will over time to shutter our old code thats  years plus old and retire those legacy processes so we are saving a lot of money as opposed to spending money in investments it sort of the opposite of what you think in other words as we roll out new products we are saving money not spending money on the new products the past three years were the spending years and now we are able to get to some of that money back in terms of roi so whatever you see in the plan is already paid for there is not a lot of incremental spending we have a lot of technologists were able to do green dot money inhouse if we need to bring in an occasional surge resource from a contractor we do but i dont think theres anything remarkable mark what mark l shifke  chief financial officer in fact – and consistent with that i think we would expect for next year our depreciation and amortization will actually be lower than it is for this year so steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah  mark l shifke  chief financial officer i think thats consistent with the fact that we met our spend as we need to and we are not looking for incremental this year steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah the last two years has been just so punishing for a number of reasons we are in this longterm strategic plan you invest in this technology you cant stop nor would it be smart to stop halfway through you assemble teams and you are writing code and you are hitting certain timelines and then the legacy business hits the skids with moneypak coming off the shelf and the private label portfolio with lower fees so you have your highest level of capex spending in history for the company at the same time that you have the lowest level of revenue generation from the legacy business so it was just the combination of those we didnt plan it that way it isnt what we thought would happen but if you look in rears factually thats what happened and so now its just such a joy to be able to look forward and say wow the process will roll out over the next number of months the new products are all in real life on the gobank platform they live they exist you can buy them and use them thats been done green dot money is under deployment and people are working at it i was at our shanghai tech facility a few weeks back going through what id call stack reviews with all of our leaders out there who were showing me the various products and how its coming along so i think were in better shape than weve been no guarantees you never know i mean anything can happen i suppose but this is certainly one of the better times weve felt in quite a while about the company ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker and when you think of entering into or engaging in consumer lending a secured credit card seems like an interesting product what is the risk profile of the consumer that youre targeting and why would they choose to use green dot as opposed to – there are a number of bank and nonbank choices available nowadays any thoughts on just the competitive landscape within lending which seems to be very busy steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yo yeah well so look as it relates to unsecured lending now ill tell you about the secured card in a minute unsecured lending that we dont have plans to do look there is no question that our customers who we love – i mean our customers are our family but just like maybe your crazy uncle bob at home or whatever everyone  you have to know your customers like you know your family and there is no question that a large percentage of our customers would love unsecured credit there is also no question that they wouldnt pay us back oftentimes so you have to be very careful with unsecured credit and so i think we have – were under a great idea with green dot money because its a lending marketplace that does not use green dot banks capital or the holding companys capital its experienced lenders who have been doing lending to low fico score consumers in many cases for  years  years  years they know how to do that in a way that is riskfree for green dot they know how to make money out of it we know how to introduce to the customers but theres no risk so thats how we think about the unsecured part of our world on the secured card side of our word just like the name implies the customer actually makes a deposit in green dot bank a collateral deposit – a security deposit and their credit line on that card is equal to whatever they have deposited in the bank the reason why green dot is such a natural fit for the product is number one people who are new to credit or people who have damaged credit are the people who are interested in a secured card it helps build your credit it helps establish a credit file if youre a young person lets say you turned  or  youre going to school its a great opportunity to build a credit file in a responsible way but you always spend on the card equal to the collateral deposit you put into the bank so theres no risk to the bank now what happens is over time every six months were going to evaluate that behavior if the customer has paid as agreed if theyre staying within their credit line if the transaction types are appropriate and all the other things you look at in the risk model well then you gradually raise their credit line so that it ultimately becomes an unsecured credit card but it has training wheels for the first six months or so or maybe longer so the bank has a really good understanding of who theyre lending money to thats how the product works for us at green dot its ideal because we also happen to own this massive green dot network location of  retailers where you can swipe a card give money to the cashier and that money magically appears in green dot bank right or any other bank thats part of our network that means that today the way you get a secured credit card from a major bank and all of them sell it or most of them sell it would have a secured card you have to go to the branch you have to somehow give them money write a check mom and dad has to write a check if youve low income you have to get a check we dont have a check its just not a great match for that kind of a product at green dot our customers know how to load money on their prepaid card i mean even with the moneypak issues we have  million reloads at retail in  so its very logical to say the consumer look thank you for applying you are automatically approved here is your card go to any green dot retailer swipe it at the register and put however much money in your green dot bank collateral account as you want and that will be a credit line and then perform well well raise it you will develop a credit history so its a very logical match how big that is how many consumers will have the discipline to put money away and perform the answer is a lot will a lot more will say they will but wont but ultimately we think its a great addon opportunity thats very consistent with our brand and our core products ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker great one last quick question when i look at the harvest capital presentation right and they obviously – they believe that eps can get to  by  which is basically something like   on a ratable basis by  and your counter is   and so i am kind of looking at that and thinking is there – are they being overly aggressive in some of their assumptions are there things that they feel that should be done that you feel shouldnt be other than same bank capital so trying to figure out the gap between – its not often that you see an activist comes out with a number and management comes back and says heres a lower number steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah oh gosh how do i say this because i want to be respectful and polite look i think if youre the activist and i dont know ive never been an activist weve been out this  years and ive never had anything like had happened so i cant tell you im experienced at it but my sense is that harvests job or any activist is to create excitement and thought around that process but look a lot of the things in the bridge slide that they have that shows the way to get to that eps number you just cant do you cant loan  even if you wanted to you cant loan  of your customers unsecured credit without driving the company into insolvency in six months you cant do that even if your regulators will let you do it which they never let you do it anyhow you cant lever up the balance sheet to do things that are not otherwise safe and secure in that way theres also other math that youd have to look at and try to figure out the math is accurate but i think – look i think directionally what harvest is saying is a fair point and that is hey look at if you grow revenue and you cut expenses that you should be able to do a better job at eps than what youve done so far and the answer is theyre right we couldnt necessarily do it in previous years while youre rolling out new technology products and while your legacy business is melting like an ice cube so you may not be able to do it then but directionally they are right but when you see some of the points they make im actually in violent agreement with many of them and that is roll out new products with better fee schedules check theyre right cut expenses check theyre right use the bank for other kinds of uses besides issuing prepaid cards and now again thats a regulated activity and we were lucky and fortunate to get approved by our regulars to lend but we just cant go off and do that right so i dont know what the difference is and its probably not a great use or an appropriate use of my time to go through and i dont have the deck in front of me so i forget what they have in there but many of the objectives were just not things you can do credibly or easily but forgetting about their number versus our number the concept that should we be able to make more money and cut more money and therefore cut expenses and therefore deliver wider eps the answer is yes we should yes we will and that point is well taken even if the actual recommendations are not plausible i guess is that a fair way to answer it ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker yeah yeah i appreciate the detail thank you for that steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer sure steven w streit  chairman president  chief executive officer okay folks i think were done for the day i dont have a watch in front of me but my cell phone says were done thank you all for listening we appreciate it well see you at shared confidences and oneonones coming up and we look forward to meeting with many of our

dotgreen dot’s steven streit the prepaid card kingcharles p wallacesep  fastgrowing green dot has walmart as an investor but its stock keeps falling fortune  not many fledgling entrepreneurs could survive the discovery that their brainchild was a flop but steven w streit  had a eureka moment that turned his fortunes around in  streit a former adultcontemporary radio programmer started a business called igen in the bedroom of his monrovia calif apartment the goal to give teenagers a debit card loaded with prepaid cash so that they could shop onlinewhen the card was rolled out kids didnt show much interest but adults who couldnt get checking accounts or credit bought the cards in droves using them for such prosaic tasks as paying household bills i thought we have the right product just the wrong target market so we retooled streit recallsstreit rechristened the company green dot gdot got backing from silicon valley venture firm sequoia capital and now is the largest provider of prepaid debit cards to the underbanked in america a class estimated at  million people green dot went public in  sequoias original  million stake is now worth around  millionits breakthrough came in  when walmart wmt partnered with it for the walmart moneycard which customers load with money when they cash a paycheck or tax refund at a walmart the retailer now accounts for  of green dots revenue which hit  million in s first quarter up  over  with  million cards outstanding it is far ahead of its closest rival netspend ntsp with  million walmart was so impressed that it bought  of the company last year even the us treasury has started a pilot program to issue tax refunds on green dot cardsyet green dot is facing some strong headwinds competition is heating up american express axp is introducing its own prepaid card and commercial banks are hinting they will join the fray although the amex card appears aimed at a niche market a way for people with normal checking accounts to give money to college kids for example it is charging minimal fees that could mean trouble for green dot which charges to buy the cards and reload them then adds a monthly maintenance fee now floridas attorney general is investigating prepaid firms to see whether they fully disclose their charges green dot insists it doeslegislative changes are another uncertainty the durbin amendment tucked into the doddfrank act specifically excluded prepaid cards from its limits on how much banks can charge for processing debit card transactions because they serve the lowincome market that could change if prepaid cards become more widely acceptedall those doubts have had a dampening effect on green dots stock which is selling at  about  below its ipo price of  thats down from  just a few months ago there is a lot of controversy over the stock because of doubts about future growth says tientsin huang a banking analyst at jp morgan who nonetheless has an overweight on

chief executive officer since january  and as chairman since february  he also served as our secretary from october  to april  and as our treasurer from october  to april  streit recently spoke with paymentsjournal regarding green dots current view on the marketpj how has green dot’s role in the prepaid market evolved over the years ss back in  green dot’s gpr card was originally introduced to provide teens who did not have access to a credit card the ability to shop online when we began selling the cards at retail we quickly learned that the product was instead being sought out by individuals who were looking for the benefits of plastic but didn’t qualify for credit cards or checking accounts over the past  years we have seen the product evolve into an everyday financial solution for many of our customers who are seeking a reliable “portable” bank account that suits their everyday needs we have seen evidence of that through the increased use of direct deposit as well as the number of individuals who are benefitting each month by meeting one of our usagebased fee waiving criteria as we continue to evolve as a company we continue to stay true to green dot’s core belief that financial products should be convenient transparent and easy to use pj more players are entering the prepaid market such as american express and chase us bank has been pushing its general purpose reloadable product for some time with that said will the market see contraction or consolidation among providers in the near futuress we see the interest from mainstream banks as a benefit to the industry as it lends additional credibility to the industry and raises awareness of the product category to an even wider segment of consumers we believe there is significant demand for prepaid financial services particularly in households making less than  annually and that this growing market can support the need for various competing products in the marketplace that being said we do expect to see tougher times for smaller providers whether that be consolidation or elimination we believe that green dot’s reputation for lowfee financial solutions and its strong brand and retail distribution network position us well to compete with newer players in the space and we continue to see an opportunity to grow our business over time pj with green dot as a vertically integrated supplier bank for issuing processor for payments what advantage does that give the company in the marketplace ss the acquisition of green dot bank is a key part of our ability to provide better products at lower costs to our customers the ability to issue cards from green dot bank sell those cards through our retail distribution network of more than  retailers and offer reload services via our green dot network provides us with a uniquely differentiated model that allows us to better control our cost structure improve our speed to market and better control our compliance obligations pj where does green dot see the opportunities to expand its customer basess we believe that many of our recently announced programs—such as aarp older americans rushcard those who identify w russell simmons and sallie mae college students—expand our reach into new segments of consumers within our target demographic we are also in the process of developing a mobilecentric checking account that we believe will address many of the key pain points felt by a very large customer base of individuals who are frustrated with big banks we believe green dot has a unique opportunity to be that financial solution for these consumerspj given the focus of consumer groups and regulators around cardholder complaints what can green dot andor the industry do to address systemic issues such as ach clearance and address such complaints that are now visible to the public thanks to the consumer financial protection bureauss green dot has always had a robust complaint resolution process and we take customer input good and bad very seriously with social media so prominent i think it’s fair to say that complaints on any product or service have already been public for some time we’re pleased to have an a bbb rating and very strong customer satisfaction scores and the ongoing monitoring and reporting of complaints will help us improve even more pj what mobile initiatives is green dot pursuing at the moment that it can share when do you think mobile remote deposit capture will be generally available to cardholdersss we believe mobile banking will play an increasingly important role for consumers’ everyday banking needs we have seen very encouraging adoption and usage trends for the mobile apps we have launched for our gpr platform since we have become a bank holding company we have been working on a mobilecentric checking account product and we expect to launch the product commercially sometime in  pj economic conditions increased marketing and strong consumer adoption has pushed gpr into a mainstream product however is the industry still faced with challenges around retention ss retention is an important puzzle that no company in gpr has really figured out yet part of the challenge is that many customers like the “nocommitment” nature of the prepaid card and many others intentionally purchase the product for a single need or purpose so retention for these customer segments is likely to be somewhat elusive however fortunately there are many other gpr customers who use the card as a checking account substitute and become long term users of the product we believe that the right mix of pricing and features will continue to help grow this “retaining” segment of customers over time pj looking forward what are your expectations for consumerbased prepaid productsss our expectation is that the product will become increasingly mainstream and more broadly distributed in many different channels over time this means products will likely have lower prices more features and higher utility for customers we believe green dot is well positioned for the future and are excited to be the leader in such an exciting and dynamic segment of financial servicesabout
