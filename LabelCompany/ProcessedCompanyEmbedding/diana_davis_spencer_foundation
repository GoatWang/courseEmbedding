creds of the diana davis spencer foundation — inside philanthropy k education september   here are the conservative ed creds of the diana davis spencer foundation september   brenden timpe for the diana davis spencer foundation there is no priority more important than the development of the next generation while the foundation uses its generous endowment to support a wide variety of interests education and children are clearly near the top of the priority list and the latest grants make clear that the foundation is not afraid to straddle the line between education and politics the foundation itself may be new but the family that runs it has plenty of experience in the philanthropic world its roots are in the wealth of shelby cullom davis a writer businessman politician and philanthropist his wealth was passed down to the kathryn w davis foundation which is now the diana davis spencer foundation that still carries plenty of weight in conservative circles today given this long history it’s no surprise that many of the foundation’s grantees are longterm beneficiaries groups like the federalist society for law and public policy studies receive consistent support however s crop of grantees include a number of new faces many of them geared toward education and education policy grants under the educational banner have grown steadily over the last three years totaling  in  alone many of these grants are apolitical for example the foundation for the first time supported turnaround for children a nonprofit that provides teacher training behavioral interventions and other services for lowperforming public schools in areas with high poverty the goal is to give students at these schools a better environment to learn — and thus a better opportunity to succeed on the political side the foundation launched its firstever support for the goldwater institute where a  donation is supporting the “education savings accounts challenges and choices for every child” initiative education savings accounts are much like school vouchers except that they give parents even wider latitude to spend their student’s funds the money can be used for private school tuition as school vouchers are or purchases like tutoring services and books the program has been implemented in arizona and the goldwater institute joined the state attorney general in defending its constitutionality in a court case like the like the turnaround for children project the foundation believes the education savings accounts effort will help underprivileged students – in arizona it is aimed at children with special needs and children in underperforming schools this is a common thread in much of the diana davis spencer foundation’s grantmaking those who break into the foundation’s selective group of grantees are often providing services to underprivileged children or advocating for conservative public policy that they believe will help them more k news inside philanthropy  main

davis spencer foundation give me liberty or give me death –patrick henry founding values the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure   — albert einstein our founding fathers enshrined freedom limited government and individual responsibility in the declaration of independence and the constitution they knew that these values would guide future generations to prosperity and happiness   today the growth of big government endangers these principles society increasingly depends on fiscally unsustainable entitlement and welfare programs   to guarantee their political social and economic freedoms americans must rediscover and apply their founding values we’re helping them do so through our support to a variety of research advocacy and educational organizations   for example the federalist society for law and public policy supports over  legal professionals committed to preserving constitutional government and the rule of law one generation away develops educational projects to teach americans of all ages about the constitution and how it applies to modern issues liberty’s promise instills our founding values in new immigrants and helps integrate them into american civic society   our founding values have provided over two centuries of economic political and moral guidance to citizens of the greatest nation in human history by understanding and upholding these values americans can ensure a free vibrant society for years to come public policy  the diana davis spencer foundation lincolndouglas debates public policy a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both — dwight eisenhower sound public policy encourages entrepreneurship and protects individual liberty with these principles under attack smart policies are needed now more than ever   a constantly expanding federal government threatens the freedoms of both states and citizens excessive regulations prevent entrepreneurs from creating and growing the small businesses that drive the economy   the diana davis spencer foundation is committed to downsizing government and opening markets so all americans can reach their potential that’s why we support institutes and think tanks that are researching developing and advocating less intrusive laws and regulations   for example the institute for justice intertwines public policy education and free enterprise they’ve been very successful cutting through government regulations and recently helped defend a group of monks whose handmade casket business was being strangled by unfair regulations   likewise the national right to work has empowered employees to fight back against discriminatory laws that force them to join unions against their will the heritage foundation has promoted free enterprise limited government solutions for decades   we’re empowering leaders who are committed to implementing policies that embody our founding principles diana davis spencer foundation mission the diana davis spencer foundation espouses the values upon which our nation was founded freedom and individual responsibility the mission of the foundation is to promote national security entrepreneurship selfreliance free enterprise and to enhance quality of life by supporting the arts education global understanding health advancements and preservation of the environment letter from the president dear friends   here at the diana davis spencer foundation we believe individuals are our most precious resource only by investing in them can we ensure a strong national defense a free society and a vibrant economy where innovation and entrepreneurship thrive   as one of the few philanthropic organizations focused on bolstering us national security we’ve committed extensive resources to support our military and intelligence communities   yet we recognize a strong national defense depends on more than just having the best training and information only an educated populace instilled with america’s founding values and unshackled from overbearing government institutions can secure the full blessings of liberty   this is why we’re collaborating with a host of likeminded groups to make those goals a reality with every grant the diana davis spencer foundation seeks to provide people with tools to take charge of their own lives from early education programs that enable students to accelerate their development to public policy institutes that help defend economic and political freedoms our foundation is committed to empowering individuals to reach their full potential   as we tackle current issues and take on new challenges we’re excited to continue making our nation and the world safer and more prosperous   sincerely diana davis spencer chairman and president entrepreneurship  the diana davis spencer foundation wright brothers’ first flight entrepreneurship genius is  percent perspiration and  percent inspiration — thomas edison small businesses drive economic growth they employ half of all us workers create two of every three new jobs and patent new inventions  times faster than large firms   but the future of small business is under threat americans are starting new businesses at the lowest rate in decades even as the small business failure rate increases due to suffocating regulations   to reverse this worrying trend we’re working to instill an entrepreneurial mindset in today’s youth   reviving american small business starts with teaching the entrepreneurs of tomorrow that’s why we’re working to expose students to entrepreneurship through education the network for teaching entrepreneurship encourages middle and high school students to establish their own businesses the students have the opportunity to present their business plans in competitions — and winners go on to compete in the national competition in new york city   we’re also proud to contribute to programs that promote social entrepreneurship such as college of atlantic global center for social entrepreneurship and bethesda green   another empowering organization rising tide capital teaches and assists lowincome entrepreneurs to build stronger businesses   teaching entrepreneurship isn’t merely a way to spur economic growth and job creation by inspiring people to turn their creative ideas and passions into business ventures we’re helping individuals unlock their full potential and
